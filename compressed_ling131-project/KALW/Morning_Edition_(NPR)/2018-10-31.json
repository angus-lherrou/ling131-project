I'm Rachel\nMartin when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are ... out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and\nAre enormously powerful and enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to first rolling aside it'll get paid by sorrows or somebody [noise] back\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump\nA large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Jeffrey her fire used that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio here the smartest man [noise]\nYou know talking about talking about the the lead you ever see the elite\nYou are the only [noise]\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jew is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred and in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays from member station WBFO easy in Chicago Suzie on reports\nAt a pop up Halloween store in downtown Chicago shoppers are trying on math and sword fighting with Tom\nThey used to be a lens ... for the weeks around Halloween Chicago costume company is bringing the shop back when the dead Halloween shopping is big business it's expected to generate nine billion\nDollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nWhen people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords ... short term leases that Steve Short with commercial real estate service Jay Aloul says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a lamb\nAlways a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting a model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials faces CEO Mohammed ... says everyone using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich should also be pushed coming from ... to regret and we walked in the past ... on that and we've seen a lot of British you know like fingers performers function with their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set up pop ups centered around a specific artist oh watched as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year and entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from the pop UPS Store\nYou're changing the traditional model of long term is\nYour ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up and it turns into a permanent tenet there is a solution ... right now the short term is than your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases friend PR News I'm Suzie on in Chicago

place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes yeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my aunts my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity\nAnd how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings\nShape how you're thinking about politics for the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been great so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I Believe doctor for it and I buy it\nDon't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough evidence that forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you'll hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for if I were to Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would\nPerhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people\nAlthough they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my

testing a new plan it's stated aim is to make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more\nIt's similar to the American credit score but much more sweeping attracts far more than financial transactions and it's called the social credit score Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast exploring\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created\nSomething quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is a lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is impacting economic activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust\nShe says a lack of trust in people and businesses has held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave\nCompanies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit for\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not ease your responsible so your school go up but if you buying video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data of its own and that\nData will factor into people's social credit scores to the social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty but we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Huron John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of one\nThousand or this you know a manager my score a full score says when thousands\nAnd there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so for nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus points isn't a eight hundred and fifty nine fifty nine points is uh\nBe eight forty nine to six hundred is a seat and this is considered a warning level\nBelow that you are a D you were labeled in untrustworthy citizen you can get points for all kinds of reasons get a DUI\nThat is an automatic downgrade to be and if you spread rumors on line minus fifty points if you really high score you get discounts and a bunch of local businesses your heating bill can go down you also get special invitations to community events\nHuron Jones says it's made people behave better before the pilot program being a pedestrian and wrong China was just terrifying you basically had to hurt yourself across the street when you saw breaking traffic\nIn that genre but now after um the changes have happened with the cars and they will wait for you\nKnow remember she John is an example of somebody with a perfect score if you're a social credit score is low or if you end up on something called the list of untrustworthy people you can be banned from certain kinds of travel or even suggested the public shaming life\nYou are news\nThis afternoon on all things considered life on the bad side of China

persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states all persons born here are citizens\nPresident Trump says he can go around that days before an election that he wants to make about immigration the president talked of trying to eliminate citizenship\nFor children born in the U.S to immigrants who are here illegally he says he could use an executive order although the Republican speaker of the house Paul Ryan says that is not possible Michael Anton is with us next the former white\nHouse aide was written in support of ending birthright citizenship and that particular case Mr Hands on walking back to the program Hi thank you for having I have to know the president raised this idea in his campaign years ago but hasn't tried it sense now raises it suddenly days before the election is this anything more than an election ploy\nWell I think so first of all he raised it in response to an asked questions so everyone who's looking for some kind of um you know deeply cynical motive here is wrong or he was asked a question apparently it's something he had been discussing with the staff for many weeks\nYeah he did say he'd been talking\nAbout a reporter got wind of that and ask him about it and he gave an honest answer I also you know I have to take issue with what you said in your opening that the\nThe fourteenth amendment is clear and therefore requires this practice what you read the amendment right and I think you I I'm pretty certain I Know you're misinterpreting the central cause subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nDoes not mean simply that you're subject to US law it's long been known in international law than any person who comes to another country for any reason whether they're there as a tourist whether there on business whether they're just transiting through as a matter of travel\nThey're subject to the law of that country while they're there also be physically present means are subject to the law in a sentence defining citizenship therefore subject to the jurisdiction\nMust have another meaning will or else it's ... there's this subject\nIn jurisdiction there uh when I've done some reading on this it appears to me that that applies to people like foreign diplomats who have immunity from American law but are you going to tell me that if someone is here illegally uh

will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota and a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the past\nBecause I just don't know I\nI I just felt stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk\nAbout the middle is not such a comfortable place right\nTwo extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that it seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or\nYou're out you're out of the group and there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nAll we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nPolitics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape\nShort it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all the families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Wanna go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise] so I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearing that Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those\nHow did those hearings\nShape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification\nThey're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it [noise] so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less as me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just
