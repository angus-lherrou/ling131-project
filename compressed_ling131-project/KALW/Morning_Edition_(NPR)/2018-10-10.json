President Trump says he is going to work quickly to find a replacement for Nikki Haley as US ambassador to the United nations hell emails to her departure yesterday morning President Trump was alongside her at the White House\nWhat we have a number of people that would very much like to do it it's a great position and Nikki realize she's uh she's she's making a much better position\nNow Haley is not leaving immediately she's going to stay on through the end of the year but this does mean at some point they'll be another high profile confirmation hearing\nIn the Senate a chance for Democrats to weigh in on the president's foreign policy democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware is one of those Democratic senators and he joins us this morning welcome senator\nThank you David good morning so you were one of only four senators to oppose Nikki Haley's um confirmation yesterday you said that she has helped move U.S interests forward at the United nations what does change your mind about her well I voted against\n'em then governor Nikki Haley because she had very little virtually no foreign policy experience\nA and she did not impress me and her confirmation hearing is having the relevant experience to be our lead spokes person at the United nations I after watching her performance and engaging with her regularly over several months\nI actually called her and said I made an I'd made a mistake and that I thought on human rights and an standing up to Russia She was a bright spot in the Trump administration's foreign policy team\nOf course I disagree with a number of the things that Trump Administration has done in foreign policy and she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un up but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in particular human rights than I initially had expected\nAcknowledging that you made a mistake to that um cause you to approach the next nomination differently I mean Dina Powell is someone who is being talked about she worked in the Bush administration but doesn't have a whole lot more foreign policy experience but that might you give the president a little more difference because you saw what happened with Nikki Haley\nWell I Know Dina and I know Dina fairly well as deputy national security advisor um she actually was very actively engaged in foreign
