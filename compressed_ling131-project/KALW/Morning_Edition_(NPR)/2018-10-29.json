Seventy people\nLost their lives and thinking also about your reaction to the revelations about the so called when rush generation we were wrongfully forced to leave this country having made their lives here for many many years you get angry in public that serves your issues well\nWhat I describe why there is ... baby passionate but I've got to say\nSeventy two people lost their lives in a fire that could have been prevented\nAnd absolutely we have to have politicians that will speak truth to power when you look at the faces of those who've died and when you challenge meal when rush\nBritain's stop deporting its own nationals to Australia in Eighteen sixty eight how can it be rights when we had a generation of people that arrived here from the Caribbean\nGave this country so much that you stripped them of their rights you ... them into tightened them you deny them access to pensions to health care\nAnd that is not something that should animate and make people furious that this has happened in Britain's name of course and let me just say these are the descendants\nCountry is horrendous and of course that has animated me because they included my parents and our generation bought it in parts of the rhetoric\nAnd the rhetoric around immigration is the rhetoric around different it's not consistent with a civilized democracy and we should call it what it is\nYou do not get to say that you're going to have trade deals with the wild and then treat the world's population at a ... because of your color on your off in such an atrocious why\nDo you believe looking at politics today that there is an institutional racism in for example the home office which which of course was the department responsible for for the wind rush decisions do you believe when you look at policing in London today that there is institutional racism\nRacism and discrimination exists in breast and of course it does I Do believe that the wind drops as an example of systemic discrimination against low hanging fruit which was British nationals\nWho ultimately was subjects because of empire treated as they were because of the color of their skin not if my seem fair beneath yes systemic prejudice and discrimination\nHow to handle it the best use the leverage you have I'm very mindful of your personal story you know you as you've just said you were brought up by a by a mother who came from guy on I made a life in North London lived in poverty your father left home\nYou manage to get a great education went to one of London's best universities to Harvard University\nAs well you now I've been going the barest a or a politician you have\nSucceeded in Britain despite everything that we've just discuss so how do you leverage walk power and influence you must it\nEvery day my life that is why it is so important to me to speak authentic Clinton and with power about the subject but let me just say that\nBut going back to where I began the report from the equality and human rights commission today saying Britain is seeing an alarming string of backward steps that it's in risk risk of becoming a to speed and two tiered society\nThat Eighteen years if it was in politics doesn't seem to have Neal did very much\nFor having a paradox Brits an addict fast is a country with someone like me kind of violence and do well it's a country relative in Europe which feels that it can be fair and you can get a fat Crocker the Ritz but yes\nThere are forces in this country don't want to take this country\nThey're all full sister ... the empire was good and that's why we should reject the European Union and recreate a new imperative them it doesn't seem to understand Britain's history and Britain's history is not just the history of\nWinning the war and Hitler and of King Henry and Henry it's a history also of colonialism an empire\nBerries good and that is bad in that story\nThe ...

choices but ... says that's still really high the masters doesn't add up\n... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than the station is being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nI Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought\n... cases and that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for

an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was\nPart of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of

into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption crime and\nThey ... the restoration of national pride I don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival of democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to report is about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge\nTo remind him and the people the people of Brazil about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right\nYet the prospect of more guns ... police violence social concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and
