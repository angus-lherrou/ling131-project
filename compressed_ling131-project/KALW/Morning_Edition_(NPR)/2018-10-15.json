Rachel Martin President Trump says the U.S is trying to figure\nPorter of journalists ... the president told sixty minutes that is the top leadership in Saudi Arabia is responsible there will be severe punishment Saudi Arabia continues to deny any involvement and said that if the U.S imposes sanctions it will retaliate\nThis was one subject covered in a wide ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump\nNPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now Corning good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be a Saudi has proven to have been behind us\nShe did not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales or ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action\nBut he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong\nAction and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be\nYes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House what did he say he did it has his position changed at all\nHe said he doesn't think it's a whole see uh and and he famously before he became president said it was a that that he believes climate change was hoped he said he doesn't think it's a hopes that any more but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back\nUh he was really pressed on this why he doesn't believe scientists or or believe some of his own scientists and he said that some scientists have political agendas and and that he so he would have to figure out what scientists are saying this because he thinks that some may be

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives in Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum show\nThem I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr if it if the point where it's it's more that\nPast seniors you're probably global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales as well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements today well an apt in the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer in and hopefully you know have people you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any of them said hey we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot of that um\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nI think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh come up as an\nIssue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with\nThe vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what ... Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this decision could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks in terms of the federal law raised a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell it you better make jak\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker this or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose people far industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations Eric\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional phones made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster is\nJust a forty miles\nTown the networks and the fried division of power held a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he ... on the Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nThat ... that aside at it\nIt wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas have lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard\nAnd the car industry is devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\n... debate it last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away\nLast April source of income us our livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do that in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler and Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything back to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know when you're you're talking to people that house was destroyed\nAll their belongings showed pictures there's no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild can you hold on I'm asking NPR News\nThis is NPR News\nNew across the country prison discipline coming down harder on winning you can get written up for not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without the mission and those low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time\nIt was sad because I'm this year\nI'm going to vote and\nAn NPR investigation this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nYou can hear all things considered later today at three o'clock here in Ninety One point seven K.

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and voted there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be a bowling because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks and Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nGood morning from the BBC in London unpredictable to see with BBC talkline some of our global stories this hour the king of Saudi Arabia is said to his ordered the country's public prosecutor to open an inquiry into the disappearance of journalists ... gee this comes of it\nAn Istanbul today where the journalist went missing elsewhere Malaysia's confirmed that eleven Muslim leaders from China have been allowed to travel to turkey to seek asylum there that's against the wishes of the Chinese the BBC's Michael Bristol explains what has become a complex story\nThe Chinese we use what parts of the group of about two hundred picked up and detained in Thailand while on their way to seek asylum in to keep the last year ... managed to escape that tide detention center a made their way to Malaysia they would need the rest is\nRenting the country illegally but the Malaysian prime minister is now confirmed they being released not allowed to go on to turkey\nAnd the main commercial border crossing between Syria and Jordan has reopened three years ago which was closed following its capture by rebel fighters Syrian forces retook the area in July Syrian students ...\n... for them to a lot that photo\nID and you guys started waiting at three AM so that he could be one of the first to cross back into Syria and see his hometown of Damascus again the closure of the crossing has had serious economic repercussions across the region from the BBC in London on ...\n[noise] sure if you don't tune in for the next edition of alternative radio and hear Chris Hedges ... and ...

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature\nAnd driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out of versus them President Trump it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington D. C. is the backstabbing duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in the small he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats and for the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal in more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and trade she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay columns thanks so much to say thank you\n[noise] the little ... from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep today is Monday the fifteenth of October twenty eight team that is the two hundred eighty eight day of the year Seventy seven days remaining until the end of the year sixty seven days until winter begins in twenty two days until elections\nAre you registered had steady your voter ... uh uh your voter pamphlet yet\nOne point seven KLW San Francisco KLW dot org your local public radio ...\nGood morning President Trump says there will be severe punishment if it turns out Saudi Arabia is responsible for the murder of a journalist\nThe president told sixty minutes potential sanctions against the Saudis are complicated because he doesn't want to give up a weapons deal I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin\nUniversity He goes on trial today the school is facing charges that it discriminates against Asian American applicants\nWholesome military exercise in your brain for the first time as Russia's power grab a country\nThat will share the story of the man he's turning his near death experiences\nOf public service campaigns Monday until the\nFive years on the news is next\nHello this is David all student with the b._b._c. news the BBC has compiled evidence that there's been more than a hundred chemical weapons attacks in Syria since president us had agreed to destroy his country's strokes five years ago now well on the Gadhafi has the details\nClaims about the use of chemical weapons has become one of the most hooky disputed areas in the Syrian civil war president outside denied ever using them\nBut to have investigation shows that they've been used repeatedly throughout the whole government forces are suspected of carrying out the majority of these strikes aiming to strike terror into civilian populations and driving them out to rebel held areas the vast majority killed or injured west civilians and opposition fighters\nSeventy nine of the cases examined in both the use of choking chlorine gas\nPresident Trump says king sign of Saudi Arabia has told him he has no knowledge of what happened to the missing Saudi journalist ...

from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin maybe this is you you see the signs at work or your pharmacy flu shots available but when are you going to make time and do the shots really work anyway this next story may change the way you think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades and estimated eighty thousand Americans died\nAnd a thirty nine year old St Louis Mandel is almost one of them now he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCharlie hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not somebody who's held in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week in a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nKind of fish or having from Shane rang out and\nStill have a call but by and large doses improved Jones who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu and actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity for Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings did get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but el the family members that came to visit got to do for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at him\nI was lying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so uh I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the sidewalk outside the NPR headquarters you may have to be careful not to trip over an electric scooter sitting there waiting for the next

San Francisco general and an assistant professor at UC SF California has welcomed e scooters even changing the law so writers don't have to wear helmets whereas other places like the city of Seattle are concerned enough about injuries that they're not allowing them at all\nWhen they enter the sector of transportation that's also entering the sector public health so it becomes a different ball game and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely\nIn San Francisco Juilliard as part of the city's injury prevention collaborative which is collecting data on Easter injuries are they happening at particular intersections our people fracturing goals or sprinting ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the trends are and where the low hanging fruit are\nAs a trauma surgeon Juilliard has seen the dangers but she also sees the potential because San Francisco is a city dealing with a lot of car traffic and so is Portland\nAnd have many more thousands of jobs many more thousands of residents were not going to be building many more thousands of St\nJohn ... is a spokesperson for Portland's bureau transportation to continue to have a city that works that move they want to welcome innovation knowing you can just hop on a scooter for a few bucks might encourage more people to leave their cars at home\nBut Portland wants to make sure these innovations meet all of the city's transportation goals moving people efficiently cutting emissions and making each trip as safe as possible\nThe same time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint that we think is a good one I don't know we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want arise and injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign [noise]\nBut you only have to look at the ... going by to see that this is a big change cars and scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and physicians will

their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be Saudi is proven to have been behind this he did not and\nAnd that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong action and\nHe at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yes so this was also in this interview the first time the

he famously before he became president said it was\nA that that he believes climate change was a hoax he said he doesn't think it's a hoax that any more but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back\nUh he was really pressed on this why he doesn't believe scientists a or believe some of his own scientists and he said

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum show\nThem I'm Still show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr if if the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably your global sales have been out facing\nYour domestic sales well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the store to store but yes the I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with it well a ... in the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts as fully and that's the point where we don't want to go\nOff it a little less or does the market go away and well we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you can burn some scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any of them said we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot um\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful\nTo us in the past few months he said the meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly did this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks and I guess if the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better making jak\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from a standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for a generation Derek\nGregory Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks and Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval of course he's at eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can cover that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nGood morning from the BBC in London on ... role should be busy talked plane a few stories we're following right now President Trump is treated that the king of Saudi Arabia has told him he has new knowledge about the fate of missing journalist ...

Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous\nWhy why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics the Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out today versus that President Trump did on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what was going to be as comfortable swimming in the small he\nWas I mean a lot of ways she created the swamp said that Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when you try to get them to talk about Trump is an ... or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks or\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and trade she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it as\nLike a ... inch of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay columns thanks so much for coming in thank you [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\n[noise] you are listening to the kale W's mine mix tape\n... lotion show [noise] protest but what does she chewed\nMy name is ...

encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nHinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that I figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's hills in their thirties Charlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at St Louis realtors association in like\nThink he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week in a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of

actually his wife had it to ... was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this\nFrom the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity\nBut Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings did get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three
