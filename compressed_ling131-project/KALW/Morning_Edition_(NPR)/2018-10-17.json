... she has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the streets when you're free to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think the more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or has an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way it was a story about about social media\nBut will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did you start this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship for the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also being part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd I might lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to this story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle\nSays you know where are your schools where the school so you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nHer organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it had been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story it's really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community of the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something going wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both a process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel

her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm diminution um\nWe have set it over and over that it's important for us the justice has gotten out of the six thousand years the women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this\nTo one as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot less to do what is next for you after winning this prize\nI'm twenty five to twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our message

we would like to see this never happen again not get any other community or any other religion or any other group\nAre you angry\nUs in the ...\nI can just simply saying I'm angry because of that word only will not describe how much we have suffered but what I can say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel every day\nOr what chemicals to showed him that you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful mess that we're not delivering a message to hurt anyone when I meet with students and residents and anyone\nI speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience that I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen\nAdam and new ... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard but that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman being victims\nAnd it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman's someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state

founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly for ... an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mother why did you start this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who cut along background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand of six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue the relationship for the country and she started up which are the first registered to vote in the ...\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love to love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her\nAnd the Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nGet Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was dealing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that ... had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she's had something on the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and the organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\nWell the story is really\nThe building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community you have the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something has gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're living as well at more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit things organizations have we
