in Turkey has released a pastor from North Carolina who'd been held under house arrest\nThe case of pastor Andrew Brunson has been a priority of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks and attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey\nRuns in his lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nAnd parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my case this one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him\nWell he's lived for a long time and his mirror in western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there\nAre but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there are some who have been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president rid of Tucker to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then and this year he was transferred of house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court say about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years of the prosecutor it asked for ten\nUh but at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a impart taking his health into consideration of the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted and he is now free to leave the country\nAre you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since there's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with\nThe shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why was it such a big priority for them\nWell the administration's well known for close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S is certainly a vice president Pence secretary state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency a also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions and lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey in President ... uh he's struggling to hold the economy together the currency is way down the inflation is soaring uh these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and on cabinet ministers\nHave added to the economic pain um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures will now be eased er lifted once pastor Brunson is back on us soil so are there going to be quite happy with that aspect of it and parents\nThis is NPR

released a pastor from North Carolina who'd been held under house arrest the case of pastor Andrew Brunson has been a priority of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks and attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey\nRuns in his lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my taste is one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him\nWell ease live for a long time and his mirror in western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there\nBut then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there are some who have been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president ... to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then in this year he was transferred to house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some church being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court say about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years of the prosecutor it asked for ten\nUh but at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a impart taking his health into consideration of the court also lifted judicial controls on brands and that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted and he is now free to leave the country\nAre you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only moved from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since there's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence in secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why was such a big priority for them\nWell or the administration's well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S certainly a vice president Pence secretary state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency are also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions and lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey in President ready to type aired one uh he's struggling to hold the economy together the currency is way down the inflation is soaring ah these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and on cabinet ministers\nHave added to the economic pain um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures when they'll be eased er lifted once pastor Brunson is back on us soil so are there going to be quite happy with that aspect of it\nNPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Peter thanks so much thanks Noah [noise]\nThis is NPR
