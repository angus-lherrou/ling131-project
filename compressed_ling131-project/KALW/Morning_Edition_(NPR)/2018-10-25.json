EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei\nHangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because China's stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou more into our what thirty percent drop for China stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\n[noise] we'll try this kind of me has been leading for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in the stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy if say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency of un is edits weakest link\nKeeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here Noel is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and start managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina by these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a communist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was\nAlready vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place their panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in\nAll sorts of ways and agriculture harvests oils frustration\nWith our sometime in ... he came to the conference to spread awareness about plunging so what does it\nChange or distributed letter technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like ... ... is like an accounting\nBook everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the ... transparency is the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to endings human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use blood chain\nMarket for people taking carbon out of the environment not a company has been launched yet\nBut that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because there's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things to fix climate change\nAre going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype we need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees\nBut she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something not solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change Locke says there's no time to waste sorting facts\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois have contributed more money to his own campaign any other candidate in

NYU school of law he says Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear to their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise in Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seat nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of four Republicans four Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the map\nBut the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change the system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretaries of state she says this whole thing is skewed to help Democrats\nA gimmick and bypasses are elected official in our democracy and if they want to have the pen they need to win

been building for years\nHe says that frustration came to a head in twenty sixteen\nPeople were dissatisfied with the government the federal level is really looking for members of Congress should their donors and corporations and their lift all the cool\nPolls looking at the redistricting proposal show it's been gaining popularity over the last few weeks but it's still a difficult subject to get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning in favor of the proposal\nWhy should the person in an office get to decide like who gets to vote in that area\nWhen I have a right to choose in and it just makes me wonder well how much right to do we really have\nEven if the redistricting measure passes that's not the end of the road legal challenges to

sponsored colleges schools with storied basketball programs such as the University of Kansas and low for among them ... longtime coach Rick Pitino was forced out of a job over all this but he was not even brought on trial\nNow joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption and college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also familiar voice on our program Heather Kevin hey are you doing I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know I'm not sure names\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on and ah\nBall for as long as I can remember and that is basically channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school\nAnd what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money\nSo that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize 'em by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years and it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow as I go out of Iowa which is which is a step\nAt absolutely now you could possibly go behind bars which is ah what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you see at the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by the system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under Institute double A. rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball programs in football programs are still going to get these talented players under they're very um [noise] a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is

rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets wings ... good morning oh\nAll right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on it's because\nInvestors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies\nUh you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three M which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts or this week talked about how that starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and\nHave been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall uh some companies are beating expectations and although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years now this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\n... well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically textbooks have already risen very high and I have a lot\nFurther to fall on and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about leaks sales or miss profits on that makes investors nervous that perhaps\nThose stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and AT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you\nNight but then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and send U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and\nThat's helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day and analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy had it how much our trade or it's going to affect companies and into investors feel they have a clearer picture on that\nYou are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance or later today with Amazon and Google alphabet recording their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thank you know\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chained the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science was talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in\nAll sorts of agriculture\nOr the oil's frustration\nOur sometime and co chairs the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about watching [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer Jew endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nFor gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\nNor is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits that since the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting\nEnd to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment now the company has been launched yet\nBut that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution the things that fix climate change\nAre going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research\nWell the hype we need to look past the shiny thing I've started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nFlushing could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees\nShe says it's dangerous to believe blocked Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something is solvable\nWith the clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nRent PR News I'm Sam\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois have

Steve Inskeep\nWe put your questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and government work either Cokie high fever and it's certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... sketch from Nashville, Tennessee in New York fatty Arabian special relationship really based primarily on an oil arms arrangement or there's something more to it\nWas not oil for arms and soil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential and the international setting of oil prices but it's also a purchaser as President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia is a check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues the U.S also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Shawn fits Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was a thing thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear\nHow oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S was Abdul Aziz evens out he\nHad forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those times the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman would have been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI this is Alex ... from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence of the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place\nBut because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting\nThe United states has sided with the thought is\nThat there is ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing as well ... thanks as always good to talk to you stay in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and
