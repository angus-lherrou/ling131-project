the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs\nOr business surprises me in a pool of me but um if you were to say that somebody was are to make a list of you know\nProgressive leaders they wants to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is\nThe single most important normal politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary or his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived\nBy separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics or religion life and he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market traders so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich [noise] well\nI'm In the nineties a specialty whereas\nA currency peg than looked\nAnd famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when the person's right\nA pound collapse or made enough food for sure and and the u._k. economy are

you kind of expanding rushing the birth actually is for them to be a girl the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure as a about where the donations go\nAnd that the critics you say ... I'm\nA ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nWhere Jewish finances are\nPortrayed as the shot or if it goes through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what do people in his native hungry think of Soros [noise] he was a hero or early on in the transition\nAway from communism\nThings have turned more recently because of

intelligence chief James Clapper has been located and there are similar activity surrounding senator Cory Booker the FBI says they've located another suspicious package that resembles the earlier ones addressed to him recovered it\nTwo places though one is the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia which is analyzing these devices may look like homemade pipe bombs and the experts at the FBI will be looking for clues\nAbout how the bombs were constructed there'll be looking for DNA are fingerprints the bomber bombers may have been left behind and retired investigators are telling me this is very promising because so many of these devices are intact they didn't blow up\nIf history as a guide do the whole process could take a little while 'cause it's a long time to analyze that stuff already says sense of being done in Quantico, Virginia you said there's a second area as well yeah last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility in Florida in ... near Miami\nThe operating

good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like that got ... Holloway\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all you can watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\n[noise] well these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was willing to take it a sufficiently seriously or one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the ... a former LA up a homicide detective ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of a African American relations with police officer she of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American\nShe felt was the acceptability of blackface\nYeah NBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWill for you and me it might be an abnormal exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah a of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is really interesting\nThe fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger\nThe way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuser foul balls at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer but I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that whole ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened a sheep and discussing with a network another role there uh because uh she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik

C. one person is now in federal custody after nationwide bomb scare the Justice Department will hold a news conference later this afternoon to share more details\nNow this news comes on follows the discovery of two more potentially threatening packages this morning one of them was addressed to new ... New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know about the person now in custody\nNot much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or\nI don't know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police their search to mail facility what were they looking for\nLast night authorities were searching a package sorting facility and Florida and open ... near Miami be operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility and through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV and Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right\nYes in Virginia the bulk of the investigation there is that the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs\nThey've been looking for clues for how the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing uh this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn the record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs couldn't presented a lethal threat to anyone\nOn background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing a law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that from former bomb analyst at the ATF have raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated it appeared\nFrom the photos that were made public that perhaps\nThese devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks I've had the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even is advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI faith see anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nContain anthrax or any material like that but that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's in all of these uh these bombs potential well\nSo law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here and PR
