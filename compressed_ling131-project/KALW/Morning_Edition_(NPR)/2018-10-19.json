United states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan the country has been planning parliamentary elections this weekend\nMost of the voting will proceed but in a very large populous province the voting has been postponed that after the attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walk through the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what we're supposed to happen this week and what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors and philosophy is\nA there was a lot of excitement about the election but also lots of scarring and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true awe and partly\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was going to a massive fraud so you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning lot of new fresh faces a lot of the ads on but also a great deal of worry uh\nYou've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what\nIs possibly going to be any different in a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a a measure taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to just sort of calm things down I mean kind of hard to very large province which is tough law it's police have its intelligence tastes and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think that's that obviously it measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take that help that that elections can be held there because it's a as you say very populous lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking famous one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process does do do feel like you're in the middle of a real election campaign where the people's will might be expressed\nI'd do it does a it's been it's been a a a nice experience so to speak out compared to previous elections here\nUm you know record record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with it which is extraordinary\nUp for a very traditional society like this one\nUp on the other hand candidates although they've been busy\nAn active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've ... they've been cautious they've had inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces and some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as we mentioned earlier that you had candidates have been killed and\nWell

from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five however laws changed since the Supreme Court granted blacks isn't the right to vote have white citizen at our faced barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early twenties centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines [noise]\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of course that men but given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans who they're voting rights in terms of light of course\nThe only until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before you're sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nDo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nAnd I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the region Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential street address Native American groups said it off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency\nAnd very dark ironies thanks so much Cokie good to talk to your\nCommentator Cokie Roberts was nowhere okay you're going to
