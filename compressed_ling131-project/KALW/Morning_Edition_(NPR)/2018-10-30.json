Inskeep a group of migrants is moving slowly through Mexico toward the U.S border this as President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand troops to the border\nAt rallies for Republican candidates the president has explicitly put the distant caravan at the center of the election campaign and election theme continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that range loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country\nThe president was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles outside the United states\nWith that said there is a group of several thousand migrants and there are varying descriptions of the group size and purpose\nSo let's check on the latest facts yesterday on this program we heard from Mexico's ambassador to the United states who said the group was smaller than otherwise reported about thirty five hundred people he said was some of them accepting asylum offers\nTo stay in Mexico we've next called journalist David ... who was recently with the group to ask\nObviously the official number that was given at the time the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred us to go home voluntarily mayors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is based because on the number of people that they were serving a because they're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many are truly determined to pass on to the United states given that they have this Mexican offer of asylum\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were wanting to work in northern Mexico\nYou mentioned that you did not encounter very many people accepting this offer of asylum the Mexican authorities have given a fairly substantial number of people who have accepted the offer it could it be that you would not have run into those people because they've already left the caravan\nThat's possible I mean one thing I I came across for example in in one city the city of weeks that was closer to the border with bought them all the people\nAre I remembered the mayor saying that they had eight people who'd accepted trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and\nAmong that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise] um [noise] but ... it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than\nA usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question that everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty [noise]\nAh and also family reunification so there's a combination of people that their parents or their children are in the United states and they want to reach them and see them again they hadn't seen them for years in some cases the the appeal of the U.S to you they will say swing you American or the the ability to make in an hour in the United states would they would make it\nAnd maybe in a

grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with rich Moran\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I was saying hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied\nBut it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know a lot you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're he ... his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\n[noise] and I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's a it's a process\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience affect your thinking\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it and why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not\nRight now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons\nAnd we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is that state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means is about your your who everyone wants President Trump especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done and the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now in all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nFluffy I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how was your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got us back to my last breath\nIsabel thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\n\nRachel Martin speaking there too is a bill Simon\nAnd this is NPR News\n... hours after eleven and people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue President Trump held a campaign rally\nWe just live evil change our life and change our schedule\nIs changing his scheduled to be in Pittsburgh today but not everyone wants from there I'm Ari Shapiro reaction to the president's trip this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nYou can hear all things considered this afternoon at three o'clock here on ...

about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with Rachel Martin\nSo when did you figure out\nFrom me I first I was saying hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied\nBut it got to the point where he would hug me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know a lot you know as I was reading in bed you know is very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm well your father and his grandfather and my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that ah [noise] the state and yet he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for\nAlmost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that Senate seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's a it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but\nNot everyone can afford it and why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get\nThe help our candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ...\nI think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need\nTo make it through the day sometimes or you're talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to actually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to you\nI still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your who everyone wants President Trump especially wants to keep your vote or with the G O P even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is unnecessary [noise]\nOh I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants what's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nFluffy I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I got his back till my last\nBreath miss about thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel
