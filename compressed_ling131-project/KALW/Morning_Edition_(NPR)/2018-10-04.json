good morning ritual do you agree with Senator Graham has the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination unified the Republican Party\nYeah absolutely I mean look I think for the last two years there's been a lot of Republicans who really like Donald Trump's policies but don't necessarily like his personality and I think that's been a drag on Republicans when it comes to the polls especially we should be the twenty eighth\nTeam midterms were you just haven't seen the urban doozy as I'm On our side as you've seen on the Democratic side but now the selection is not about Donald Trump it has to reach the election at least at the moment is about Brett Kavanaugh who's been dominating the national conversation and the and the campaign debates for the last two weeks\nAnd Republicans universally believe that he is an incredibly well qualified nominee deserves to be confirmed and it's just disgusted at the way I'm a crafts and some and the media has treated them\n[noise] um we should say there's a new

I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC and I'm David Greene in Culver City California let's continue our series on how China is trying to influence the world this is being felt across the globe today in many ways\nBut what China's leaders really want is to shape how the world perceives their country they're devoted massive resources to this and the center of these efforts to shape perceptions is China's Supreme leader himself choosing paying NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing on cheese message and his media [noise]\nThe China Daily is the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation I met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media\nOne of them Gary said that no matter what's going on president Xi Jinping is always at the top of the news in fact he says that's a rule that the government's mobile news app which China Daily runs\nLegal to seize students cheating on that details on using residue cheating paying always comes first he says in Premier League coach ... second that's not to say that they make news every day\nBut even if they don't their new stays in the top two positions\nAnother journalist named Miranda says that news about she is edited with extreme caution\nYou wish you\nThe only way to the if we can possibly avoid using a name\nIn serious consequences\nChinese state media to pick she is both a forceful visionary leader but also it down to earth man of the people\nOne minute they from the cheese achievements and building China into an economic powerhouse the next they show him holding an umbrella for his wife ...\nMeanwhile she himself has embraced\nSocial media and used it to broadcast simple earthy messages here he is delivering a characteristic line in a New Year's address and twenty Fifteen\nShows on ... a Sharpie Mooney fucking bow\nMeat pies don't just following the sky he observes the oh he adds we've all just kind of roll up our sleeves and get down to work\nMiranda says some of it seems to work on a domestic audience\nWas having the town let's not even the outer generation of my family and my classmates all have pictures that she and hung on their walls [noise]\nFrom what I see there's a lot more a part time his family life compared to previous leaders but\nBehind the feel good coverage she's use of the media has helped him to consolidate his own political power to a degree not seen in China for decades\nParty controls the media\nAnd of course that will control the message and basically she thinking well\nThe message that's University of Hong Kong media expert David ... he argues that the media is obsessive focus on Xi Jinping is displacing or racing other important news contributing to an information vacuum about China just won the world can least afford it\nBut new show you know media scholar of communication University of China in Beijing argues that China needs to focus on a main character to tell a story effectively and she is that character\nOn the hog I Wonder if I'm going to leave but she and we call her leader promoter and chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very seriously\nChina began taking its image building very seriously before she Jinping became president do traces this back to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympics he says that many Chinese felt that foreign media criticism of their pollution and human rights record spoiled their moment in the world spotlight\n... to go to ... down at the we felt or ability transmitter views was inadequate\nWe're unable to speak up\nSince then China has poured billions of dollars into its state run media hiring journalists and public relations firms\nFor example the official new Chinese news agency or shouldn't why has expanded its overseas bureaus from a hundred to a hundred and eighty and less than a decade state broadcaster China radio international meanwhile has expanded to allow it to put out twenty seven hundred hours of programming a day in sixty one languages\nThe message to his audience who says David ... is that China's rise is a boon to all nations China portrays itself as a provider of public services and solutions to global problems\nThis is all about China's position in the world are in a sense trying his rightful\nPosition in the world economy will turn to southern ... for China\nWill for all caught up with\nThis in court and new foreign policy up the belt and road\nMore than Seventy countries have signed on to participate in Xi Jinping's signature policy aimed at building infrastructure ports in roads linking the world to China of course China is hardly alone in its focus on its leader and his policies\nMaria ... a media expert at Georgia State university says Xi Jinping has a lot in common with other leaders from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Turkey's Reggie uptight ear to want to even US President Donald Trump all of them she says use social media to portray themselves as political strongman\nAnd to put out nationalist and populist messages\nKind of the high like a new leader and stuff that he's he's now at the humor and the communication channel is a kind of you know\nThat China's story and its example of high speed economic growth is found more receptive audiences in many developing countries\nWe should think about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and a partner investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst Wu Tang says that China is having a harder time coming up with ideas that appealed to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which hit argues don't fit China\nWill lose weight on means ... then ... them to\nTrain those leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that gives him a very little room to express himself\nIf China has an alternative to what the west considers universal values it hasn't been clear about what those are despite this China appears to a foot influencing foreign perceptions high on its agenda one of the young China Daily journalist named Bridgette suggests that this shift as a parent in her newspapers slogan\nWhom she and I sure young from for our modern city in China and go out into the world and like the world understand China\nNow its report on China and influenced the world\nThis model doesn't make it explicit but it's clear from China's media policies that their intent is not just to shake the world in a way that suits China's interests but also to leave president Xi Jinping's indelible mark on it Anthony Kuhn

NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rock right now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nThe soccer stadium right in downtown rock uh this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting\nThat now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nBoth Steve a rug has seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings is sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above\nHomes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes and ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa such as bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized\nAnd ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much Tom You're welcome Steve

a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met the you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm\nTyping with what happened but\nThey certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were\nVery very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um where engaged in\nYou know political campaigning\nUm they\nCertainly didn't take any known since from us that was a ... a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well\nKind of common for special needs parents so they were\nQuite a strong set of women I mean\nVery different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels [noise] uh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's just that one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is\nYou know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't matter how much you

children most of us children\nProbably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things I checked infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey're they're very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what you can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that\nOld some of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side\nAnd

jumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why\nIt affected one twin and not another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that some people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that unique affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families have a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access a school um\n... be able to go back in and work again what they're going to do about child care and
