at three o'clock here on Ninety One point seven KLW new trade agreement between Canada and Mexico would require auto makers to boost the percentage of auto parts made in North America\nOr some parts that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles are likely going to go up\nComing up potential impacts of the trade deal that's in a few minutes here on KLW field of nursing has played with gender stereotypes nearly Ninety percent of all nurses or women had white more men or nurses and the morning on the neck in the next half hour\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom in wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists\nHad bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics he says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with\nWorkers that are earning higher wages\nAnd that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up mobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...

first to receive a Nobel in physics in decades NPR's Geoff Brumfiel is years after morning good morning okay the pairing first is your ... or French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a tripped pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stole it out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big\nThe Nobel Prize in physics well this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald strict than was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are that sad woman ever getting that no prize in physics let's comments on that\nOkay I can\nBut it is true yeah there's only been issue others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there are many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant that in the heart scientists especially a Internet entrepreneur and sort of this new age ... have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was first three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that\nThat's really interesting okay there is a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe can is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are pulse simplification gets used a and laser eye surgery on this day changed the lives of many people over the last many years fortunately not mine so the glass okay All right Jeff thanks very much for your ah twenty\nTwenty vision on the Nobel

own behalf\nUm number one in the class I thought well no no no no no no I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city on mocked me\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what\nHappened to her trace there's been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and\nIt obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who are the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to the to this is our revolutionary moment\nBut when they made their new nation they caught aside some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nFranchise men and women you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who has been\nThe leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill and his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the

patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a ... pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stole it out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see strictly to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald Strickland was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that fact\nYou are that the woman ever getting that no prize in physics let's comments on that\n... okay I I think\nSo but it is true you know there's only been a few others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked does surprise does\nThis suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nIn the in the heart scientists especially a Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was first three million dollars the Nobel search just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that that's\nReally interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe gun is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which a slight tumbled physical things objects wow and that\nActually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... ... individual Adams even while and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are pulse simplification gets used to and laser eye surgery want this day changed the lives of many people over the last many years\nFortunately not mine so the glass okay All

minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the total was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his\nTo half a number one in the class and I thought oh no no no no no\nOh I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city on ...\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her trace there's\nBeen exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and\nImportant and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to the to this is our revolutionary moment\nBut when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who has been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that\nGets lost [laughter] is that the definition of sexual harassment\nColor who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases that having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a race\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [laughter]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and bad

prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs\nTo hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke so\nThe classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWow and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge list to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea and the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case she had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the health care industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital they would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called them the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here foreign employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print and your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices\nMarshall Allen at ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much Steve\nThis is NPR News\nToday is Tuesday the second of October twenty Eighteen it is the two hundred Seventy
