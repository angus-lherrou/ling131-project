leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and\nI think she'll probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says

no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nAnd we have to go out to be and how did all this stuff up used to let you know from that were from DC shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution\nDeveloping new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including anti bodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel that the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular pursue\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France was Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years I'm deprived can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up\nAll right NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce with the news of the

the huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to

a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone

members of this NPR station\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nRecall them earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice vote and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of her question it's interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn round off in the house of representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew 'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth so Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result\nOf what is it worth his lifetime appointments\nLots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a man\nEighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go

Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nAnd we have to go talk to me and all this stuff up used to let you know from from DC shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate asks you to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness soon to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nIs to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did you took phage display and applied to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how\nDid that practically change our world well you know\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel that the Nobel ours are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular pursue\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France was Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years I'm deprived can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up\nAll right NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce with the

money on it well he ran anyone but he doesn't seem to be making money that's at Forbes magazine has found in an extensive piece of reporting on President Trump's finances\nThis comes just as the New York times reports that much of the Trump fortune was the result of elaborate scheme to avoid taxes Dan Alexander of Forbes has been reporting extensively on President Trump's finances and he joined us from our studios in New York Dan thanks for being here thanks for having me your story says Donald Trump's net worth\nPresident Trump that worth has dropped more than a billion dollars since he declared he was going to run in twenty sixteen how did that happen\nWell there are a couple of different factors there you know part of it's just business markets part of it's doing better reporting figuring out things like he was lying about the size of his penthouse for years and now we know that it's smaller than he said but the most interesting part is the effect that trumps the presidency is having on Trump the brand\nSo um this is a brand that is so intrinsically linked to him I mean he puts his name on everything from stakes to hotels to neck ties um can you point to which of those products or buildings for that matter are suffering and and why specifically\nProduct business almost doesn't exist anymore businesses just don't want to take the risk of putting name on his name on their products and you know he'd build a lot of things in New York and New York is not a place that\nUh is very friendly to him these days the New Yorkers don't want to live in his buildings and golfers aren't spending as much money at his properties either she at all that up\nAnd it leads to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for the president\nGolfers don't want to go to his golf courses even though he intentionally spends the bulk of his free time at his golf courses\nYou know it's interesting even if you look at the three courses that he attends to most of the places where you know as somebody is grabbing a burger on the turn they can run into the president of the United states revenues are down even there so it just seems like\nYou know we talked with a lot of people who are around those courses and they said it's kind of a hassle you know you've got metal detectors and bomb sniffing dogs and\nSo we don't they don't mind that I ... it's just too much of a security

Hampton Sides has been exploring the origins of the U. S. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\n[noise] that's\nA radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea had started the war invading the U.S back so the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\n\nDouglas MacArthur is landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war and read the turning point as a fresh started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital and he began to get kind of greedy\nMacArthur devised next why stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMick Arthur's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it\nTo keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario for and circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on you\nKnow this is Hector calf Retta to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty of thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than there are ways sixty bitter miles to the evacuation important to them not\nSo bad mouthing the prices they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korea leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved just soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered he had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruin says they took it back\nThe capital city of\nImmediately volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard\nAnd ... what ... experiences\nAs an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it\nHe hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life and that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she joined her family and and made it to the south\nLeave by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by sort of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizens and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding\nNuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to be with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there are so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the

public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so many potential witness for victim is um let's say ten in\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering the question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like\nChecks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something the FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower\nStill Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he hopes to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time\nWeeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin

News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who have been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room\nAt the end for blacks\nAnd no place in the constitution for women and in our America there should be no seat on the Supreme\nCourt for Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battled over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes content\nDoes your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents are sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean that is not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused removed Justice John Rutledge until the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew 'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my heart from birth Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIt's so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments\nWell lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age them both uh they've been talk of the Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and use names commentator\nCokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and the government work by
