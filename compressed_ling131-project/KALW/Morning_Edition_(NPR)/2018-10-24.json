take some of that power away\nYou know the audience they had a faith based approach to mid term elections you always pray that the candidates would win but we didn't do much else democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning for years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures\nState lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw the district lines for future elections solve our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nDepart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact\nThat state and local governments have\nMet Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time high you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the store called trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine to see just uh\nFurther compounding what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up\nOn the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representatives that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system women districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um\nHow do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically it'd be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue\nA and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most was shelved member station K. U. T. has more\nRushing into Austin reservoirs had the look of chocolate milk\nIsn't so turned off by flooding around filthy even when it goes to Austin treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve water and as\n... you can probably guess what happened next and I'm calling me as I\nFind here yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply haven't proven the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many bottles people could buy\nIt just inconvenient at this point but I started thinking about you know just daily things that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years it has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nBritain as there is is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and a water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a sense is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up more silt and the river could\nLast days beyond that for NPR News I'm most of the show in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News\n... small and how they unified theme\nCare John firsthand how important health care and her

the Trump Administration hasn't had to deal with much oversight from Congress yet\nWhat we've seen is not only a a stretch of time when you have an executive branch that has been breaking norms that you have a Congress is set by and allow that to happen\nThat could change in a big way however if the Democrats win control of the house that story and more coming up in your next half hour of MORNING EDITION here on KLW also that killed ...\nWhat we've seen is not only a a a stretch of time when you have an executive branch that has been breaking norms but you have a Congress is set by without

it here she is last week at Harvard Institute of politics\nAnd there and\nI live\nClose he says Democrats should go after Trump's tax returns he's refused to disclose them Democrats would have the authority to get them\nAt the house intelligence committee perspective chair Adam Schiff of California says he would probe allegations that Russia has financial leverage over Trump the Trump

freedom of Information Act Austin ... is director of American oversight a progressive group this now filing for ya request\nIs actually very difficult to enforce the congressional Fifteen a court in contrast a freedom of Information Act request which we could file we can go to court very easily and force agencies to be transparent\nIt's worth noting this for your strategy was owned by conservative groups didn't the Obama era\nHouse Democrats plan to have all the committee's doing oversight investigating cabinet secretaries who broke the rules protecting Obamacare finding out what went wrong with hurricane relief and tackling other issues that Republicans have brushed off\nOne master of oversight is former congressman Henry Waxman during forty years in the house he investigated everything from the tobacco industry to the Iraq War\nWaxman listed three goals have good oversight stopped a waste of money hold people accountable and make government work the way it should just word of caution to House Democrats don't do oversight the way the Republicans have recently\nThe committees that Congress used their power which is in credible amount of power and abused it for simply

Ryan Lucas Ryan good morning the morning how much is the secret service saying\nWell they aren't saying a whole lot right now and this is something that really is just breaking news on they have sent out a statement at this point than what they are saying is that a secret service intercepted too suspicious packages one was addressed to Hillary Clinton at her home in Westchester County New York that one was discovered late last night\nAnd then early this morning a the secret service or intercepted a second package that was addressed to block Obama\nRight and what the Secret Service is saying is that both packages were immediately identified during routine screening as potential explosive devices or they say that night uh Clinton or Obama ever received the packages they weren't in their hands they weren't in their houses but they were addressed to them that's as as as far as they got\nA the secret service is working with the FBI with uh the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\nOn as well as state and local law enforcement or try to figure out as much as they can\nBe if it had something meaningful here because there are a lot of different things that could be in

approach to mid term elections you always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nDepart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact\nThat state and local governments have\nMet Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the stark will trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and a number of other states are quite close further compounding or what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes\nSo it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up\nOn the verge of being tie between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign there are some pretty ...\nBut for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve where Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed to have local representatives that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC ... Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful and understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand town that went all the way down to the state level um\nHow do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Nineteen\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for our way of I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically it'd be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue\nA and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... of member station K.

restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you need a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail

spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control
