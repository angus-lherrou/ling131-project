moth radio hour I'm Sarah often Jeanette producing director of them off and I'll be your host this time\nAt the mall people tell true stories from their lives they stand on stage in bars and clubs in theaters and they tell these stories without to audiences all around the country\nThis hour we have three stories for you will hear from the writer Jamaican cave on her trip to visit her\nAs a nine year old as punishment journalist Sebastian younger remembers his final story from the front lines of war and Josh Axelrod a former professional card player tells our first story\nJosh spent years as a card countered with a team of blackjack players but the story you're about to hear it takes place well after that when Josh found himself alone in a tiny rundown casino desperately waiting for two lucky lady [noise] he told the story at a mosque night called sensors\n\nReady tidy okay [noise]\nTwo months ago I was in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine was visiting Portland, Oregon and ah so I've driven down to to see him um [noise] but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know\nAnd uh I saw just because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was at a casino and uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a\nA legitimate um mathematically valid method for winning of the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me as adults a hand he gets a twenty as his hand but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of two cranes of ... screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe um everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to count cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of\nFriends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it to a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you're distributed five thousand dollars strap here ten thousand dollars trapped there and everybody gathers around ecstatic and it's almost like they're feeding off your own flesh and [noise]\nAfter earning my living that way for several years I sold a book about the experience of memoir\nUm and I sat down to write it but I thought that I should procrastinate first and so I played a a sort of like a little bit of poker on the Internet which is ... like blackjack that one can when I've won acquires a certain skill set that I had never happened to acquire a ... who are badly and I managed to\nLose a couple of thousand dollars and I became upset\nThat I lost a couple of thousand dollars and so I proceeded to lose ten thousand dollars out of anger and that made me really furious and I spent the next year\nA sitting at the computer in a pathological stupor just pressing this button going broke by the end of\nThe year I'd vaporized fifty grand I was in debt\nAnd I was surrounded not by these extraordinary mentors or that I I used to have around me but by the ex these other people who were strangers ah who's last names I didn't even know who had these haunted eyes and these over gone expressions\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team in the sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlines in the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is everything going to be All right\nThank you\n\nJosh kind of for the actual rich\nRock is unfairly dark men more I think life professional card counting blackjack prior ... sat down to talk to Josh that if history with them on here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story at a party\nWas totally silent with everybody turn to you\nHolding their attention telling this unbelievably riveting story and thinking that at this party is actually what we want them off to be and he has to come do this at the players got it in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever\nMight happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person who is in fact a lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning casinos and has\nOr in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this two groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was harrowing it's like a different body experience through there and the spotlight is on you you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh Axelrod was on a new play list at casinos he was appearing on them off stage under an assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still had some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as you know it's become increasingly aware of it but also because it's long been obvious to me that a card carrying reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] present a piece of ID to a person the casino\nHe can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know there's the ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id\nTo hear the rest of this interview and for a bonus material related to all the stories you hear on the radio hour go to a mosque dot org\n[noise]\n\n\nIn a moment we'll be back with this story about a young girls effort to keep her mom all to herself [noise]\n\n\n\nMore radio was produced by Atlanta public media in Woods Hole

Burlington, Vermont editorial mosque shall we produce ph international and Vermont\nRadio seem wise\n[noise]\nWhat did I was hoping I Would have an accident and I wouldn't be able to come up here but uh\nTry as I said nothing worked a\nT didn't spell a\n[laughter] I'm\nLike most people in the word I had a mother and ah\nShe had a sister and uh they were very ah oh on like each other and so the court ruled all the time uh\nMy mother lived in on the ... and her six to where I was born and uh\nAnd grow up and uh her sister lived in Dominique her where she was born and where she\nGrew up they call rode a\nBike letters they wrote to each other\nA letters that they would see up in an envelope and post uh and uh the letters would be taken on a boat that would make weekly stopped from the island of the ... islands I think you would in Wynwood islands [noise] um [noise] and\nUh the letters a word that they send to each other was written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... uh the letters um\n[noise] uh I never knew what the court was about because\nWhen they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English they then would respond to the left has verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly uh\nInteresting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me\nI I'm a door to her but mostly what I adored about tours that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry and speaking English language which I had no interest in learning at all\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also we were told\n'em [noise]\nEventually uh well as I say I was very I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother\nBecame pregnant I don't know how this happened\nShe I did have a stepfather her husband but still this pregnancy a\nWas a mystery to me and I had nothing to do with it I wanted nothing to do with it I quite in fact I ignored it um and so it was a surprise uh to me that\nShe gave birth to a ...\nSon her um other child um [noise]\nUm my parents tried very hard to you know make me like him I Would tell me to hold him and so on and\nA I must have done\nAh because one day when um they asked me to hold him he's slipped out of my arms and fell on his head\nThey were very angry at that I think because they made me eat my supper all by myself outside\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I felt war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand\nDollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is the story of all to try to learn to be a war reporter at war with all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and wars of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken\nBy surprise military forces\nAre and\nTook her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then the\nIt was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot and\n... the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish\nOn her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few\nA ceremony and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they\nArgued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I can see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun ... started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was the attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in\nCombat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost\nCalled Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and I'm like this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd ... some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sound of bullets make when they go past you\nIs pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face if that's what I felt what's the angles\nDeviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about\nEating the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was ripe right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he\nGrabs Sufi throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest the grass and stuff it's throwing image of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then a fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave\nA lot of braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call every step up and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I ... I asked for my feelings on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of he left So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that same broke his leg is it ten thousand feet up in the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going\nTo get hammered here's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg was for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down on that mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very\nTook me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm the scene where I'm riding in a Humvee cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nI riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up he went off under the engine block though instead of under us so we live\nThat whole rest of the day I was just on this\nKilled to crank you up [noise] incredible and that night I just sank I spiraled down in this black hole war is a lot of things it's incredibly exciting and I hate to put it that way but I'm not up here to lie to you it's really exciting and it's really scary\nAnd it's really intense and it's really meaningful but it's also incredibly sad and sadness is a kind of delicate emotion that's easily\nEasily travel by other feelings\nAnd that night I got in touch with the sadness of the whole thing politics aside just the fact that people are doing this to each other it crushed me and that sadness lasted exactly until the next time we got shot at and I was back in the", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
