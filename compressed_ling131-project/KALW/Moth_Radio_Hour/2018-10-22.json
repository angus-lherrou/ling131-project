I was like yeah lady cool it I'm new here\nAnd there was a kid in front of a class with him as Brad hey turn around and looked at me and said she just say Osama bin Laden\nWas like no she didn't say Osama bin Laden\nHe was like All right very next day I go to class ... walks right up to me is if I talk to my dad about you I was like oh boy [laughter] what do you say\nAre you an al ...\nI was like no I'm not not ... because like All right thank God we can be friends then [noise]\nI'm actually this could have been idiot that's all it took [noise]\nI can go to the FAA like that [noise]\nSo maybe it was starting to Missouri was a very very difficult but not everyone is bad actually made a best friend the first day his name is Brenda Brenda was great he had moved to my town from buffalo Missouri and he moved there because his dad was a preacher and he was going to take over the local church and brought it was great you would later become the captain of all the sports teams at high school and\nHe loved the town he said Omar you're going to love it here everyone is so nice and friendly like for example I just thought my hair cut at this guy named Troy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see\nSo then that day when my dad picked me up I was like dad\nLet's go to choice for haircuts so we went to Troy and Troy is is a mobile home\nWith like a barber chair in there and so we walk in and there's a Confederate flag hanging up\nAnd my dad like yeah I think we'd better leave\nNobody know down we're going to stay tries to best [noise]\n... like\nWe're not taking any new clientele\nAnd you'd better get home before it gets dark and I was like this business models swat [noise]\nNo one in here\nAnd my dad lives were gone\nAnd we got back in the car and on the way home my dad didn't say anything\nAbout it and didn't need to we still haven't said anything about it to this day because he must have realized that he had taken us to a place where we didn't even feel safe getting her hair cut\nAnd it must have been especially taxing for him because there's a strong Pakistani man he cared about family more than everything\nAnd\nIt weighed heavily on him but over time we really started to feel like we were a part of Missouri people there are super friendly and ... even though they're pretty race us [noise]\nI live in San Francisco right now people there are All right\nLike ville protest for you but they're not going to like help you with your back you know what I mean like [noise]\nAnd so it really started to love the people in Missouri and there were so kind and welcoming out for a while and the thing that I Love most about Missouri is Kansas City style barbecue [noise] yeah and you can see barbecue the best barbecue and the entire world and no place better than a place in a rural Missouri\nThis is a moth radio hour from the Iraq I'm Jennifer Hicks in\nOur next story was told in Sioux Falls where we partner with South Dakota public broadcasting the theme was big night at the orphans theater and our next story teller shared a story about her big night fears carry Adam live in South Dakota [noise]\n\nSo when I got married I was a D I why crafty crazy person from the minute I got engaged I became obsessed with the details of the wedding I thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but that we had perfect case to\nSo I dived into research I was looking up it takes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented and after all my deep dives I was ready to go they started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm now than an envelope with vintage stamps I picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp than I had to scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for funny friend ...\nI may have Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache if I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's letting them\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter]\nShe actually went with me that restores picking out all the Knicks snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelfth\nHe cared about to\nMostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful\nAn anthropology catalog threw up over everything but\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung out let the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise]\nI was\nActually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swan when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed\nNo one saw any of it\nNow luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these ... people\nSo we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up with a big town\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made that my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm are ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't give them a little cart I made so we just proceed without her\nUm [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some\nShowed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies amongst all of this the worst part for me\nWas that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and\nI had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called them and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should have been [noise] and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburgers spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm is finally passed\nI mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and the specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nFact it was our friends and the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day and they don't make the marriage either\nBecause I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix\nMaybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increased corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did\nHe missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend and a meatloaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo he missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean they're people who think they are a scam but I Love wedding\nI Love the details and stuff and\nI became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nIs if I ever get married again I'm totally going to elope\nThat would\nIn addition to being a wedding planner\nKerry also runs an online store called the plumb fields shop\nHer dream to be a magician assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carrying all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from Kerry sweating all the MTV Neal visit them off dot org I keep meaning to ask Carrie if she include karaoke led by pot roast as part of her standard wedding package\nThat would be a big seller I think\nNext up is Donna Autor we first met her at the mosque doors slammed in Portland, Oregon [noise]\nShe told this story at a show in Albuquerque New Mexico where we partner with public radio station K. A. N. W. fears Donna auditor\n[noise]\nFor about a year after Twenty one year marriage [noise] and I'm getting ready to go to a time trick body painting party [noise]\nThat sounds tomorrow's one day you're wrong KLW you can make your voice heard any time at one age voice mail inbox five five three six twelve twelve you can also email one day at W. W. dot org or tweet after\n\nMy partner he's just ahead of me on the end just suddenly I Know that if\nThe question that's been building up between us for months now I guess\nSilence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of hail Ian Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nOr this isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female [noise] um I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay\nMan trapped in a woman's body um and as I got older um that's literal feeling the feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise] um and then I met a transgender person\nAnd I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant\nThat um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did [noise] um [noise]\n\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay men in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started this thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right\nTime for me to get to be pregnant and so I was using the pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and it was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby and I'm Still but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I did it\nTo change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant but it actually ended up being okay and\nI think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this are my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just went into that and then I just let everything else go oh and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly um and I don't know about\nYou all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there's hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience in and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her knees too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster and then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that maybe would be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm\nActually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise]\nAnd and powerful but the truth is I started to lose hope\nFor our country and and for trans people that we would ever be loved in the way we deserve and all of those stories started to seep in one night I had a really horrible nightmare where I was giving birth not not to a baby but to a monster\nWith two heads and a forked tongue and the tail and I woke up and I was climbing shaking and this was like what's wrong with that I couldn't tell him all I could say it was the U.S [noise]\nAnd I didn't really know that before that that people hate us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
