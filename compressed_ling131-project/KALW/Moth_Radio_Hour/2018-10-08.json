I going to be\nAwful lot of financial always buy too much produce and always goes bad before I get a chance to cook it and it goes bad before I get a chance to cook it 'cause I don't cook at home 'cause I work late and produce is usually so expensive in New York you know I'm not finished with so cheap because it was so dirty and\nNext up the moth radio our true stories told before a live audience I'm Jennifer Hudson in this hour mistaken identity rains in formaldehyde and internal arguments [noise]\nIf it gets damp it's just going to go bad faster and I can't Washington drag 'cause I don't have a salad spinner helping her because I'm not married [noise]\nThat\nStory and more coming up next on them off radio hour from ...\n\nI'm ... and this is poetry now\nI find I'm off in writing poems for particular people and in this case it was both [laughter]\nIt was both the wanting to give something to a person who was struggling and also knowing you can't really do anything in that situation a poem doesn't mean upon helps and it doesn't help at all [noise] I wrote it fast on the train\nAfter seeing ...\nYou know thinking about a passage of time that\nThe train went underground and you come up and there's the sun again\nAnd the world the same but it's also\nPoem for jackass you were laughing no you weren't she was she was she wasn't these aren't the right words that people

thinking about how inadequate words are\nSometimes that's frustrating but more often than not I find that to be one of the most beautiful things about language the gap between how much we want it to mean and how little it can really accomplish in the end\nSo there's a lot of um stuttering in a way in this poem and it's not frustrated so much as just\nMay be speaking or helpless or looking for

going to hear some stories that have it on something noted millions of detailed proper path each day most are in consequential but sometimes our eyes real wide and we've euro in on a detail that changes everything\nHappened to our first story Taylor are Eric Thomas when he pulled focused on a small sign in a library\nOriginally told this story for us to his home town\nHere he is alive at the [noise]\n\nFirst time I went viral was in two thousand and two of you know what that means going viral slipping wherever we after I guess they mean to the article ah we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time I'm not having to leave\nThe Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nTelling you that the two I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activities I just\nOccasionally were right um movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly because I really like free things um\nThen we'll go home and I was a direct my parents' basement and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper um in their subscription complaints department I'm\nLiving [noise]\nAnd so people would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning I'm sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about a an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just called me because they were lonely um and so I Would go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus\nUm and then I Would go back home and that was my life\nSo I went viral in February um I was in the campus bookstore one afternoon I'm In February courses\nBlack history month until they had a display up for black history month that's faded from bondage to book\nAnd it had a picture of Harriet Tubman and the picture Colin Powell [noise]\nAnd that was bad\nAnd it looked up the side and I looked around the store like this [noise]\nAnd there was like nobody else in the store it's like look back\nAt the fine and I actually get heated\nAre staring at that time and I like to find the hurt my feelings um because it's said to me in those few words that are the history of black people or the history of my people in this country could be boiled down to the middle passage\nSlavery and whatever it is the Colin Powell means to you um [noise]\nWhich back then was complicated and now it's like interesting stuff [noise]\nFrom bondage to books you were a slave and now you can read congratulations [noise]\nI felt like I was in this like\nArguments with the spine that I was losing um [noise]\nAs I turned on my healing my lesson that I left I realized this time didn't have to have the last word so I walked across campus to the newspaper\nOffice because the campus newspaper office and I said I'm writing editorials and there were like I'm sure the movie review guy and I was like I've changed [noise]\nI wrote about the sign and I decided to frame it as a satire because I wanted to write about the idea behind the fine I'm as well as like my frustration about it and the sinus all through the whole thing um\nAnd I called it an idiots guy to black history month called Colin from bondage the books that have some type of\nAnd the effect the fans in ... um\nI don't know why I decided to write it as a satire I wasn't really sure what satire was to be honest I thought you just have to like really really sarcastically um\nAnd so that's what I did it begins like this it's a a another black history month has come and gone good riddance how long we pay for the penance of this country stands against black people and how much black history is there really we all know the drill slavery Middle Passage\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought\nIn Cantonese it means busy body curious\nAlways asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity acting all of those\nQuestions because when you're born a kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down\nLearn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was\nBorn and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which has bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother's a take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\nAnd so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China\nWho every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nAsk that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that\nIt's going to cause the rockets right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen\nI was so excited to watch a PBS documentary becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked\nAt like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought\nThe Japanese were stealing their job they fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people\nAre now saying if this happened to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I'd never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin\nHave I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face\nAnd there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask\nA murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent
