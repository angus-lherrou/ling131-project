second at this could lose but right now back on the program hockey ... welcome back to the folks that were good morning veteran good morning that song is is quite the wake up call it made me think of I think we were talking about some ... uh well as some um\nEmerson lake Palmer what what's going on in that song that were bouncing around to you what do you actually thinking about\nUm the the movie that the song was part of I think the early seventies [noise] um the theme of the movie was this older brother who's in search of his younger sister who's gone missing but really she's just having a big old party with a bunch of Indian hippie and they're getting high and\nThey're they're just you know\nThey they're singing about what we don't over the world and they think the world is an old was anything\nThe whole point of the song okay so it is as ... as it sounds or the ... this part of it the the original song has two parts where this is the sister seeing it saying I'm getting high I'm having a good time and the brother responds with this heavy religious\nRighteous judgmental no you need to be a good girl kind of a response which obviously we didn't cover right\nKeep it up right there you go now this is album number two in this exploration of fusing the blues and the songs of your youth\nMy you know that you are you in then Bombay than in Bombay now Mumbai you called the Lost Ark he goes to Bollywood this one or maybe a little more straight up Hindi man blue yeah is is the is it a little different or it's the same source where the\nFence on the same source that was a big overflow or with the last album I had so many songs I didn't even get time to consider\nAnd um since the release of that first all the money goes to Bollywood I had a few original song ideas in my head and I wanted a few songs to be a little more out there compared to the first one first one was really a a of an experiment but now that we had done it we had a better sense\nThat it worked and that there were some more possibilities out there so we did that and Trump is still president\nSo I had to call it can be round [laughter] he ... he was only a glimmer in your eyes and the first one [laughter]\nUm which just send me a minute with you perform at hardly strictly a couple of weeks ago yeah in full regalia I mean your own business I I have to I mean but this was not the case a few years ago no\nIt's not and um you know this this transformation kind of happened because I I think the changing climate kind of force my hand you know I was really trying to be a good good uh integrated immigrant [laughter] and and I saw what was happening over the last few years and I said this is not what I think that should be headed\nAnd if I have to represent myself to my art I have to be honest about everything that I Am and no more hiding\nNow hiding here one thing what about like you mentioned that the ACA goes to Bollywood was a little bit heretical for the the Bollywood plans back home\nYou know I haven't been back home I mean it's hard for me to like the rides breaking out and everything so I don't want to go there but uh uh from the feedback I've received here from the Indian community over here in the U.S in the bay area\nA ... it's been overwhelmingly positive I'm for one thing they're really happy to revisit these songs many of them are you know no longer played on the air or you know their favorites that they kind of forgot about [noise]\nDa\n\nDa da da da da\nDa da da\nDa da da da da\nDa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDa da da da da da da\nDa da\nDa\nDa\nDa\n\nDa da

very much what what made that one the first one that you tried\nIt was a eureka moment I mean really that's the song that go the whole thing go away but why that one uh I I Love that song I and the thing is the reason I sing the songs because I sing them at home\nOkay when I'm not doing anything else\nProductive which is all the time [laughter] so the songs on the part of my you know my mental or whatever make up ... they just\nCome out at the most to the strangest moments and and I'm I find myself harming them and singing them and that\nThat song a jeep just happened to be the first one
