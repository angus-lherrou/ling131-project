George I want to know the CD release party here in San Francisco next friday October twelve episodes and blues and George is here to tell us about the uptown cool a Charlie Bass playing guitar on that one who else have you got\nWell Ken Anderson was playing bass on that particular song he plays guitar on other songs\nWhen a kid is playing guitar joke Kyle on on base or who I'm sure you know now I'm Mike Horn players on the album Mike rent and Michael Palin when our fabulous players\nI'm Dee more on percussion on that particular song on I Want to know a Laura Lee christiansen doing background vocals on that song or\nCool great great people that that I Want to know how to sort of stands out on the album or with a lot and feel when I read that your last album was titled after a expression you heard from someone in Brazil that's correct washing my horse [laughter] where did the this one come from the time\nThis also comes from Brazil it comes from a song that some Brazilian friends introduced me to that I just loved it was by\nA to do at actually between two well known Brazilian women singers I'm ...\nAnd Angela ... uh and I I heard the song and I just thought it was fantastic and and wanted to figure out a way to transform it into one of my own songs and and so I\nSort of borrowed the feel and parts of the melody\nUh of course you know that that song was in Portuguese and and you know I I had to come up with completely a different theme and different lyrics and all of that right\nIn early in the year when the all of the news was breaking about Harvey Weinstein and all of the other sexual harasser you know my my initial thought was you know when I heard about them was to write a song\nThat started you know keep your flipping hands do yourself that that was kind of my first my first impulse\nBut then I thought you know what it ... instead of doing the electric or a critical song like that what if I did one that talked about what you might do if you were a person who want it to respect others ... how would you\nOperate in a situation where a relationship was changing from a friendship to a romance you know what what would be an appropriate way to act and you know a as they say on the playground these days use your words [laughter] I just kind of like you know you could always ask like I Want to know every last stand with you\nEverything I needed to know I learned in kindergarten yet [laughter] of now that tune being a little less a well outside the the blues format unless it's a little more maybe to the traumatic\n[noise] well yeah I think so I think so of course you know there are I call him wizards you know of the harmonica who can take a diet tonic are Monica and they can play anything any they can play any song I mean there aren't very many of the power to levy is probably the only one who can do this he could take\nAny heart in any key and play on any song with it because they've learned how to\nYou know get all of the crime addicts scale on a on a diet it's on a car but yes it's I I mean\nYou know that song actually really is kind of a ... comes from the song that's that's almost a Brazilian take on a tangle and the traumatic or might there there are people down in Argentina traumatic or Monica players who are\nFantastic uh players and it's and it's you know so yeah it's part of that idiom it's part of that a part of that scene already mhm so yes I I think it does fit on that song particularly well\nAnd the the player who was one of the biggest influences on you hold the Les Paul delay or did he ever played in a style like that [noise]\nI Know I Can't I Can't think of I mean I should probably never say never but I'm not aware of any song of his that ... that had that kind of flavor okay he was a musical genius though and he was an extremely a creative\nSongwriter a ... in in I mean not only like his lyrics were very interesting but his music was also very sophisticated in very interesting to\n'em and he was the first person I\nUh became conscious of using the traumatic in in more than one position right now I'm not saying that other people didn't do it but he's the one I first caught on to that uh and it was when I heard a song I picked up this harmonic\nOr do with what I've been listening to and I heard the song of his co why can't you love me and it slipped me out I'd never heard in blues I listen to jazz you know to steal men and other wonderful players in in the jazz\nA genre but I'd never heard anybody lives do anything like this and and he was playing in second position which is almost unheard of in a you know on ... in ...\nI'm so that was that was a kind of a ... a real turning point for me it's when it's like the lights went off and I thought oh my God there's there's\nSomething going on here that I've never never encountered before and it's very very cool so it's pulled away and you happen to have brought us to tune is that the one I get I sure did that once again why can't you love me all the way brought to here by uh I guess because George ... folk city was [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrong and why can't you know maybe\nSpring long long long\n[noise]\nYou're getting back to\n\nUm and uh I I think probably what moves me the most as a as a as a listener is voice ... Otis had a fabulous singing voice and and and\nI think you you know there's no accounting for why some voices grab you and others don't but his really grabbed me right and uh so\nYeah so next friday
