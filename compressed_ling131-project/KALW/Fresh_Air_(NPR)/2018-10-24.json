some money from oil and you and he become antagonists and in in one scene in Oregon here\nBasically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the
