the one point seven KLW San Francisco ill W. dot org your local public radio good morning I'm Kevin bands climates minus six [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross we're about to have perhaps the most important midterm election of our time the outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the twenty ten election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting\nAnd aggressive purging voters says twenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called you use it or lose a policy which removes people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act the current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering and I guess Ari Berman has been\nHe's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America he's a senior writer for Mother Jones reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talked state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented a new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote\nOr to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now and the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera\nWhere there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence had all this is happening\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nAfter the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states in twenty ten they began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot than those efforts were basically given a green light by\nThe Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nInstead of those states with the longest histories of discrimination\nNo longer had to approve their voting changes with the federal government that allowed states in the south that previously had to prove their voting changes with the federal government places like Texas and Georgia North Carolina in Alabama to implement these new restrictions on voting so I think you're seeing a national effort\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry\nI Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one vote and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally in twenty sixteen and if you compensates\nAnd not Hillary so what is called that do to prove that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally\nIn the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me\nThat he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nCritical back has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it used to draw districts for state legislatures it's used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach toad Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted\nWhen it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation in area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts\nTo only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation than places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift\nTo Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are gonna become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live\nWill get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise wouldn't affair and accurate census so where does that stand now there's question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high\nStates and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the centrist is unfair for such as is it accurate than so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights\nAnd we'll look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the

Confederate General Robert e leading\nStanley McChrystal on the mist and lesson of leaders next time on one hand\nYou can hear one at eleven o'clock this morning right after your call here on Ninety One point seven KLW time right now in local public radio is nine thirty\nWhere one point six million ex felons can't do that is a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida including one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against the term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only\nRestored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida during his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo\nIn the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as a Supreme Court is Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what's his position on voting rights\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he upheld a voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise\nI wrote the majority opinion upholding this law and he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court are ready this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the twenty Eighteen election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive and his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act to places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you met nationally and voting fry how pervasive hasn't been\nStudy shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches the signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in the state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have\nSure looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already and\nI Would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data\nIs that the number of people prevent it from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book
