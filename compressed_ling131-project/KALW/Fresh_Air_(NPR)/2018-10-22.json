rock 'cause I get a better response\nMost vetoed this [noise]\nThe only one without [laughter]\nThose McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on at this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic that are way\nBut I wouldn't call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you\n[noise] um I think it's in it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know\nPut all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh if you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the searching people at each performance joke [laughter] don't have much impact\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe ride on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing them you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't a point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like ... look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWith him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mother is really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended\nAnd it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human next\nAction hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting to do that and not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hear him say or you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he well he said to me was he called me or what language\nCatherine language me relay what they do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like your room and my legs and kick you out in a job with my phone\nJust scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I Will throw you out to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it and just go back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the first time a sitting with ... said for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory\nHedging improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the part of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character\nAt your very impressive detective and that\nAggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults that someone\nHopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest as Melissa McCarthy she stars in

it's the your call one planet series\nAnd we'll be talking to investigative reporter Antonia draws about her latest Pacific Standard cover story it's called death on the Dakota access it to look at the deadly business of building oil and gas pipelines turns out a recently those construction workers\nHave died many times more often than the average American worker so we'll talk about the dangers but those workers and how this industry is regulated so hope you'll join us for the one ... one planet series that's coming up\nAnd how much it's regular you know much it's not regulated branch right ... you were looking forward to the show ten o'clock this morning when a half hour from now from right now is nicer\nGay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\n... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my job off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is going crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop to\nOh I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what\nFirst of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\n[noise] and they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a fish is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times I saw\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I wouldn't flashes like ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explode it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nCertainly and other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good rules because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I've never mind it how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flood\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to sink your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness as\nCharacter was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all saying I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were outed for\nAssaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more\nEmpowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward all take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys\nThere has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need\nMoney for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nHelen Hogan threatening letter from election officials after registering people to vote and George\nAnd I got scared you know [noise] um and then test\nSo she got help if you want to go through to corral came to the right place shut out of the polls over the next ...\nYou can hear a veal today at twelve noon here in Ninety One point seven ...
