on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire but we shouldn't New York times reporting reveals a different narrative\nIt's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records\nGiven to the times by a secret source the documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud Suzanne ... and David Barstow or two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative\nI asked passes vast fortune onto his children does an crank writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president and his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSuzanne crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air attack your pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of is no frills homes that he was able to\nBuild very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAnd especially with the return of the GIs from World war two and a few would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to build middle class\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions is a defender of religious liberty but this support selective\nOr public face of this government which is very protective of religious liberty and then the real work that they're doing is only protecting religious liberty rights of those who are religious conservative\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly when the administration's views on religious liberty conflict with other priorities this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\n... consider three o'clock this afternoon here I Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco rush air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who report in just\nA couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and\nHow they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time it was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million I'm In today's dollars which two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to dawn what we what we also saw ... what is important also is the ... in many cases um these were loans that were never repaired him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run into\nTwo for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase those Donald Trump took on\nAnd she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to raise these were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to the father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ends up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nCould also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was that a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will sexually and knew well and the Scottish filter the wheel it's taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety and Fred Trump immediately sees\nThis caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and ...\nImmediately says no he freaked out and he\nMakes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald list the soil executor fried Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is drafted but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt to bring his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use the the the empire that for Trump\nThe director jj ... or ... potentially does collateral to help build Donald Trump or his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow ensues and crab after a break

R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings who made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nAvoid or their taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor their looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mock of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when he actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of Kevin himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he's just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of the\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the you know hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from fat trap and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene from Trump belt and paid for [noise]\nYou have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nThan that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken that I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who was allowed to go [laughter] we uh we\nDid not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and\n[laughter] it but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with ah yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't I was a little ...\nAnd it'll cost her phobic too I Would imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um\nActually if people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it says and Craig David Barstow thank you so much\n... thank you Suzanne ... and David Barstow reporters for the New York times article reported with Russ Buettner\nThe suspect tax schemes used a transfer of wealth from red Trump to his children was published earlier this month in the New York times magazine coming up can tackle reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas at the concert whereas shooter opened fire on the audience is is fresh air", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
