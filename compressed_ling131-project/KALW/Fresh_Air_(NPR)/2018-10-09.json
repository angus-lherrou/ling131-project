[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross\nThe New York times just reported that in twenty sixteen Rick Gates then deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump\nRequested proposals from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation helped defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton and the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective use of Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nOur country is hardly the only one in which political opinions have been manipulated by millions of fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up our guest today pi Wu singer and Emerson working say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of\nLike fueling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaigns\nFor instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing\nA consultant for the U.S military and intelligence community and the author of several books Emerson T Brookings writes about conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations\nEspecially as Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWell Peter Singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air\nYou know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive is was the German invasion of France what happened\n[noise] so you had this new technology that are connected\nEverything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communication and\nRadio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of not ism goals are said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and it's sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of the things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figure it out really radio was what a cause all cause of the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation it's surprise invasion of Iraq that allowed it to defeat a force that was a multiple times bigger it's part of these ways to social media is in effect change the world\nAnd their job uh and it it hasn't soon training programs and I credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations ... W singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\n...\n... ... or ... or\n\n\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking\nWith the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this what\nDid they do so it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nIn twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered than a boss would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region and this was an example\nFor public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nA centrally they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a ineffective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing the battle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving and one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel has done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlisted and online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can list and Taylor Swift or army of ... you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nWould port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion\nISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson working authors of the new book

is fresh air and we're speaking with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your ... feet during the Kavanaugh hearings\nIn many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where are they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nIt wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh\nToo I unpack this strange story of a two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate Bush you know all sorts of different false stories\nTheir own narrative went out and the other side the narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempt to change not just your point of view but history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we compete ya\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that it was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he said no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on wicked PT or do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections and the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are\nWhere this all came from and now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a are battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce\nThe picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of committed something\nTo get real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
