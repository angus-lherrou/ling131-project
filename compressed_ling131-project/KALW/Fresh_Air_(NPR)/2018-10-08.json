Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert anti attacking him on our shallow and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed a father in two thousand six after the publication of a book of his bones and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the plane so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nI used to be your favorite\nDrunk good for one more laugh\nThat we both ran out of luck unlock was all we had\nYou put on the uniform to fight the civil war\nI tried to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for so let's drink too when it's over and let's drank too when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they are used to be a street\nIt wasn't all that easy when you up and walked away\nBut all the that little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens have videos you we'll it through the night the guru says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's lived\nSo that strength to when it's over unless the strength to when we meet all be standing on this corner where they're used to be a street\nYou left me with the dishes and a baby in the bath\nAnd you're tied with the militias\nAre where their their camera flash well I guess that makes us equal but I Want to march with you or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's bring to when it's over unless drank too when we meet\nYou know like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspelled tracks during the subjects because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate him things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to it\nThan to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\nWho what when where why they're the five W's around the corner of every story but without context story is incomplete all things considered gives you the texture dialogue and analysis you need to make sense of the news here the bigger picture every afternoon [noise]\nYou can you hear all things considered Monday through friday from three to five PM you're on Ninety One point seven KLW time right now is nine Twenty one\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to\nUm to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter\nFor me to read them I appreciate you saying that his son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there's so many performers who left performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so\nI go anytime they want to get on record as saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing to this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my metered with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to say I'm not being ... can tankers or intransigent\nNo it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another promising is\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a monk I shaved my head and war robes and got up very early ages everyone but I acted generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly through the ten thousand nights I spent a loan\nFrom a third storey window above the park deport you gal I've watched the snow come down all day as usual there's no one here they're never is\nMercifully the inter conversation is canceled by the white noise of winter I Am neither the mind the intellect nor the silent voice within that's also castles\nAnd now the gentle reader in what name in whose name do you come to Idaho with me in these luxurious and twins laying realms of aimless privacy\nThink that home and um get so little about what you were talking about the connection of your father riding in solitude and the reader re reading alone and\nYeah as you noted also kind of humor you know half of the river a loved one of his lungs where he\nSays a few good men to love you could did slick the tour away my blindfold and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] I used to do so there is\nMy guest is Adam Cohen he's written a forward to a new collection of previously unpublished writings and drawings by his

Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burn a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire\nI'm so did you hear him or he didn't he didn't believe me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies\nThere was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scrapped it and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd then we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and I was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid an amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that\nBaton off the ground you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember so how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nFeed always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise] oh yeah they are like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nMhm yeah I remember my mother\nMoved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things and put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nAnd they said something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for um he's reconnection to people um I ... around them\nIs it like drain your father's savings and so all the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like skin cells to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transnational and\nUm and like I think your sister who discovered that it happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry and incredible [laughter]\nTo the canon of his work with his devotion to black cutting pages and bell that he did he built the life he built for himself\nAnd um when you experienced this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what it was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and [noise] um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life oh essay festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching his works I'm studying is works or even [noise]\nA whole rabbinical clan adopting his
