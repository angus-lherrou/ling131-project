R. G. your local public radio good morning I'm Kevin Vance fresh air continues at nine oh six [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation raise the question again how do we decide who to believe when a woman says she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the men denies it\nThat's an issue of universities have been grappling with\nMy guest finesse of gory artists is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight first on campus and\nThen nationwide with me too movement gory out as as a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nMonastic regarding artist welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it spread beyond camp\nAsian tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee\nHad gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by the Republicans on judiciary were men\nA lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah if those senators had I'm Ben on college campuses as presidents or administrators or title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is\nVery few women make it up very few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors and don't actually report for awhile\nAnd they wouldn't know that they might not actually get a lot of evidence because there is very rarely good evidence and many of these cases particularly those that happened thirty six years ago so they have to look at the credibility of each percent [noise] last\nTuesday while the FBI investigation we're still going on\nInto Brett Kavanaugh President Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House before boarding a flight theirs was October second and so this this was before the Senate voted on the Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court before they confirmed him so this is President Trump\nWhile I was very scary for young men in America where did you uh you'll see of jumping but you may not be guilty of which is a very very ... very just a little ...\nPicture every afternoon you can hear all things considered weekdays from three to five PM including sights and sounds on Thursdays and the school lunch menu only here in Ninety One point seven KLW for sure continues no nine twenty\nLet's get back to my interview with the ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing\nWhat what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of in\nThe three years you were talking to people on college campuses there was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration 'em by the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you\nA grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now it's a yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable and their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at us in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question\nSo why were you resistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sects usually happens means sex is something that is an ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people not to part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um they really have to be an extra question ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness one you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they end up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get how\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise]\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes you like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little dorky\nOkay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and down with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said\nNo [laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happened here\nThat was definitely the first time in fact it up for it to be I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and\nI'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great thing to how that happened and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know are in night clubs or\nOwn at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa grew
