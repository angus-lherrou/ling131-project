Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers ah you know everywhere expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and um you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work around those plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the at the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and ah he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant

um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under ... [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time\nAh you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist though he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men just kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get them to have them if they allow sort of cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy a adult life but if you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so\nThere's that dichotomy and his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a skips from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting out in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slid the slave economy\nYeah exactly I think that some pitch for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in my ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nAnd he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place in in in the world but he's not really thinking about the fact that\nYou know for all of his scientific pursuits this is being funded by slavery or and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and so he's profoundly affected by it because he wouldn't be able to do what he does a without that a dark commerce going on [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "15"}
