their showing a movie\nThan Vincent Price in a scene from the Tingler directed by William Castle\nCastle low budget shocking height made him a hero to today's guest screenwriter and director John Waters waters started his own filmmaking career setting new lows in bad taste most notably with the cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical\nWas he used to watch in Baltimore last Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPainting play for the first dirty book I ever read I Love grey metallic\nOr is it I've never read the book\nThe Wii of Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter] I Know that dirty\nBut uh in Nineteen fifty sex that was pretty dirty\nAnd oh it's a great you want to read Peyton place there isn't any sequels to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for\nA [laughter] a grey metallic has that famous author shot of her on the lumberjack out in the dirty ponytail sitting at the typewriter and I was so obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book\nBut painting plays itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut whenever they got to a sexual scene they would cut\nShort cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake where if somebody was getting turned on and they show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shop and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but actually it's dirty shots of what they couldn't show them\n[noise] since you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interesting things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other dimension to think of what I might as well play it up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising and no one knew it was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like ... it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy's how she pronounces it um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven understand I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines where there were many off at the time [noise]\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version that we have the sufferer we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is scored to classical music where there's one note that as the gunshot and divine crawls over the car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive like that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white uh\nA sixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the ... film them one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever\nPiece based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the art world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was too big for one wall to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine when this film that you're referring to play a Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know a very heavy man who who usually played a woman in your movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd I'm like what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWell they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot Hepburn they all want it to be best Myers and\n\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't hep ever now all drag queens or hip I mean you're saying that when stock and they're all really funny in a sense of humor and they have funny names everything but but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contests\nIn Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and a very very famous a drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorists which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\nNo early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness\nNormal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so what he said that was the ... thing I've ever said I didn't mean to be the nominee\nI Believe that the most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fed there in a famous America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in show business to complain about\nAny of that kind of thing but what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to\nRecognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that that we base our life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there's a lot of skills of movies and I'm not to stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter] you\nAlso have to rush failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clown from howdy Doody [laughter] not not known as the most but okay next Arab bell yes\nHe was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery at NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honked of one and shot you in the face with seltzer water 'em and you know captain kangaroo and clear about what the same person imagined that life\nI I think ... was um a frightening and the best sense of the word it was the first psychotic person I remember from my childhood his character\n... played clarinet yes if I knew that I was a couple of ... you know if he was he was the first clerical huh was that your first\nBrush 'em let's let's let's be real show business being in the peanut gallery of that duty\nWherever and be disillusioned child I was in on the secret and I wanted to stay on it\nSo you did public shows as a kid\nYeah for a long time what kind of care hand puppets and I did Cinderella and then later punch and Judy but at the end I Would come out from behind the stage which is like breaking referred Raul puppetry and said of the kids you know stick out your hammer dragon puppet will bite it for good luck\nThree fourths of the kids cheered and they loved one girl ... of the rest of them have nervous breakdown started sobbing and this is basically what I still do

which was titled role models\nUm let's get to somebody else in the book and this is ray ... Howard Cooper thank you [laughter] and he's a he's a designer yeah she's a designer who who was not known to me\nFirst Japanese fashioned liberal for deconstructed fashion um she's been around quite some time hugely successful in Japan\nOkay you you you described your luck as disaster at the dry cleaners [laughter]\nYeah I like her clothes she always has something no matter whether it's something of that so I I Love the idea when you spend more money than your shirt on an outfit for fashion no one thinks she spent money they think you got it for a nickel somewhere in the thrift shop but actually centered on purpose it's like getting dressed in reverse\nIts sneaky fashion it's wearing outfits that you liked that regular people just think it's something the matter with it and you've got a bad code on\nI mean I'm I see people on the street that are homeless and actually look like outfits that I've played a lot of money for it [laughter] and um I find that ... I I find it to life and my father used to that you bought that something that they saw you come in boy but they did see me come [laughter]\nI was eager to get it okay this is far too personal yum [laughter] so I'll Try it anyway [noise] um do you like costume name when it comes to actual fact\nNo you mean to someone have to be in a certain outfit no I'm not out specific thank God but what somebody has on I always really think that if boys turn their belt halfway to the right one for the buckle is in on the side Marlon Brando did that's ... ... it's a lot of confidence I like\nI like somebody that pulls often effort look look but no I don't have to have somebody dresses airline\nPilots for a guy and I know that I Would start laughing I was the only way I was there something that's inherently absurd it's ...\nEveryone sex life is funny except your own uh-huh\n[laughter] really every ... years and years and never it\nOne way and that well because\nThe lengths that people go to the extremes and the conditions and the mental exercises and guilt and shame and happiness that everybody goes from what they'll do for sex is if it's never ending in mind boggling and very interesting to me and um and I don't think a lot of times people choose any of it\nI I I'm a friend of mine I ... I think I have it in this book where um her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's the community and I said well ask them to people forget if they're gay or straight and the workers had never once they don't know who their family is I don't want anybody but no one suddenly doesn't remember if they're gay or straight\nWell doesn't that prove really but you're born that right\nOkay so I Want to call it something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you and what a sobering welcome smack in the face that statement was yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet accredited funeral\nIsn't everybody in show business on the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field that were strangers have to tell them they're good for the rest of their life\nI figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great thing to shrink for that I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk about the things that make you the most uncomfortable but I'm paying for this let's get my money's worth so I used to after that going to think of the things that maybe the most up to like to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking to her you know Freud said the best thing ever a red line that's I think so Britain is turning hysterical misery and to comment on happiness what a great great line\nBut I find that such a paradox and let you spelled out there that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and in a career and yet he tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life as a campaign for popularity isn't that a parent I\nI think it's probably being a healthy neurotic everything that I'm running on the news\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and in show business certainly it is a it is or politics with all the same thing you have to get people to like you\nI'm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that at a crowded funeral is a nice thing I like that but the older you get the less chance of has of happening not another reason to make younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like the Oscars when somebody goes to the bathroom to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want families [laughter]\n[noise] you know because as as you've said you've made a living selling shock uh will surprise surprise yeah and and some of your senses the addition of your early ... I think I mean I'd have some very\nLike vile we you know repulsive thinking people and I'm ... [laughter]\nI don't agree but OK okay there were there were\nCertainly using anarchy to get their point across and they were rebelling against I'm very particular worlds retirement lusting after things that are um maybe you shouldn't but um I think the morals and all my film for were quite obvious I'm a good guy won and every one of the movies\n[noise] nevertheless I think people are really surprised\nBy how it just kind of like nice and funny and easy to talk to you are like earlier in your career before ... before the ... there was as public of John Waters as there is no I think people thought that you would be this really peculiar person who might I'm\nReally traffic and sales and and the old days ...\nDays in town but marijuana on my car form of CDs for you know I don't want to have a\nYeah I think in the beginning but I think through reading books maybe more and more my public speaking and stuff is it they realize that I'm not the characters I think but no director is usually not that many Stephen King are out there and Valerie why did they think I Would [noise] [noise]\nWell I I Want to thank you so much for talking with us and it was really great to talk with you well thank you very much sir\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross twenty ten the Baltimore museum of art has just opened a major retrospective of is visual art and published a hefty companion volume those they're called John Waters indecent exposure and the exhibition runs through January six\nComing up I review the Roman us the new TV series from Matt Weiner the creator of Mad Men this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nFresh air on local public radio KLW where nearly three quarters of the financial support comes from you dear listener and you Janice in our eldest Cupertino Susan shepherd and Charles ...
