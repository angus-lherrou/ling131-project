cultural front wanting\nTo join us for that fresh air is coming up next time it was nine ... [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross the federal government under President Trump is the subject of the new book this this risk by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany a central positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest or political views that make them antagonistic\nAbout this in articles published in Vanity Fair\nGreg Miller welcome to fresh ... is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um stories are obviously many stories of the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved in include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a a a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was about was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nLooks it looks like we're having a technical problem there and we played there on tape so we are now going to hear my interview with Michael Lewis sorry about that Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain my fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine if is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who tried to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department work to have found that he was really utterly disinterested in anything but trade so\nEven if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure is finances they put them in a bad odor with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if he was very odd choice because with that department really ... if someone who's really comfortable with technology [noise]\nWell if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise] alright midterms are upon us and even though they don't generate hype of the presidential election they should your local election could affect the rest of the country turned to all things considered for your local and national his term you hear\nThe bigger picture every afternoon on all things considered weekdays from three to five pm with Sandy breweries disconnect from Kolkata on Wednesdays and mind mix tape on Fridays only here on Ninety One point seven KLW time now nine twenty to\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAmong them there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a true we've had a prize the bigger cited it we don't say doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and score and it's collected rust and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nNo he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they're all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done when positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth we ask the kind of prime includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's for sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service ... at the national weather services a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off\nAnd just shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eat most of the resources and it and what it does\nUm is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it and\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better uh all of that saves lives in ...\nWeather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right to advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIf the the ... the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSince the Nineteen seventies the conservative movement has been working to take the carts from liberals and they've been wildly successful so how do they pull it off unlike liberal and progressive conservative had set aside their ideological differences to embrace a long term strategy\nFrom the Christian right to the federalist society they've managed to pack the carts with conservative judges what can be done to take back the courts joined an extra ... with me read that kids are and you\nComing up and a half an hour urine Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco killed at ... dot org your local public radio the time I was nine thirty [noise]\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise] one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poisons the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely\nThe risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of interest you showed you that people don't really feel this and that insight is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question\nWhat is the question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next well I I Know that's not really your job but no it's not my job but you know if I ...\nI Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds as causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risks now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalize and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold\nThe debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you treat the financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ...\nWhere they happened they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming [noise]\nMy guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nIt was not abound in college behavior and I think that is an important distinction that is what bothers people the degree to which Brett is not
