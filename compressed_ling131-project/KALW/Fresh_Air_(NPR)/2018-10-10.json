NASA and around the world just after the Apollo eleven lunar module commanded by Neil Armstrong became the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon moments later Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon and said these now famous words\n[noise]\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today and\nThat makes us successful moon landing even more remarkable I guess ... directed the new movie first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and\nTook incredible risks to test new space crafts and fly to

planning on that flight means successful ah [noise] I I just know how you feel about being a part of history\nI think I could shed some light here\nThe responsibility but it's exciting to be the

[noise]\nNeal when you take anything\nA fan of choices they\nGave me and says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the Maddox terrain at least two\nWhiplash in la la land and and ah but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and treating you know the sort of journey from\nQuite violently if we needed them to uh and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see often that you look out the window you see the face of a jury instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are stimulating the sun so you'd get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more ... you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight still uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it\nLooks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary impatient and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up\nTo the question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because ah he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it what did we ain't getting ... from ... we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second because rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nI'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy kind of noise making machinery\nSort of you know uh this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we serve would augment the sound you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them but this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the death of a man on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGiven Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent of that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nLived their lives and and being willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know something that families are all over the country and all over the world conversations that they sometimes have to have\nA any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people of\nMy guest is game inches down he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and we'll ... we'll

[noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is a music he actually brought with him to play after the space mining in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah\nSo it's it's a ... piece\nI find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into the category about an agenda that's been described as exotic I\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect you Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood staff celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being a fleet of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that uh that Neal is with the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI said well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOh wow\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThat's Linda Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and into used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man\nShooting it right yeah I I first\nMet Ryan uh to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you as a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real ... and then miniatures it it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in the camera work and that dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I uh I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know as it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself in all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned al thank you so much for attacking us it's been great to have you back on ... congratulations and thank you so nice to be back thanks
