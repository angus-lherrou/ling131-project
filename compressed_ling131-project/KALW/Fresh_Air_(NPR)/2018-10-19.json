the story is based on\nBeautiful boy is the name of the memoir journalist David Sheff wrote in two thousand eight about the struggles of his son Nick Nick who was twenty five in two years sober at the time had written his own memoir called tweak growing\nUp on methamphetamines Terry spoke to them both in two thousand date into David Sheff again five years later when he'd written another book about medical and scientific research into addiction and recovery called clean\nWere happy to report Nick is drug free today he's married and has written two novels and scripts for to television shows he and his father attended the premier of beautiful boy in Los Angeles last week\nLet's see we're seeing from a new film Nick played by Timothy showing me has disappeared for a bit and called his dad telling them a sober and asking to meet him for lunch his father David is played by Steve ...\nWhen I was carrying a\nThere's a lot of guilt trip right now I'm just saying you'll sampled on myself\nI Know they wanted you to be there that's all [noise]\nI'm Sorry I'm\nI she's very\nSo please skin money\nWhere does this and this is talk us through this we're going to ask me right now I got some good look like it's working out and do this looks like it's working out what the therapy how you can come home you know that when you get work please Nick [noise]\nI've been doing some research and do research she got to help to me that\nYou think that you have this under control\nAnd I ...\nI understand why do things and it's made me any difference alright I'm attract craziness and you're just embarrassed\n'cause I was like you know this amazing thing that you're special ... or something and you don't like why am now who are you near the day here this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of terrorists interviews with chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with the question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how your son's personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nYou know this coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed here he lost your skin and bones and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being fed this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nNick was misused rather preference like when you started using it what did he do for you that that made you want more\nWell I mean with all drugs I sort of had this feeling but yeah with math particularly with like I've always been I'm\nYou have to I too felt guilty when you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for\nThat too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be with a higher power and things like that it was an ethnic would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time which is ... ... but he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door [noise]\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lotta time you know trying so hard to practice prayer and\nDoing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe and ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthier and sober and to stop using the first thing that they're told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you mean about the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that but I mean you know that's what he says that that those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of it but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and grieve them enough for the first time really allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\nI learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is a it's\nSomeone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me about all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through\n... what does family mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to pray I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and just focus on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction was such a degree in South knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think one thing we had in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know ... I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily you know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I\nI think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after they\nUh Nick tells a story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this\nWe haven't seen that for a long time in in ... you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on a family vacation and it's and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and you talk to the kids about what they've been going on and was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that was I think it was just so meaningful to them and to Karen and to me and we had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed [laughter] and you talked about how he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh and that's what's going on here I'm sending my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child or going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... and ... and then all of a sudden he said that he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back in the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said\nWhat just happened he says another time in my life that moment would have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent there but it ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then\nSome math and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... can you know you get a good luck with some you know with continuing getting everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much thank you Terry thanks Terry\nNick chefs memoir about his struggled with addiction is titled tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called the beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie starring Steve ...\nSpoke with him in two thousand date David shepherd turned a fresh air five years later to talk about what he'd learned about the science of addiction and recovery will hear that interview after a short break\nAnd movie critic Justin ... will review the new Melissa McCarthy film can you ever forgive me\nWhen the baby's emphasis fresh [noise]\nNear our family foundation supports WHYY stretch hair and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this fiction\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere\nCapital one what's in your wallet capital one NA\nAnd from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform was over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more it go to meeting dot com\nThe second half of fresh air is just ahead here on KLW it's followed a ten by the friday media round table with your host Rosie I give our for your call\nToday more on the coverage of the killing of Washington Post columnist Jim all the ... the mounting evidence does point to the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is role and gruesome killing in the ... disappearance ... grows we'll also talk about the deep ties between Donald Trump\nAnd pro Israel Republican mega donor\nSheldon Adelson he gave twenty million to Trump's campaign and the nutritional five million for the inaugural festivities\nThat and more on the friday media round table in the tent if you can't catch the live\nConversation and joined in will catch the rebroadcast this afternoon it five war subscribed to the your called podcast by going to K.

brought him home\nAnd John everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose and died\nIf I got him home at least it would have been off the streets and I may have been able to get him back in treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out there\nWere listening to an interview with journalist David Sheff to re grow spoke with him in two thousand Thirteen about his book clean which focuses on research into addiction and recovery we'll hear more after a break this is fresh air\n[noise] [noise]

with the runoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John Slattery Amanda Pete all riser and Katherine high on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nThis is fresh air let's get back to tear each interview with David Sheff his book clean is about the medical science of addiction and recovery his earlier book beautiful boy about his son Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve Carell\nIf your child under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment\nUm he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he would be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do\nWhat were the other way\nWell sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to get off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know Dr either a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but that things went forward I mean the last time that relapse you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us and soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the Higgs field and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatment before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early\nAnd if you can you know you've made so much progress ... one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got on that plane that day I saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does\n[noise] so let's talk a little bit of that twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program is probably going to you know a ... step program for parents Elena yeah yeah\nAnd then you visited them just as we search for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nToo I think most people know like a positive\nOr parts of the what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's lonely many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places\nWouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative but I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people telling me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got al ... I Would sort of roll my eyes and think I Am not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into whether those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to you know put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as in I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\n[noise] we spend on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK to the aid if it's not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as press makes us all update on his life that's not ...\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great country what can I say he's he's an unbelievable person I've been out of his dad and so I I I'd prejudice but he\nHit extraordinary has just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know with kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gotten into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade\nHe's writing like mad he just had a novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if they're lucky I'm I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nYou have a chest thank you so much for talking with us and I'm the semi best regards to your son Nick I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and and I'm so glad he's um he's doing well thank you thank you very much I've Terry thank you so much\nDavid Sheff speaking with Terry Gross in two thousand Thirteen the new film beautiful boy is based on two memoirs one written by David Sheff and the other by his son Nick chef about Knicks addiction to mess and the subsequent recovery\nWere happened to update that Nick is drug free today he's married and has written two novels meant scripts for to television shows", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
