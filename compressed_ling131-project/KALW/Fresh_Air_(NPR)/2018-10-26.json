he played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol\nWas part of Warhol seen well many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist but he also wrote songs that had a spiritual quality\nTo

with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nI [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony the Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Lou Reed um are you so much for pleasure bigger so let's start with that song which thumbs up so much about what may made Lou Reed different from other music\nUh being made a at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only the reach career but into the larger music of that time\nIt's I'm such a daring statement you know certainly was recorded in Nineteen sixty father came out in Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nAnd they were mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was on like fluid and has actually yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's uh uh describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise]\nYes I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when he left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am a price on Iran I ... yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap Andrew saying a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever have given him money that she said of course he was giving them money\nYou know if it's anything for you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever loot needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat said he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending transgression of is that [laughter] totally\nDon't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me um you know I think it's\n... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car driving back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they had that kind of relationship that was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt him and he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names there was never like mom and dad um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know got along with them fairly well [noise] so early\nIn the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for an lead\nWell that's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know it sounds like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know I'm an artist who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking\nSo they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could\nYou know um she only saying you know a few songs a band with pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he technique on the band as well\nAfter having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time you know not\nA you know not art critics writing about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who you know having heard them yet you know and hurt I'll amazing they are so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think Lou felt All right\nAre you just needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way or the world was you know a rock and roll manager of\nYou know any note my guess is Anthony the Curtis the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break\nWe'll talk about ... relationship with women including his wives and as trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about ...\n\nCame from Miami in ...\nFitch heights away from us they plugged ... rounds on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the the\n... that have on a single woman ...\n\nStanding came from\nThat is Lou Reed walk on the wild side from his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head for that\nHe wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band and have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know [laughter] somewhat more going to go to Adam ... yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um\nEthics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lie in high school but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record\n'em [noise] so you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed is standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just\nYou know death and ain't guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it and I'm\nLike I never wanted he wanted to have his music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance exactly\nAnd it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm\n[noise] um so I'm ... ... you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise] um\nWell one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hospital apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview again at that time you know said\nNo that was real she did that I mean essentially saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got\nAnd um [noise] and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different ... of St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost half setting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing\nUm so ... there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassled you want to say anything about this that part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or as an thought to be kind of better which hit by a car I mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was the idea died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they got dragged out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if you had you know having an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his ... to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it it's just ... [noise]\nYou know in Libya weaving in and it really wasn't nice jogging and I really wish that there was a good time to speak\nBut you know a good leader has we're trying to please vote that was her all the guys in it's not like we did there was no one can do and it was the main you know I Would have been ... women's Nunes or Internet within the universe June agent\nThe way that is really some ... we're going to be moved around the girl\nWorse than it says I don't have to choose a woman and I knew his name to win a treaty is\nMind your brand new ... wedding range is around ... by mornings you know the Iran\nYou knew people that know what show it can never mind the\nThat they even colder\nReason think that they see that level than the right to be one moment no it's cool man", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
