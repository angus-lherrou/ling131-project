period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders the film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film is told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ... who wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires the take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts and spend the rest of their time\nBy pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections Jonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding is so sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness\nI dunno just made an impression on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\n... than the skaters of that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard are but\nYou know and yet ... okay and\nI loved it and it was there was this bombastic personalities such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on it having written this film he really\nShowed me you know a lot of what I think was great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn what or something and you\nFelt you had to learn from the culture\nThe way people spoke to one another and what they said to one another especially in regards to homophobia and toxic masculinity\nA member of stars aren't have scars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learning some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nI landed a kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties\nWe'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in after the break this is fresh air I\n[noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nSo she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don no excuse me she's Michael\nSallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLewis Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was funny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine the on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so ... you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange well\nKids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kid was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who I skateboard way of who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what chicken also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy show so hard to watch it as an adult\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nI guess just Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a

most of these laws have been put in place by Republicans\nAnd two thousand Florida Republicans purged fifty eight thousand felons from voting rolls a legit felons and since then voter suppression has

ROSAT you are\nYou started playing more dramatic roles you know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you are interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I Love and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ...\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir Moneyball\nAnd then in the interim ah\nI continue to do some comedy films that\nWere funny and fun and then uh I had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um I knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really watch so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is\nAs a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemons younger people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we hear\nA scene from a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nWritten by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill forward who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in\nPenny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard\nBy Donny aids off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\nSchool for ... for little kids right ... [laughter]\nWhat do you do [noise]\nGerms furniture so you saw right [noise]\nYou know do a rare for myself I'm trying to put it together in my car I live in the same build on just I'm not\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nSeventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious [laughter] and I'm sure as to\nHow much worse [noise]\nFor told you so many thousand technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nYou show me patience for Seventy two thousand dollars on I quit my job right now and I worked for your [noise]\nGoing to find a list and I quit\nAnd he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met this\n... there were other things about him to like his phosphorus white T life I got to deal with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just look more ...\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of law stream\nJust honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often\nDo really ugly things\nAnd you still find humanity and then\nAnd I like\nHow unabashedly and unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse which is\nSomething you've tried to do in your new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we didn't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our country\nHas a terrible father ... I read it terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also is very loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's wicker step mother\nAt a Benny hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're\nDirected at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nAnd beyond the drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria and Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe you don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was shocked lighted name check you on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment I was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first I'm this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Andy Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there\nAnd a bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in clocked his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known health thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you\nThank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties after we take a short break marine card and we'll review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American who was murdered in Mississippi in Nineteen fifty\nFive the outrage that followed became a catalyst in the civil rights movement this is Russia\nAlright midterms are upon us and even though they don't generate the height of the presidential election they should your local elections could affect the rest of the country turned to all things considered for your local and national mid term news here the bigger picture every afternoon\nAll things considered weekdays from three to five pm followed by cross currents Monday through Thursday only here on the one point seven KLW we would like to think the local businesses which provided sustenance for our volunteers during a recent membership Dr", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
