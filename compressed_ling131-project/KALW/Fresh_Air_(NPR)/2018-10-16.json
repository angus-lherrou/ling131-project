'cause Oscar was about to turn three when his grandparents insisted on taking legal custody of him because of his mother's heroin addiction and related problems that prevented her from taking care of him she was in and out of rehab with a student in prison while he was growing up\nThe book is written from the point of view as a Seventeen year old self looking back on his childhood and teenage years\nBecause I still wasn't an athletic boy wasn't good at socializing so drawing lessons refuge his way of making friends and his way of dealing with life\nBecause Africa is also known for his series of graphic novels for young people including lunch lady and the ... police squads series as well as the arts and the star wars jet I academies\nIt ... and his official author name as a tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph\n... ask a welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national book\nAward Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] so did you\nCome out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting make that they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share the story more widely\nThat people must have asked you like kids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising humor as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe that's my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nReally a mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are they'll I'm an adult and I really liked it I I Would recommend this to adults but um why did you want to like target AT T on into\nNo [laughter] at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school in Philly [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men\nYou know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans\nThis movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience\nTo the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer that yeah he was well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday on my wedding shower was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her notes oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the host and explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mind\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother\nLeslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she she drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\n[noise] you know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field\nAnd on the outskirts of this field you know where they're there's force and these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters and so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around\nThose other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there are there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares\n[noise] probably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same schools and building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of and um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now in them open about that to help a distant ties seeing someone who's talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected to do your teacher saying\nOh this is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learn\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as as an educator of the art and specifically he's teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally at and in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style a nation develop that he did say that and what did you learn anything\nFrom the how to draw like marvel comics with that though it was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] donating you ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hey kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family

me to bring my kids around here and I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested um and then get a recipe for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving
