them in ... in our kitchen faucet to them and when they grow hard shell the show material record some of the water quality with time says one of the leaders of study like tree rings you can count back the seasons and the years and their shell\nAnd get a good idea of the quality and chemical composition of the water during specific periods of time or the way back in twenty eleven it was discovered that despite treatment water and sediment downstream from fracking wastewater disposal size still contained fracking chemicals\nAnd had become radioactive so disposal in that special way [noise] intern drinking water was contaminated and aquatic life such as the freshwater muscle was dying\nSo Pennsylvania requested that wastewater treatment plant not treat and release water from fracking
