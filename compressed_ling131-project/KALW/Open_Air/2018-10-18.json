I mean we could spend an hour on the educational system of this country's still just astonishing to me that you know you think of you know you you you had your education in the United states now you had your education in ... fifty different states that have entirely different educational standards for their children yeah going up yes\nAbsolutely well there's an interesting educational element in the play the S. S. general that you referenced\nUm provides a disquieting civics history lesson to the audience in one of the more provocative elements in the play he remind the audience\nUm how America's Jim Crow laws provided a model for the Nazi lawyers drafting the Nuremberg Laws\nWhich provided which proved to be the foundation for the final solution\nAnd ultimately the extermination of six million European Jews\nTo the United states and this isn't something that we're taught in school the role that we played a in providing that model there was an interesting book that just came out which I Want to mention too deeply into your your listeners by James Whitman is a Yale professor it's called Hitler's American model extensively research into and goes\nInto those are the particulars of how that\nWill then we can go spend another hour or an IBM and Texaco and all kinds of chase Manhattan standard earlier Jersey yeah things that are we just had blinders on about yeah yeah\nSo I mean the obligation where that word comes from a why I've chosen as as a as the title of the play has a lot to do it again the history that my mom\nAnd my aunt and other survivors have you know there have namely that they felt obliged they felt obligated to teach to to reach out to young people to make sure that what happened to them what happened to those who perished wouldn't be forgotten\nAnd in some anti feel responsibility and a privilege as my mother son to continue that I I'm not a survivor but I can leverage the power of the theater to touch people that's my intent\nPretty much when I got here ... yeah well it's a it's a compelling evening of theater uh Wednesdays through Saturdays at eight\nSunday at two Sundays at two through November fourth Roger Grunwald ... Tour de force performance in the obligation at the church state patrol stage\nDot O. R. G. for more information there at sixteen Ninety five Eighteenth street in San Francisco I Wish you a terrific grunt let's talk against infection yes thank you David nice to be here [noise]\nYou can\nKnow go\nTo Michelle\nMan\nMusic that you'll hear prior to the production of the obligation starring Roger Grunwald ... stage patrol stage dot org for more information about the performance and\nIt was a pleasure to talk once again with composer conductor I'm Sorry conductor Pablo at us because Saddam who's come back to San Francisco symphony once again he's been\nCaptivated by the sounds of flamenco and composers from all around the world have written music in the Spanish style so uh I ... I decided to put a program together to conduct Spanish works by Frenchman\nIncluding rebels sultry bone marrow WC use on the ...\nPostcard barrier and added to the program Spanish your piano virtuoso Harvey ... performing ... piano concerto number three I caught up with the maestro backstage should they be solved just the other day after arsenal there's that conversation\nMaestro such a pleasure to welcome you back to our program open air my pleasure and his goal was to come to ... to San Francisco and to talk with you well we talked a little bit in the hallway before this actual interview and is it true that this is really the first time that you've actually conducted the bowl narrow in concert\nThat is true there was a was keeping it like a secret that's a well this is something a very special for me the whole program and all these species have done it many times I've recorded name and the tour with them and even the video which is the ... the less familiar one but\nIt's funny that we bought it at all\nSo the context to program eats that I thought\nThis was a perfect location to two and such a great program them based on Spanish inspired music a foreclosure inspires me I say with this with this wonderful piece and ... and you know I'm very happy that is my first time is here in San Francisco with with these or casinos are well and they love so much ... well\nA piece like bone marrow it seems like you to almost let the orchestra go on auto pilot I mean they know what's so well you know what's so well what are you bringing to the podium that might be different or do you just kind of stay out of the way\nWell it's it's as with every piece of music of course I'm a ... a very complex and and sophisticated beast needs a lot of [noise] a lot of help from the conductor or a lot of work\nAnd this one are you are right I mean it was the the snare drum stars then it goes to the end Fifteen minutes and but then of course it's very important your presence there are with\nEach other ... each of the section especially when Dale ... grows and grows and and ah you know that your ... confidence to the orchestra and strength and to keep the reason sharp\nAnd proud and and and ... and the ... LA again to flow in when it gets a heavier and began to another uh it it said something very special you you have to be there and you have to control over those aspects met at the same time and you have to know your role and you have to know how to step back as well well\nEveryone gets to work out into space that's for sure but especially the snare drum or who are uniquely positioned in the middle of the orchestra have you seen that done before or did you just want to try that as something different\n[noise] um I haven't seen that before but I've I've seen in different positions in in different settings or\nIn some concerts I Pretend to with with these these bats ah [noise]\nI I thought it could be somehow like when you have in the rock workers for the gym but all are put in the middle of the orchestra which is like a it's it's keeping and holding the rhythm together when you put a lot of the hops court in in the middle of in a row can assemble and uh you know it's like the\nLike the the the center point when and that keeps everything to gather that three them it's a kind of also conductor someone who leads the big army of musicians have has behind him and it works I spoke with a\nWith a with a ... player and he was very happy to try and and and it works very very well and everyone was very happy then also you thoughts\nOf visual um elements that he's also very effective and and you know very very very nice to see\nWell I'm sure it's always exciting to conduct a new orchestra that you haven't had as much familiar time with I'm sure it's also very rewarding to come back to an orchestra that you have such a nice relationship with and you know some of the musicians and you know what they can produce\nThe course this is a this for me it's such a\nSuch a gift I mean every every time every occasion I come back to San Francisco\nI Am just counting the days to to to come back here or because it really I cannot think of any other orchestra and the world I believed such a relation with um I've conducted\nPractically all over the top of his resume in the world in in in the past Fifteen Years and I keep going back to [noise]\n... and sometimes even coming a couple of times a year we made even some festival of two consecutive weeks on the theme we've explored viscerally\nAs we kind of possible repertoire from early but rock\nFrench grown up to two commissions to to a a word from years to come every possible style every possible configurations and then it sort of built a strong religion with players with the place would also with the city\nAnd uh I mean on state but also offstage or I can count so many times that I've\nGone with the players to sailing debate\nWith some of the musicians and and so it's a it's something really I I it pressure very match this religion and and this is why also every time I come here there is all every ... is it's absolutely unconventional at least challenging\nIt's it's a it's a new chance to explore new ideas and new aspects of this orchestra\nAnd every time is a it's a he's a great surprise and a great a music celebration for me well\nThat's a good time to renew those ties and those relationships because uh you know there's an opening here and a couple of years\nYeah I I Know that I Know that and then and precisely because I mean it's an orchestra I I Am ... and I think\nIt's it's still in this ... in this moment\nWhen the every everyone used to say that well more or less now there's the globalization and every orcas which tends to sound more as the same and there's not so much personality and they're just replay\nThing these orchestra keeps a very strong personality types to and you know uh it seemed Twenty years with the same music director and still going on and they're still making really an interesting problem in ... in challenging the audience and and and keeping everyone\nYou know excited and engaged and and and this is unique and is it out of the DNA of the orchestra\nAnd uh that's\n... you know this is a quality that Michael she sometimes has has a\nHe knows he's you know how to\nKeep she's enough to see some of the onus on these shows and and the and the audience as well and and the thing he's heritage is it's fantastic that uh [noise] you know you never know now the next ... to ... and um\nYou know it will be a very curious who who is taking over for for the next generation the next street over the circus right which is a it looks really very very exciting and and that would be very happy and then\nMargaret also teaches so low performance and as a tenured artist in residence at bravo theater in San Francisco her twelfth and apparently final show Latin standards\nExplores the loving funny and true story of perseverance and creative addiction passed down\nFrom immigrant father to his lesbian daughter she describes life as the blustery child of a child of a blustery Cuban job and that is both blessed I'm sure livid portrayals of characters from the sixties\nIn Manhattan to present day San Francisco such a pleasure to welcome market back to our our stage of open air [laughter]\nSo glad to be here I Love the show Oh thank you for doing it for ...\nWell last time we had you on it was a for a an appearance um in July with my guest host Peter Robinson to talk about a king of Cuba and they'll say it ain't so twelve than final\nWhere's that what's that all about [noise] you know um\nIt well okay to be perfectly honest I Am not retiring no way I'm just getting started baby but I have written twelve one person shows and a lot of the shows are about ... ah my parents and in fact that's how I started I'm\nEnjoying suddenly at the marsh where I Am now a in Nineteen Ninety One I wrote a piece about my mother called memory tricks\nAnd since then um I've written a new solo show every couple of years about something that is\nSomething that just really appears to me something that is obvious that I Want to write about this I Want to figure it out and explore it I think that it would have relevance to people and I've done that uh since Ninety One and well I pretty much um talked about everything I Need to\nUm as one person so now I Want to you know I Want to explore the things I'm a standup comic I Want to go back to that I Want to um\nPerhaps strike for more than one character but you know worse more lines for me [laughter] out is that\nMore than one character meaning more than one actual person because you often inherited many\nThe habit major changes issue I could take players are bad and you know just divvied up a little um but the the premise of the show is that it is my final farewell concert and um\nAnd it's also my first concert so um but it is my last one in of course I've got like twelve more coming in Berkeley will tell us about the the concert end of this that and I go\nThe um again out of the twelve pieces some of them just happened accidentally some of them happened because I'm offered a commission\nThis show started because of that I wasn't sure what my next solo show was going to be but I knew that I wanted to kind of wrap it up at twelve just numerology ugly speaking [noise]\nAnd I was offered a commission from a theater that I won't mention but it was in LA and they were going to um have all this money for a mixed media a performance and they said well Margie just can't go and tell the story you gotta do something else and I thought\nI thought well if I if I talked about these songs that my father wrote because my father really in my mind in the mind of his fans was a comedian or producer but he also wrote a couple of successful songs in Spanish that went up on the charts in um Spanish billboards\nSo I thought if I bring in these songs which I actually have like\nThe original um envelopes that he would mail to themself in lieu of actually going through the trouble of getting the copyright people thought back then if you send something to yourself registered then nobody can steal steal it so I had these envelopes I had the songs I had the actual recordings and I thought\nI'm going to do something with this so my first thought was I'm gonna I'm deconstruct them and I'm going to rock 'em out and like and then the money didn't come through the commission was actually sort of pie in the sky but it was already starting to write about my father as a songwriter\nAnd and other parts of his life that were just cool and happy and I started writing\nUm sometimes I get down be but I decided to write about all the best memories with my father and all the all the memories that made me go into this business in the way that he did which is kind of versatile in micro managing and all that and\nI happened to mention this to mark Russell who was presenting a under the radar festival off Broadway at the public theater [noise]\nAnd my director of many shows David Schweitzer and all of a sudden Latin standards was the thing and ... and it opened in twenty Seventeen that the the public theater and\nUh the times was there I had laryngitis that night I was ready to be killed I was ready but really for sure it's my last show but it I I made it\nTo us but yeah so tell us about what it was like growing up with a Willie ... you're done well is that our we citizenship earlier you know a ... jacket jak Reddit chip I read but he took it from ... a new is\nMy ... my parents were both like Latino Franco files for I guess it was part of their generation like France was the coolest thing to me and so\nYeah he just lifted shovel you from from worries and it was wonderful I mean I uh [noise]\n... my relationship with my mother is fraught um she didn't she wanted a girly she was actually more than a girly girl she wanted a little drag queen I think I read about you know like you know mom and she made me where these dresses but I really just\nThe equivalent for tiger mom and Latin culture I don't know [noise] ... taco momma momma off ... ...\nMy dad um you know he just he made me feel like I could do anything he made me feel\nUm loved and that I was completely perfect and so although they both loved me and my parents have their reason for being knocked the parents my father even though everything was\nHe was going to put me in a TV show where I played a child detective the purple girl but it was wonderful to grow up that way with just an imaginative father and the problem is you know a promise maker or even if they didn't come through because well we have is hope\nI'm so it was it was really great it gave me a really great sense of myself and uh [noise]\nAnd then through the years of course I you know a battle to keep that\nYeah that eagle go and um he was ah my parents were both um in show business and he ran these variety show so I always had these very flamboyant\nLatino singers and ah I had we also have female impersonators they were very popular even in the shows back then mid century people just\nChristine Jorgensen worked with in my father's show you know Christine Jorgensen the world's first trans woman celebrity\nUm so she you know she was one of his biggest draws I mean this was always appreciated by the Latino culture and picked up when I worked with with my father all of these people so it was a pretty awesome\nWay to grow up while could we hear just a really brief excerpt from the show\n[laughter] a really brief okay just um get the hook out and I'm\nBringing up some music underneath you just so you know\nOh okay well um and so on the show that I'm I'm doing at the Martian Berkeley is is um is is in the form of a concert and so I introduce these songs and I introduced some because my concert is for people who never want the song introduction to and\nSo I say this is my father's song and it'll do most Scott alone [noise]\nUm it's sad like all will each have all your songs and follows his usual arc the woman is cruel the man is good and all his sons were inspired by my mom he's\nAlways the victim and she's the dream and then it moves to meet a speaking the song over the music\nAnd then my father says that I never knew that and I wrote him off scot
