Jenkins and about girl her evening legs collaboration between her drag queen persona phoney and her ... life has been an electronic composer mark Kate\nPlus open there's regular contributor and critic at large Peter Robinson talks with Irish author Paul ... due in about the third annual Irish arts and writers festival during which Fifteen Irish authors artists and poets descended on the bay area\nTo showcase nest and contemporary Irish arch and literature and stay with us\nACT is putting on a twenty first century theatrical spin on nineteenth century American explorer and one armed civil war veteran John Wesley Powell\nAnd has brought me in a collected band of men soldiers ... adventures who explored Wyoming's waterways it's a story that was inspired by his actual travel log from Eighteen sixty nine\nBut uh this ingenious script by Jacqueline Bach house contains neither men or women or men boats court rivers here to talk about men on boats is director ...\n... is a a cofounder of pop up theatrics an artistic director of the five boroughs one city initiative at working theater Catherine Romans is a uh in the program MSA program at ACT who's credits also include\nThe Livermore Shakespeare festivals production of the importance of being Ernest welcome Catherine welcome time I'm Glad to be here well this is ah\nA ... ... when did you first come across a this this incredible story of ... of the scripted jak on John ... off the ...\nHave made a big splash in New York I'm just a couple of seasons ago called them and um everybody I Know it was talking about it [laughter]\nAnd then I I'm just uh got a call from um panicking and who's that new ours is director here at ACT that asked if I Would be interested in talking about this play and I was sort of like I Love that place would be very interested in that way [noise]\nSo I'm I'm I've known about the play itself since I guess it it began and have been a fan of it and just really feel very lucky to be able to get my hands on it so you're giving your own spin I'm given it\nWell I'm I'm you know we are as an ensemble the company given it a good spin yes [laughter] for sure [laughter]\nGo through this was recording experience for you coming on board the show as well\nYeah definitely ah being an MSA student we got the opportunity and our second year to audition for the shows and the next season ah\nAnd if we are fortunate enough to get cast we get to do it so it is incredibly exciting for me to get to work alongside these very talented seasoned a San Francisco actors posts a little bit about your character and then will dissect the story a little bit short I am saying George Young Bradley the youngest member of the expedition\nHe is Nineteen years old and a very enthusiastic a and excited to be brought along the journey not unlike how I feel in this process [laughter] typecast things [laughter] yes very much of a different gender [noise] yeah it is that is definitely true\nSo a tunnel that this is an old woman production of a of a historic event but how how is the history incorporated into are offering it to the public in a slightly different way well a Jacqueline\nHas ingenious laid taken this um Journal of John Wesley Powell which is actually quite I'm exciting [laughter] I've ever read 'em and he's a little poetic and his description of the the perils of the journey and the um\nThe successes or along the way and she has um\nWoven together a tale that exist between the rivers and the campsite\nUm where we follow these uh this company um of people who are I think ultimately hoping to make history you know\nUm they're charging an uncharted lamb they are um endorsed by the government it is just post civil war there's a kind of putting back togetherness of the country and I'm a I'm an opportunity to re investigate the identity of the\nOf the country and um and who you are as a citizen of that\nUm and I think Jacqueline has put forward a very pure adventure I'm at a where there are people who are entering into a landscape into a frontier hoping to discover something new not just about the land around them about themselves also ... then it's\nA a structure particularly contemporary record or having an all female cashed\nYeah yeah I think the point a or the invitation to the audience is to say you know the story of adventure belongs to all of us\nAnd um [noise] it's not a it's on a trick it's not a a kind of like crafty thing it is a way of opening up the narrative\n'em to show I think are to demonstrate or to invite people to see that the space can be occupied in other ways and that the\nA um remains in some ways I think is even more eliminated\nAnd it goes beyond a particular gender absolutely it does so what we if we're not going to be seeing rivers are both what will we we'd be seeing onstage well we won't put the rivers of the boats but I think you'll see the rivers on the boats by the time we're finished with you [laughter]\nWe're inviting people back to their active imagination than you know I think that the theater is one of the few places left where\nUm all the things that are possible or not right in front of you where you yourself have to lean into the story and uh you know you can you can bring back that five year old who\nCan you know who could fly that five year old who absolutely saw the tooth fairy back five year old [laughter]\nYou know who ... who's imagination was hampered by sort of being the socialized world and that's that's what we get to do in the theater all the types of this play absolutely\nDoes that show you obviously are very familiar with the players were you did you go to some of the source material of\nPaul yeah I Do all the way in and of Alamos rabbit holes [laughter] not only did I read um LBJ journals but I also read the the the journals that have now been recovered bus from some of the other\nPeople who are on the expedition and it's just it's so interesting because one of the things that the play does very well is helps us understand that the the story that's being told is the point of view of the storyteller\nYou know it's not a it's not a story that represents all of these men's experiences though Powell puts forth all of their experiences\nWhen I read the other journals the other uh um folks on the expedition have air we different points of view of how these events unfold and even of each other than Powell a put forth in his journals young\nBradley is not so young and not so eager and his own [laughter] sure know what's a ... he was an opportunity to be a mentor\nAnd well this is being billed as a whole new areas laugh out loud theater is that come in that sense of humor coming just from the the switching of of a ...\nSupport and love and they banned it together and giving presents and walk my dog and you know I felt like I it helped me through a very difficult personal time to have this community duck so I thought okay I'm In a meadow I'm outside and we're in mission fake I could do if he's with dogs in it\nSo [laughter] I'm a huge dog lover and I um I thought\nOkay how could I possibly do this as an homage to the the um the unconditional love of dogs and the support of a dog community so the pieces in two parts of risk probably takes place in a big hill that we call the mound that it does not have dogs in it it's called the wind at your back\nAnd that is really about using the heal as kind of a a metaphor getting through\nUm life continuing and then the second part is called canine comfort and that has to duck pieces one is um do wet for one of the dancers in the ... and her great Aussie Howard with the dancers in the background and then the last section\nIs using um teams of dogs that do chick it's geometric formations that walk through the LDC professional dancers as um they're doing a lot of dancing and so I tried to keep the the duck part fairly simple\nI'm I have three teams of dogs are Fifteen\n... there's only so much so many moves you can teach them very well I tried to get you know I wasn't looking for a circus trick trained dogs um I was really looking for for ... so they had to be able to sit on command they had to be able to walk on a leash um they had to be able to be a quiet and not work\nWith a lot of activity going around the ... no ... we had what we jokingly called the dog dish and where we had a dog show up at the park\nAnd we just put them through a lot of walking patterns and you know I didn't reject any of them actually [laughter] give us is the first time it animals have been involved with a new production\nYes I Believe so I'm so excited that is happening started the ... yeah I mean I Know there's been other people maybe I've done animals in theaters and whatnot but not in trolley dances\nWell I always say never performed with animals but you know it's been it's been really\nA wonderful thing there's something about the dogs that there is so in the present and then when they come to rehearsal they're just wanting to please and they you know they're with their owners and they um this is something very optimistic about them so it was a you know really a pleasure to have\n'em have that in rehearsal and also the fact that the the dog owners are some of them a couple of them are dancers\nBut most of them or not they're just people who I met at the dog park or you know who I\nNever heard about the peace and want to divvy it so there's that kind of everyday to Destin morality to let that I also\nYou know for me is just about what getting through everyday life is ...\n... ... are caught his work is going to be performed up the mission Creek Park as part of San Francisco trolleys after ... obviously some Greek cares to begin with this spots that you chose yeah for each of these routes what what particular spot stands out do you think oh my gosh I've got to do something in this ... this week from tomorrow\n[noise] was more\nHow do I carve it from where I began and we're\nWhat do I find of interest in that neighborhood so that's when I I've been to the park mission creek a few times and I always said oh this is so beautiful right in the water because it's very hard to get sites on the water\nVery usually very expensive permits along the Embarcadero [noise] um so I worked at the park and we figured it out and it would just I thought oh people will love this they can hang out in the part they could see dads it's a beautiful place to begin\nSo once I knew I had that then I find the other things that um I think of er of interest in that area\nLike mercy housing [noise] um they're all over the city working with seniors have nice places to live\nUm so and then on the other side of the ... there was a potential for having a site and then I go and I say well what's a good route where do I want to land\nSo I wanted to go back to some sites the done before so Robert Moses kid is actually in a site that I did the first year of Troy dances and then just sullied Joe from steam roller is he was a native land that first year and this year he's in the ... on these\nSort of his mural and he's redoing of peace he had done about gay marriage\nAnd so he's translating that so I also thought about what can I bring that that would be interesting and how would it change and then what is the pathway and the least really amount of walking\nA because there's a two hour tour and it can be tiring and then once I knew I could get into a s F ... hour to get really excited about that my site and I'm working with Steven can't\nA where the Richard Sayre a sculpture is on the Howard street entrant though they're dancing on all those big wooden steps wow\nSo it's really just as sort of comes together um it's not necessary always easy I might get something to lose something along that journey because it's a lot for a sight to take on\nYou know us being in there dancing rehearsing bringing audiences insurance [laughter] sure [laughter]\nYou've used the word that I Want to focus on a landing of ... because a lot of these ... or at least some of the works that are being done are practically search to salute quality I mean there's an aerial\nA component of them are there in terms of space yeah using not just the ground you know\nWe use everything that's for sure I always say if my sneakers could talk\nYou know how to really get in and meet meet a neighborhood and that's a big part of it is meeting the people that live there and then what art groups are there\nSo I'm really excited for everybody come October twentieth and twenty first\nAnd the a meeting places for thing channel right up missing mission creek park is not far from the Caltrans station is also in the end and the tea\nDo right there
