the soundscape from the group skip the needle that will be heard this weekend as an intern generational cast the bay area dance luminaries performs the world premiere of spirit and bones by Sarah Bush dance project [noise]\nJoining me in Studio ... is the bottom is Sarah Bush as well as three members of skip the needle composer bassist Vicki Randall guitarist\nWelcome to you all to our studios thanks saving quite a quite a gang we had heard about this let's start with Sarah what was the inspiration for spirit and ball\n[noise] um well it's an idea I had for a while about when to make a work about this time of year the time of year when the\nDays are getting shorter the nights are getting longer there's more darkness and ... and I'm an opportunity to look at everything that is beautiful and the rich and powerful about darkness so celebrating the time of year and then after the last presidential election\nI felt um once I got off the couch and Netflix um [laughter]\nI felt really moved to make work that I'm was honoring women very explicitly and honoring women in every age in stage of their life and experience um so it was really clear to me I Want it to make intergenerational work\nAnd I've had the opportunity to work with a couple of the dancers who are in the show before and last year um worked with Joan Lazarus and sewage you and had the um\nThe the gift of working with them and seeing that their years of experience in as dancers and ask performers I'm was so moving and powerful onstage so I was excited to just brought not experienced that much more so yeah we've got the answer is who are incredible at age twenty three up to Seventy one all of them just outstanding and I feel\nIs going to ask how you felt some of these dancers and I know that my own fifty six year old body does not perform like one twenty third year old body as much as I Am denial about that what it is what is it like as a dancer aging knowing that you could do some things but you can do some things to before\nYeah I've exactly in the middle I'm forty two and so I feel like I'm I'm at that exact crossroads where I Am so aware of the things that my body isn't as good at doing anymore but I'm also really aware of the things I Am better at doing and I think that's what we're all looking at in this show\nThat um there's things your body can do when you're twenty three and there's things that your performance quality and your life experience the way you carry yourself on stage that actually deepens and um I think becomes more rich as you age so\nYeah there is an interesting analogy as a musician the flu this you know I I I play Mozart a little bit differently than I thought I was a twenty three year old I've ever been a little bit of experience that makes up for maybe the facility\nBut I think everyone can probably relate to it and they're in their own feel that there's things that we let go of that there's things that we continue to deepen our um expertise that\nWell I'm hoping that this is as much as the election than the current occupant is served as some sort of inspiration for this but it's becoming a positive about the that's coming out of this\nVery much so um I feel like we're all already feeling it in the theater that I'm with everything that's going on in the world with our personal lives um there is always so much loss and so much hard news and so much struggle that to come together and feel like we are I'm bringing together our energy to shift that too um\nIt's spirit and bones it feels like we are on pushing out with this the spirit spirit of power of hope on of optimism of another way of looking at how we're all relating in the world and that's hopefully just flooding right out of that beautiful season\nTickets are that's going to be at the uh the world Trade Center for opera and the ... the great space for them to her just yes or we need to involve some of the wonderful musicians that are involved in this production of basis composer Vicki riddle formerly the Tonight Show and currently backing or maybe the staples\nOr an outside player composer pianist Julie wolf guitarist Katie cash all part of the group ah skip the needle Vicki told me a little bit about the group\nRight so uh so named because um each one of us in this band when we started out come from a really different musical tradition and um each had our own band for years um and uh Katie is\nKatie said resident shredder\n[laughter]\nUm I think I don't know you can speak for yourself about your background yeah I'm a law firm right away\nAnd the plane um you know I primarily have uh fronted rock bands or been part of of a more traditional a rock bands I'm so this was a different experience for me definitely a yeah a very wrenching experience but you know we\nBrought we brought in a I mean we were bringing in a coffee brown from the country brown ban a who is a a and M.\nC. and is like an R. and B. and funk truths and show it already has also a shredder just slightly\nDifferent shredding I'm a a trajectory coming from the gym banned the land you know uh and\nJulie wolf who is like comic um as a composer in a in a player um\nI'm not I'm not going to talk to you\n[laughter] um well I'm well I'll talk about my background a little bit and how it uh\nFolds into this piece um I come from an improvisational background I came up as a jazz musician [noise] um I ah was on the road with Sarah songwriters for\nOver Twenty years and now I'm off the road and producing music um and and the improvisation background is really serving me and I think our group as we hold space for Sarah's dancers there Vicky did the lion's share of the\nComposing for this peace and so there are structured pieces and some improvisational moments with in the structure pieces but they're also ... pieces that are completely improvised and\nThink so actually I mean and I'm the first to revise my work sort of obsessively but I'm really happy and I it's a lot of that is just because the orchestra is so amazing and and Christian ... muscle Lara who's conducting the\nUm who I have not worked with before has become a great friend of composers and he really knows how it works you know how to how to premier a piece in the kind of things that we need to adjust and I feel really excited you know we just heard the dress rehearsal of it I'm In the last hour and a half and it was wonderful\nWe have a wonderful gift for ... and I always hearken back to um you know some of the great Russian orchestrate or did you take a page out of ... course off\nI mean if I could ... if I could orchestrate ... it'd be you know I mean Steven skiing and rebel are you know inspirations um and I gotta say John Williams because those pieces just come off the stage I mean his his orchestral music for the films um and there's definitely a cinematic elements in music and stuff\nAnd so who was who was the guiding hand for you as you were coming as together as a composer\nThat just order that oh my ... really artistically and musically ... basically my own here I mean I had really supportive teachers who just sort of let me be who I was instead of trying to make me be someone else and so I have a lot of different teachers um\nAnd there were all great and and I learned something different from each of them but I've I think I've always felt like there is a kind of music that I Love and I want to ride it no matter what you know the kind of fall out is from that and sometimes they're it's difficult you know you get resistance from various places but um I definitely had supportive\nTeachers you mentioned a couple of things that are coming up what what else are you looking forward to have your own ... um well\nYeah I just knew a piece about I'm keeping Stiglitz has called the brightness of light that will premier I'm a next summer of ... going to several opera company is a orchestras in in a couple of other companies I'm\nAnd I'm right now are about

Judi Dench is essentially leading a conversational many of these occasions\nAnd it seems strange to see somebody who's played the clip ... member seeing her playing against density Hopkins and I'm seeing them haul truck\nOut but it's also played in James Bond movies so you're getting the full range of my very sophisticated actress and indeed all the others have the same claim to fame\nI think it's also a movie about aging gracefully and aging was west and leading the which I Would put Maggie Smith on top of the list or she is totally with it\nOr we get cut off from her when she was in Downton Abbey but we also go back each time they join the conversation to flashes in my own head and I remember playing in the pride of the mainstream ...
