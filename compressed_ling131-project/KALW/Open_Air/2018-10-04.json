D. from Columbia Law where she was a Columbia human rights fellow\nA pleasure to welcome you back hope thank you so much happy to have you she's joined by poet playwright and scholar max credible whose work engages experimental forms and political context his book about aids archives and cultural memory the Nancy Reagan collection is forthcoming\nAnd he currently teaches feminist gender and sexuality studies at Stanford max welcome to you thanks\nSo first of all hope how did you first meet max\nMax wants to tell her first you know [laughter]\nWell I was joking when we were on our way over here that uh it was inevitable that we would meet because\nHope is a dancer who loves literature and I'm a writer who loves to dance so when I first moved to the bay about three years ago and I have attended a ton of programming that hopes Don shift so fabulous for the bay area and so it's been so great to now work together\nAnd the topic of south of how did that come up between you [noise]\nI Hope or I uh\nFound ... through the work of and Carson\nUm I'm a big fan of Carson's work and I cut her acted\nCarson's and taken ... twenty Fifteen for shock on players and really wanted to do another project that within conversation with her work\nSo um I read her translations of ... which came out in two thousand two if not winter and love them and ask cartoons commission to work with them to craft a multidisciplinary performance and happily she said yes\nMm nice um so for those of us not up on our great poets tell us a little bit about ... if you would\nShare um she is the first known a woman writer she lived in seventh century bc e ... on the island of Lesbos in Greece\nAnd she many credit her with um inventing the lyric I or poetic expression in the first person well and that was the contact that really intrigued me in addition to the fact that most of her work\nSurvive ... has been lost most of it now survives only and fragmentary form and I'm very interested in the fragment as a as a competition all idea\n\nMax um [noise] how are you into weaving the with the work of suffer with your own writing\nA I think that through\nBeen a really collaborative process and I myself have just been fascinated to meditate on south of use of the first person I her use of the lyric forearm\nAnd sue and thinking about how to update that for today we really I mean I and and the whole company have really taken\nSort of ... so we've been watching\nSome of the moves that she makes in in these lyrics and we've been thinking about what we can pull from them into today so one thing that I think as a writer it's been fascinating for me is is to look at that first person and see actually how unstable that voice is in South though how dependent it is on\nOther people on a public on other women that are in her world\nPolice hope something that and Carson talks about in relationship to ... um sapphires poetry is known for being a lot about ecstasy and desire but and Carson says that South I use is ecstasy as a means to an end um as a means to transcend the south\nSo paradoxically Saffo\nAnyway invented the south to get beyond the south and so Craig graphically I've been interested in how\nUm I for example I've been encouraging the dancers used form to get past the farm so how can they use set a dance material to to get past that into um an ecstatic state Mm interesting\nI I we didn't talk to about this beforehand but I see a will book marked till next to you where are you able to share a couple of passages\nYeah we love to read a couple of fragments IMAX generally the first one\nYeah great I'm going to read fragment Ninety four\nI simply want to be dead\nWeeping she left me with many tears and said this\nOh how badly things have turned out for us Saffo I Swear against my will I leave you\nAnd I answered her rejoice go and remember me for you know how we cherished you\nBut if not I want to remind you and beautiful times we had\nFor many crowns a violets and roses at my side you put on and many woven Garland made of flowers around your soft throat\nAnd with sweet oil costly\nYou annoying to yourself\nYou would let loose your longing\nAnd either any nor any holy\nPlace nor was there from which we were absent so I Hope the listeners have heard the sort of ... in the middle I'm about ... when I paused those are words that those silences represent words that were lost Mm\nCan I read a bit please so I'd like to read an excerpt from fragments thirty one and all this is a five minutes of the dancers and I have worked a lot with in terms of its redneck structure\nBefore you do that 'cause you could you tell us up these called you should start a fragment Ninety four or thirty one how were these phones in what condition where the in uh our our they know archived\nYeah they they're they've been found throughout the throughout the ages on crumbling pieces of Paris and often in very deteriorated a condition do you have anything to add to that mix\n'em they're found in the most unexpected ways uh there was two new homes were found in twenty fourteen um they're found in some some of the pirates with you\nStill found in ... within an elaborate process of identification that happens\nInteresting I'm interrupted you hope you were talking about the meter that you're trying to get your dancers to coordinate with\nYes we each a section of the dancers anchored in a particular fragment and a lot of times I use the redneck structure of the language\nI'm to inform the structure of the dance um and also I think this fragment really represents how ... palms invite 'em invite the listener into embodiment\nTongue breaks and thin fire is racing under skin and in ... site and drumming fills ears and cold sweat holds me and shaking grips me all greener than grass I Am in dead\nOr almost I seemed to me\nBut all is to be there to because even a person of poverty\nSay no you ... you bring up an interesting point the rhythm of this of of Paul [noise] but it's also the rhythm of the translation of your home so how do we know if it is or is it even necessary to know the rhythm of the original language\nThere's been many translations of ... and I think one of the reasons that Carson's translations have been so acclaimed is she really ... speak for herself\nMany translators have attempted to filling the gaps and guess what south I was saying and add flourishes in stanzas and Carson really just\nLet Saffo stand for itself um she doesn't embellish it at all see anything to add to that and\nI'm just that you know there's this awful on the page in translation and ... the translators are really attuned to the meter because it's thought that Sacco saying these songs right that the lyrics were always song in a ... in public um as a collective right with other people\nSo part of our process husband to go back to that stuff though the public's eye photos I suppose in collaboration\nOf hope what will we see the speed is being presented in the round of this was a conscious choice obviously yeah and why did you do that\nI wanted to create an intimate immersive experience for the audience\nUm so people will see a people entering the environment and there is a section of text and there's dance and the two are interwoven that's a very um cross disciplinary experience there's also force headed video projection designed by and winter's so there's a lot of different elements woven together\nAnd they talk over each other and yet you can't miss anything yeah that's true because there's so much of the exposition is layered in their very subtly\nAnd uh if if if the actors we had to be very careful that\nChristmas written the lines to specifically to overlap at certain points\nBut you've got to know who is the who is where the volume is up [laughter] you know it's like in a in a symphony if you're if the flu is playing solo we need to bring the strengths down right in order to hear the flu so it's kind of like it was constantly are constantly\nOrchestrating that that first scene because we knew if we didn't get that first scene right\nThe audience would never be able to follow the rest of the play\nAnd this this set design is is really ingenious as well I understand that you've decided not to necessarily\nInduced paranoia but adding to the sense of a Cold War asked feel to it you're getting the impression that you may be seen and observed from angles you're not aware of the chances are you're being watched\nI think that was the whole idea um the set was not by me it was by and ... and when she and I talked about it we knew we wanted to do something a little surreal\nBecause the play itself is are real and may or may not be happening on on on different a sort of parallel universes some of the scenes don't seem to really be happening in ordinary temporal reality\nUh and so we one of the way to sort of stress that so\nWe had this um mirrors overhead that reflect the characters back to themselves but distorted a little bit in the mirrors and it was a lot of fun and then of course there's the two\nGiant horizontally hung read with logs or the back of the set which creative very ominous quality as if\nThey're precariously hung their on um you know and fishing line and worth data come undone they would most certainly roll over the actors and out into the audience so it creates this wonderful sense of danger [noise]\nOne of the cast members as original to the sandbox series of that's a ... little little row row also features Cassidy brown Katie Ruben and Joe Maher talk
