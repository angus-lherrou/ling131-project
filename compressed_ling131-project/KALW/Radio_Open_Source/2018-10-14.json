the end really the end what's it like to be drawing in that mystery\nWhen I applied myself as being a technical optimist the typical pessimist we have the technology already which could allow a better

cetera so we want to avoid that\nAnd this new report which is based on that justifies the previous one does suggest that people have to stop now and make a big transformation\nIn the next Fifteen Years or so the only realistic win win situation\nWhich is a way which we could have a transition to uncover in the world would be if we can accelerate research and development into oil ... feet

Lula da dum de unhealthy and they need a major read\nLong history\nThan this game and what what the what are the insiders inside line and this report\nI I think it's an important report which are sort of surprising report in the surprise is\nHow we keep getting surprised about the same thing again and again and again uh I don't think it's a more frightening report in previous ones are as you are interested we've been sleeping so we haven't been hitting what the BCC has been saying we haven't been hitting what nature has been telling us all around us not just in Florida\nI all over south ... south east Asia all over Europe [noise] and uh so so in in some ways you know uh it's it's like you\nDid seem to think it should be tried again and again and again\nWhat what's new in these cascading feedback loops for example\nSo I I think what's new here is this one point five degree sort of which has become the new uh ... give a dog get that off to the world is going to somehow become a is reverse simply different\nPoint is that the voters or maybe it was simply different that for hundreds of millions of people in the world the Buddhist people in the what some of the ... the word to climate change is not something you talk about the future tests\nYou find that change is something that has hit that is happening at this happening now and my um issue but the report if any is that it's maybe not fighting enough it's it's trying to fight in the ... about the future\n... really fully telling us about the president I can see why they're doing it because they want this book author mostly you and meet people people who are affluent into action and this is one more tempted saying he'll guard please do something and do it now I\nThink that's the that's a good message but there's another message and the messages that climate change is happening now it's happening in ... it's happening in Pakistan it's happening in Haiti it's happening and malicious it's happening\nIn in in revenue to and it's happening and this is the key point it is happening mostly not most is happening with Greivis consequences in places which had been nice to do with causing the problem\nSo those who had nice to do with making the mess on at the front forefront of having to deal with that that is why I think climate is a justice issue and this report as well as previous IPC seat reports I don't think I've done justice to climate as a justice of ...\n[noise] yeah we can get ahead around so many aspects would stick with justice for the ... one of the blocks in our understanding or just our humanity\nI have this storm say how many other\nPlace I think it does the humanity um that is at best here I think I just had has not science like we I was just keeps coming up in ... I'm a fan of fight BCC I mean part of it but this is no longer a question of science the big thing is the big challenges knocked\nWhether we have enough science or not the big challenges whether we have enough action or not and why is that not happening that just eat a question of odd of humanity as you point that I eat of ethics and within ... as a species are fully evolve to look at ourselves and I said why religious speeches and I'm not sure we are\nAnd the second thing is I think this is they just enough technology there's enough science there's enough knowledge for us to make a difference\nI Am not convinced anymore but there is enough visited him in a species to act in time and to act\nFor the benefit of the entire species or if I can say something rather harsh or with your permission I think in some ways all of us who saved the climate change sheet asleep do not actually take it seriously enough\nBecause we've all figured out that we probably will shrimp\nIt's kind of like a ... that was that was about to go down we all taught me to go down with it and now suddenly realize\nOh maybe not maybe some of us will make it to the fight and at that point your challenges are you going to lend a hand to those who will go down and the fact of the matter is we have not been doing that\nYou know politicians take a lot of heat and they should for being unwilling to risk their jobs but I mean every one of us I think is is is afraid to doing something serious would risk their own jobs\nSo yes oh yes I I think that is vi V. have kind of made made the fact that somehow the guards of technology\nAnd the guards off the free market ... village somehow find a solution and time for us to be saved and maybe we are right but the problem is that not all of us and we'll be saved and as I said it is those who had released to do with causing the mess that are having to face the consequences\nThere are limits here on our humanity and shame on us but there's also years and years along like butter conditioning we're told over and over again that it's it's great to be rich anybody can strive for it\n... degrees of mechanism mechanization but of privilege of leisure of fun that we have defined as human would be very hard to get up at this point [laughter]\nYes and Frank ... see that you know it's a it's a question of justice here's here's the thing of why does natured dog get deport what does nature to have to ... what does nature have against the ... people in the woods and the fact of the matter is that if you are\nFor you will end up living in the most fun ...\nAnd if you are the Buddhist living in the most ... bases you it is most likely that you do not have the ability to deal with those disasters ... so the disaster comes to Florida and the disaster comes to cut Archie oeuvre Mumbai\nBut if you are on the edge in Mumbai you're much less likely to have the resources to deal with it and and the point I'm making about you know this is no longer the future to shoot this this report and we still talk about climate as if it's something fought in the distance or maybe not that far in the distance but still something in the future\nBut to cross the world it is not the future to look at the heat waves going around ... ... a look at floods my country Pakistan there is no for the last six seven years\nBut of debts at the same time that are dropped ... at the same time there are a heat wave sticking more life encouraging this summer at that time more people died in the heat wave then through terrorism\nIn the ... right right and this is a violent place anyhow so the point I'm making just the nature of this telling us that the norm of the new normal is the climactic change not move\nFor a lot of places and who's paying the price is the Buddhist the those who are least able to do something about this those who were released responsible for causing the mess\nAnd we still talk down\nAnd the great minds of the west including that one of them and Martin rays are going to tell\nThe world or how to how to deal with the problem that we\nIn the west graded so many sort of uh\nWe we meet ourselves coming and going west produced the industrial revolution that created the problem and divided the world and still somehow we expect that those geniuses and we all know and love how I'm going to solve this problem I think I Want it I maybe you can tell us oh\nWhat do the light footprint people the world\nIn in Pakistan in Africa in China um has to offer this conversation that we're not hearing\nI did the did they do have to offer an idea of an ideal of life that is not as driven by the ideal of growth as a model is but here's the thing that we should also be concerned about the light footprint people as you as you put it\nI've seen the same word you and I\nAnd they're saying that these heavy for ... ... ... ... people\nAre taking too many resources away from me and maybe I Need to be in the same place I so we're not Martin Greece was exactly right on his you cannot you can not wind defended to the Buddhist people of the world and say why do you want to drive a car why do you want to use a French\nLike if we are not able to change our lifestyle we can not\nA adamantly Dell the oldest of the world you know you used to being great so we have to live like this but you you must save the planet for our future generation that cannot work and it's evident that it is not what can\nI Do know Joe I Want you to review your own history in this\nIn this battle or you go back to Rio and Nineteen Ninety to President George W. Bush one of his better weekends and maybe the last moment of sort of reassurance that we could we could think our way out of this box\n... you know I was a veal Nineteen Ninety two was a turning point for many of us including myself I was young I was in ... I was I was idealistic we talked we could change the world and had to do things that I remember from that one\nWhat you are probably referring to this possibly the most on a statement made by any politician ever\nAbout climate change or George Bush gum studio and says and I quote the American lifestyle is not open to negotiation and this wasn't just George Bush this is not about Trump everyone in between you and me included have essentially said\nIt's that his whole suit is on fire\nActually seeing ... wrote the piece and he joins us by phone using executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research is book in progress on politics and the age of the and through the scene the manmade Iran actually welcome\nI'm not trying to get ...\nYou said in that article is the goal of containing heat rise is on its face impossible President Trump says the same but he's not bothered by explaining that\nUm well it's not that it's not\nPossible um it's that the ... like June yet with in the systems that we have right so\nI'm the most frequently gesture to is the you know Paris climate accord um\nWhich are sort of a contradictory in and out themselves um they want to achieve that it's a nice state it targets of you know less than one point five and ... and probably you know topping out around too but they want to do it with our\nExisting social economic and political systems and I'm actually a lot of what I'm Talking to Jon just as\nI Would I Would just agree with so much of it\nUm I Would spin it ever so slightly differently though and I emphasize some different things which is that there's a word that it seems to be missing 'em from these conversations which is capitalism um it's not that humanity in is in fact\nDoing all the fangs um she managed doesn't stand in a way of um some of the mitigation adaptation efforts that could be done\nUm it's that we have a socio economic system that is predicated on the kind of extractive um fuel sources and general extractive regimes right whether we're talking about social systems\nUm economic systems and of course a fossil fuels and planetary boundaries that keep it going in the way that we now are\nYou speaking in your article is high carbon economic growth and profits too of course a and I I Wonder if I'm hearing your definition\nCapitalism in the modern world\nI mean it it's funny I'm In that same article I get into this question of of definitions to sort of obliquely at the end\nCan do that I listed a whole host of them the article um\nAnd and the\nThere's a lot of things we can do and whether or not what happens on the other side of that and I tend to agree absolutely would doctor and John but he was saying that the problem is not the future I cannot stress that enough um that that we are living through this you know right now\nUm and there's a lot that we can do and whether what what comes out of that you know what sort of springs sport is capitalism what we want to call it something else posts capitalism is it real like socialism like God Knows um but it is so dramatically different than the socio economic order we have now um and it's\nAnd it's fundamental to understand and so and that's why it's so hard to hear and I think for many people\nUm people who who you know do you propose these sort of small bore reforms whether it be you know like having a cap and trade system using market incentives when in fact we knew we need broad have a political transformation um\nAnd that the other thing I Would emphasize is uh uh I you know ... ... talking to John was correct in saying that you know this will hit\n'em hardest areas that have a ... that have contributed to lease um but that's not just sort of an iron right it's as you said it's not nature targeting people um the truth is the same system that whole that that I'm\nDr such extraordinary inequality in our world and such extraordinary I'm\nIn balance of power between global north in global south also drive and support and are necessary for the maintenance of capitalism as we know it does if we're going to have in mind that change seriously we have to take capitalism seriously\nWhen the world the capitalism created in some sense when come back to ... ... New York times you don't believe that he's not responded to this and they think he's stupid that it doesn't get it but you point out very phone scores on this problem\nAnd submitted the by the end of the century the heat rises will be not one point five it will be four degrees centigrade and there's a way I Want you to explain it in which he has incorporated this into his thinking\nAbout the world you call it and he might do right wing climate really isn't unpack\nSure happy to um you know I Do think that there's often a way in which we talk about these conversations again as if everyone like the world is going to end right it's the apocalypse like um everyone's going to die so this is that we're all gonna die right it's a\nQuote from by the ... on but the truth is actually on\nThere are a lot of people that blow a and we can sort of very easily or imagined in our minds but then the demographics um the wealth levels um the placement\nOf the people that are actually going to do pretty well through this period um and I do sort of think there is a ... you know whether a Trump actually believe it or not God Knows I'm not going to speculate about what he actually believes are not um but I Do think there was something in that um\n[noise] in that study that was so fascinating 'cause they were basically saying they were leaving that denialism behind oh there's no such thing oh it's a Chinese has a and going instead with yup it's going to happen and it's too late and there's nothing to do about it\nOn and what's so fascinating to me there is one that isn't on a statement or at least partially right they're saying the things that they were trying to overturn the fuel efficiency standards and the truth is\nLike just a couple of fuel efficiency standards that they're right that's not going to turn that's not going to turn the tide on air right when they say business as usual\nWell the ... or degree or more increase like if he knew nothing if you change now and that's what's gonna happen on those things are true and I think that that's something that um again it's sort of missing from this conversation which is that it's a political conflict um you know\nIt's strange because yeah the rising um the crisis is not going to be good for Trump's base it may be good for his ten best friends they have their minds they have their mountaintops they have their their um [noise]\nUh you know my law goes although that's going to be pretty soggy for the first five floors I Want to so do you um ideal weight is capitalism in your view figure among the obstacles to progress here or the owners of the problem\nI I think uh the the beliefs that come with the models that we have on a major part of the problem in the sense that it is this belief in the gospel of wrote a and of continues to grow old in the plan is that is a very serious levels not inflict\nA and and and everyone's growth right that's that's the thing that everyone has to constantly grew at some point nothing's going to meet involved in that one might be climate change but different people who made the border differently by my estimation it leads to a billion people in the world to date\nTwenty two thousand eighty at least a billion people in the winter do you live in what I call the age of ...\nThe the new non good in the mid ... would we have to do something to stop climate they have to actually adapt to climate that has changed for them and and that means that they have to\nKeep these these sources and use them to adapt to this ... my only issue might wonder don't issue but my only\nQuestion I think for Mr ... who I I also agree with this I Am not ask gone for doing the climate will force us to change the more you know unfortunately I think the more stronger and what do you mean\nBy the late shift of habit or privilege or these but does the balance of power\nAnd and and and ... and and the because ah I don't see the video to make the type of changes that need on\nWhat what is it political change that could work toward your dream\nTo me please uh yes and I mean ...\nStrangely uh I I there's a lot of hatred and uh I Do think you can see 'em a couple of things that it\nThat could be helpful for the political picture and I I Will say that that ... ah it's likely neither neither\nI don't even know like a fifty fifty which I think what I'm professor ... that um you know could even worse than that I'm\nNot sure example I think there's a growing awareness of of the problem I'm In a in the global north um which I think most people I've uh I've noticed is that sort of primary source of this problem um\nAnd then as you think that's all right go ahead you're asking an ideal oh no no no no no that was just I was just talking okay sorry I added to\nThat question of what people talk about just parents here [laughter] and what part media plays a we spoke with Allen West Virginia this week\nVery brave former editor of the guardian from London and he dedicated his last years and the job to a campaign was called keep it in the ground meaning all that oil gas coal that if we burn it it'll smother is for sure", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio
