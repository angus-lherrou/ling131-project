nothing is in our world today\nThat's a culture\nWhich we've created a commercial culture\nWhich orchestrate alienation loneliness unhappiness a sense of inadequacy and promises us that if we invest in that culture\nBoth financially him personally which is a culture that at its core is about the cult of the self\nWe can find the happiness that they have destroyed ... but of course as proof understood every time we buy their experience whether just commercially or emotionally or their product\nIs only the starting point for new desires ...\nAnd what in biblical terms it is\nIs a culture of our dollar tree\nAnd the writers of the Bible understood that idols demand in the beginning the sacrifice of others but in the end like more luck [noise] they always demand your sacrifice you you are sacrificed on that alter\nAnd I think that spiritual malaise that cult of the self\nHas created tremendous depression and unhappiness which is fed by this never ending cycle I mean what is Facebook\nOr Instagram or any of these other social media platforms\nThere many forms of the self presentation that obsesses a figure like Trump\nIt's what Neal Gabler called life the movie and you know we all have our own versions of it it's about posturing it's not about truth and it's certainly the opposite of friendship\nAt the cost of his job\nHe's our guest or the Cambridge forum and the first parents church in Harvard Square his new book is America the farewell tour\nYou're leaving one huge zone my favorite zone out which is George Bush and the Iraq War to my mind the light in line

the United states chose war Joe's torture\nIgnited terrorism and body ... literally killed a country in front of our eyes corrupted the Democratic opposition including our print John Kerry and destroyed the media I mean\nThe war began and went to its end with the cheerleading of those institutions including infringe on treatment Williams half hour ago David every rocks and they're still working I mean anyway\nThe point is only that to see Trump he is symptomatic of\nAll that the trail of the working class at the same time he's the most\nI must say viable person who ever tip the tables on Jeb Bush and then on the Clintons I don't want to give them any credit for it exactly that here's a question for my friend Chris Hedges\nDo you find your heart really rooting for the record is the Trump or his so to speak or you certainly don't root for the establishment where where's your heart Chris Hedges\nMy heart is with at this point the sixty or Seventy percent of Americans who are being pushed towards a modern form of serfdom in the ... system and you bring up the war\nSo and as you know I had a very contentious relationship with the New York times I'd been in the middle east bureau chief for the New York times was denouncing the war was booed off of a commencement stage and of course I actually knew the middle east and knew the instrumental war unlike banker\nAnd\nAnd I was given a formal written reprimand and told I was no longer be allowed to speak publicly about criticizing the war and I left the paper over that issue so when you talk about all those people who are wrong being still in power but that's misleading because\nThey may have been wrong but they played their role and the role of this was ... the ...\nDiscredit and you can read the review of this book in the New York times the Washington Post because that's exactly what they do to discredit\nThe critics on the left because they set the moral parameters and they are essentially given their place in a capital is democracy\nBecause they make sure nobody crosses those parameters nobody actually questions the system of capitalism nobody questions the intentions of going into Iraq they make concede afterwards that it didn't go quite as it should so they played their role perfectly which is why they're still they're not they're all\nKnow we can't talk about leaders I mean this has come a complete misreading of what's happened in this country it's far more serious than that\nAnd I think one of the things that inform this book was the two years I spent reading a book on the Christian right\nBecause the Christian right is really the amnesty but before that let me just respond one more thing on the war so in in and you know from the book in and this was from a court but late empire\nHim according to historian McCoy who wrote a very good book called shadows in the American century which I recommend he writes that empires that they're beginning actually use military force very carefully and very judiciously empires at the end in decline\nEngage in catastrophic military adventure ism\nFuels the decline in an attempt to restore last greatness so you look at for instance the end of the scene an empire\nThey invade Sicily the entire ... most of the soldiers and kill the umpires over you look at the Suez Crisis the British Empire is in decline from the end of World War one until Nineteen fifty six Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal the British invade with a French\nAnd have to retreat and humiliation\nThe pound sterling is dropped ... as the world's reserve currency and the British economy goes into a tailspin that's the death of will coy actually gives it a day which I Would never do twenty thirty but the so we have Seventeen years of warfare\nThere was a front page story about the debt did you read those I read the times tonight\nI just read that what may soon exceed the cost of the U.S military interest on us debt\nWithin a decade more than nine hundred billion in interest payments will be do annually\nThis is what happens at the end of empire you extend yourself militarily beyond your ability to sustain it financially\nAnd the cost in order to carry out this military adventure ... this is ... ... is to just hollow out the country from the inside\n... writes that the charity that Athens imposed on others and it finally imposed on itself why because the military adventure ism is so costly your roads are not maintained your public libraries are school you're you know the crown jewel of American democracy or is our public school system\nAnd we are watching it be destroyed ...\nAnd so as you follow the country out from the inside\nYou use the harsher forms of control which I spent Twenty years reporting on on the outer reaches of empire militarized police suspension of civil liberties wholesale surveillance revoking basic rights like due process\nMilitarized drones\nHow near you\nAnd and that's how empires go down so yes the military adventure ism is important but it's just a piece\nAnd we've got to stop personalizing this issue around Trump we've got to stop thinking that the Democratic party is going to cough up some magic Kennedy and the Christian right my study of the Christian right was called American Fascists the Christian right in the war in America\nI was trying to reach out to them and I'm\nBill Moyers did not want me to use the word fascist and I actually when I finished the two years of reporting I sat down with Robert ... wrote anatomy and fascism and Fritz Stern who wrote the politics of cultural despair and left Germany as an Eighteen year old two of our greatest scholars on fascism and I was with them for several hours\nAnd I just threw everything I had found and I wanted them to\nBe able to argue me out of using that word\nAnd I at least to my mind they could not\nTell me what's wrong with this sort of idiot definition of fascism fascism the ... in a binding of cheese in stands for the unification\nOf war making power police power opinion making power that the electoral\nMachinery churches media the\nWhole thing in one to my mind God Knows what's ahead but in the this way go back to the Iraq War\nThat was all of\nThose institutions bound together unanimously that was pretty bad and still\nYeah but Chris ... it was different so as bad as it was and we can't divorce the war\nFrom the re configuration of the society into a corporate oligarchy we have the largest social inequality\nIn American history worse than the gilded age ...\nAnd so the war is part of a peace I mean why are we still at war in Afghanistan the Taliban controls more territory in Afghanistan then when we went in Seventeen years ago why because north of Grumman Raytheon Halliburton they're making a fortune\nIt's propelled forward\nBy the primacy of profit\nAt the expense of everything else why are we expanding NATO which doesn't make any sense why are we expanding NATO to the Ukraine\nWell because and and let's not forget that Reagan had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded beyond the German borders after the unification of Germany why because it's a billion dollar industry\nI was just in Poland I got up the airport there's a giant billboard from ...\n... because if you have to re can figure the old Soviet Bloc military machine to make a compatible with NATO\nSo over and over and over it is about the primacy of profit over what's rational over and and we haven't even spoken about climate change these people are driving us closer and closer\nAnd we're pretty close to the extinction of the human species because of the mania for profit and this is ... I mean the great transformation which was a book on unregulated capitalism let me just on the Christian right so\nRight what happens is the moment the dollar is no longer the reserve currency because it has an artificial value in essence because of that\nThe moment that it has dropped than the empire has to contract because we can't pay for it nobody wants to buy treasury bonds the value of the dollar drops imports become extremely expensive\nAnd what I worry and you know I Would add the fact that our financial system is once again being grossly mismanaged by Citibank and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo and everyone else what they've done since the two thousand a crash is\nBen handed by the fed out of electronic ether according the University of Missouri their estimate twenty six trillion dollars truly\nAnd what have they done with it they haven't as China did rebuild the infrastructure and create jobs invest in the real economy\nThey have taken that money and\nUh use it to buy back their own stock that's why the whole idea of the overheated stock market as a sign of economic health is nuts\nThey hoard it or they've gambled with it so the times had a story I guess a couple of weeks ago about the next\nDot com bubble being the fracking industry because like the dot com industry the fracking industry is based on projected profits not actual fracking in fact there's a huge money loser\nThe two hundred and eighty billion have been invested in fracking so the money was given to them it virtually zero percent interest but it has to be repaid\nSo what have they done they've gone to the beleaguered population and impose harsher harsher forms of debt peonage it's why even if you have medical insurance you're getting all these new costs and co pays and that's why we have one point five trillion in student debt is why we have Thirteen trillion in personal household that\nUm and it's why cities and I open the book in Scranton are facing insolvency and so I open the book there where they're selling off municipal assets their pension funds have dropped forty percent because of the crash of two thousand and eight\nHe's in a desperate effort to stay solvent but then they don't have anything left to sell so my fear is that the system the Malay the enemy is so widespread the pathologies of self destruction\nIncluding suicide aren't epidemic but we live in a period of relative stability but with a financial\nWhich is coming it's going to come I don't know when but it's coming and with the dropping of the dollar as the world's reserve currency\nThat financial crisis\nAnd all of totalitarian movements rise to full fluid and out of a crisis because our movements have been destroyed our press has been quoted or democratic institutions don't work then I worry that the monsters are really come out thank you I Want to\nGo deeper into a sort of the last point you were making\nOn uh from Detroit and you know you're always kicking someone out there in from an area where nine out of tune young black men end up in prison and I was the one who didn't like them so we went to college and University of Michigan or start a company and so as long as the social and some of my endeavors I've noticed that I'm often the only young black guy in the room and especially from a neighborhood like minds\nI feel like in some ways Austin and the social justice through says we frame will system as if it's more powerful than the people on one of those people who's always ... you know you can\nCome you know through your circumstances so I'm trying to put the power into the people in their potential and not necessarily in the system but I I Would just say for sort of marginalized communities members and service was of the so the problem in\nMarginalized communities is\nA structural problem and\nAs they carried out the kind of corporate coup d'etat which\nReally began in earnest under factor and Reagan they've changed the whole paradigm started hall writes about this you didn't look to government anymore governance of the famous Reagan line you know government is not the solution is part of the problem and ... hall writes quite stupidly they told the beleaguered white working\nClass that there was an assault on their national identity and the Clintons rose to power on this people forget but\nJesse Jackson's rainbow coalition was dismantled by the Clintons who are using coded racist language and wanted to out law and order the Republicans Biden\nWas a big factor in this so it was actually the Democrats that accelerated mass incarceration from about seven hundred thousand under Clinton to by the time he was out two million now half of the people in our prison system were never charged with physically harming another person\nThe other thing Clinton did they destroyed the courts Ninety four percent of the people in prison never had a jury trial and the students I teach with the longest sentences are the ones who went to trial unfortunately they trusted the system but the system makes an example of them because as Michelle Alexander points out if\nEveryone went to trial the system would crash it's built on plea deals\nSo one of the things that always breaks my heart in the prison is and and it's one of the reasons I teach in the prison is that the structural racism\nWhich is so pronounced as to\nMake it as you know from Detroit almost impossible to make a living in the legal economy\nHas effectively\nSold a lot of these people this idea that it's your fault you made mistakes you know August Wilson had a great line he said all the great black warriors in this country are in jail because when the society denied them the ability to get what they needed for their family they just found another way to get it\nPart of the corporate state to deny they always talk about stem you know it's all vocational to deny what I Would call an education to the oppressed\nTo hide the fact that these structures of power are designed to destroy their lives you know from Detroit you lock up\nThe men and you visit the women and children and that's what happens on why because if if you ... are a victim in on the average is every six months in a poor community you finally the third or fourth time you're a victim you don't talk to your neighbors because you know you're going to be a victim\nIt's why they make it so unpleasant when you visit a prison and\nThe children are terrorized I mean there's no other word for it and people stand out in the rain for hours without bathroom facilities 'cause they don't want their terrified of any unity the most stew political class in America\nAre African American they are the one class that tends to actually understand what their interests are which is why they're all being raised from the voter rolls including by the Democratic party so my feeling is\nAnd this comes out of Rosa ... why like very much lemons only intellectual equal and which Lenin would admit she was right where Lenin was wrong luck someone would say yes you have to do what you do we have to address hunger we have to address despair but at the same\nTime we have to educate and so I Would say yes what you're doing is fantastic unimportant but at the same time consciousness consciousness consciousness and you know there was nobody better to start with Malcolm\nHi [noise] when I was in grammar school we went through drills for what we would do if there was a nuclear Holocaust and some of us in the room probably remember we\nUsed to joke about it and say you sit down and you put your head between your knees and you can you're asked to buy and there is a certain aspect of all of this that made me remember that\nWhat would you suggest is already happening now or that we could start that you personally find promising in addition to overthrowing corporate\nWell I write about it at the end the last chapter is called freedom and\nI was at Standing Rock\nI actually gave a talk in Boston a couple of years ago and all of the activists because there was a pipeline running through Boston and they said you know we've gone to our elected officials we've done petitions I said no what you have to do is go out and buy junk cars\nAnd when the construction equipment comes in to build a pipeline you've got to drive all the drunk cars to block everything and take the batteries out and walk away\nThat's the kind of stuff we got to do it's the activists who got on the railroad tracks in the north west to stop the bit of an tar sands fuel that's what we got to do\nAnd they will be vicious as they weren't Standing Rock mean Standing Rock was an important event for me because it had the spiritual element that Chris is bringing out that I think is key and it's what Reinhold ... madness sublime madness of the soul\nHave to stop asking ourselves if we will succeed we have to enter into the realm of faith that what we're doing is right\nThis society is wonderful about you know internal you are but we have
