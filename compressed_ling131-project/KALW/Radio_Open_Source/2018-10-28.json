intact welcome back Steve tens of you wrote a book that I loved most of the ten years ago called reset about rearranging our our friends in the middle east is this the moment\nWell that book ... you're right might have been a little ill timed it seems now it'd be more relevant even than it was when I wrote it my idea in that book was to posit the thesis that actually\nSaudi Arabia doesn't make a good fit as a partner for the United states Iran makes a good fit this is so contrary to ah the stab list wisdom in the United states that I think it's difficult for some people do a similar but the fact is first of all\nWhat do you look for when you are looking for a country with which you on a partner you want a country whose society is somewhat like your own\nAnd you'd like a society whose government is pursuing geo strategic goals that are more or less in a ... in coalition with yours ... there were similar to your own so that does not fit\nFor Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian society of nothing like American society we all know this is a place where women can't drive or vote a it's a giant prison as my Saudi Arabian interpreter\nTold me one day as we were walking around Riyadh um so the society is totally different from ours Iranian society on the other end is very much similar to the United states highly educated very mobile middle class Internet penetration a very sophisticated culture going back many many centuries\nNumber two when it comes to geo political interests\nSaudi Arabia has been the principal promoter of all the terrorists forces of the United states has been facing for the last quarter century\nWe know that even American leaders are aware of this we have a famous telegram from ah the wiki leaks a trove from Hillary Clinton saying most of the money that supporting al ... and all those similar groups it's coming from Saudi Arabia\nMeanwhile Iran is even more against al Qaida and ISIS and that jihadist ideology than we are because those people want to kill every Iranian\nSee we gotta we gotta deal with this cognitive dissonance or just makes no sense and are being a\nSecretary of state Pompeo is just out in ... magazine for you know ... is useful old cheat saying that ah it's called confronting Iran\n[noise] [noise] oh I think a shuffle is definitely going on what is most notable is the central absence of the United states\nFor many of these equations I'm a turkey and Iran are finding common cause in the Turkish needed for energy as Iran has squeezed by American sanctions\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia or back to their old rivalry within for leadership within the Islamic world turkey aligned more or less with the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia against it in the region fishers between\nNeighbors like Saudi Arabia and cut her have now become deep rift um be hard to repair and of course the Saudi Iranian rivalry has reached that level they never did before and author Israel is now for the first time\nAn overt partner with a major Arab country\nOn a foreign policy project namely regime change in Iran if you look for an external actor you will find Russia or not the United states as the dominant diplomatic influence ... vote in the region Mr protein has a weak hand but he has played it very very skillfully\nSo the Reshef what was going on is basically are without much if any American strategic control or input and that means that the region is quite unpredictable\nYou talked about the possibility earlier of a a war with Iran yes that's what I learned that war would\nBe spearheaded by Israel which would act in such a ways to drag the United states into it and the Saudis would probably cooperate in it but the main driver would be Mr Netanyahu and his his military\nWrote Mr Bolton dumped on side\nJohn Bolton has never were met a war he didn't like and um and he has been passionate against Iran and his passionately for Israel so there you have the connection to the White House\nThe allows actors in the region whether Israeli or Saudi 'em to manipulate American policy\nSo it's going to happen ...\nThere's a great answer and Arabic to that ... God Knows\nJust bringing makes it plain for us as\nSara Lee which is the human rights watch I on the middle east and North Africa for the last decade and more you know ... he says Mohammed ... is a scary departure from the Saudi royalty he used to know what's your view of envious\n[laughter] well I think ... are accurate and describing him as scary everything that I'm ... Mann is doing domestically inside the country are generally a and a extra territorially far away from the country's borders is very very scary\nUm and I think that in um several generations of Saudi leaders uh Mohammed bin Salman is uniquely scary because he has concentrated power in a way that we've never seen before in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] you know how did he get the reformer tired I mean so women ... to drive cars they might even go to the movies on a weekend or when I see is repositioning real labeling Saudi Saudi ... under the age of oil in the age of\nNew new industry in high technology ah\nRedeem him in their eyes after all this [noise] and somebody else to do that rule\nWell I I mean there's no doubt the decision to allow women to drive was very positive one and one that I think has extremely broad support in Saudi Arabia where more than fifty percent of the population is under the age of thirty and\nSo he was right to know that the er aggressive policy the kingdom a you know from a ... of the kingdom banning women on driving for example\nI'm a ... an ending that would meet with much support\nOr however he has very deliberately taken that measure and other uh liberalizing measures let's say like a a reopening movie theaters\nOr in the country in a way that makes clear that he decides and nobody else has a say in fact he's very liberally jailed a activists including women's rights activists who campaigned for the women's rights\nTo drive sure and that's because he wants them to have a very clear message that only he gets to decide what changes in the country\nAre envious so made a sort of still visit the United states including\nHarvard and MIT and that their presidents or what not many\nDoesn't key billionaires in this country as well as on drum how did he get that notion and how did he get the assignment in to be part of this alliance anti Iran alliance with Trump with Israel\n[noise] well when you look at and Samantha such a from deputy crown prince as the favorite son of king ... non uh to basically carrying out a coup against Mohammed bin Nayef the man who was crown prince\nUh in Saudi Arabia but also interior minister in Saudi Arabia for many decades and who had extremely close ties with the Pentagon and the CIA and the state department for many decades\nUm habit than men was able to come in and elbow a cousin out of office at the gate and acceptance and approval or in the Washington establishment establishment because he was deliberately marketed as such a and and\nMy home to be accepted by the way he and by Israel uh men do I should say\nThe supporters of Israel and the very very strong support that he received the partnership a he had with leading voices and leading figures particularly from the ... but also from Israel um led to his emergence as a force\nUh in the United states and and the quid pro quo I think has been very clear\nAh in that he has been very much a all aligned and and for the first time publicly aligned with Israel are talking about having a relationship with Israel that has never before it happened um but also are not coming out against\nA Jared Kushner's so called now dead of course peace plan a as well just remain silent on the move of the embassy to Jerusalem\nWho who was the only who's gonna who has a say now from the CIA to Israel to the royal family as to whether he stays or goes after this this\nAwful to show the murder\nWell it's it's it's I ... you know it's a known who can make a change um the problem is that even if king says nine and a wanted\nTo change his son from power he is widely reported to have dementia and have very limited moments that city so whether he\nIs wearing off of the crisis that his son his thoughts of the country into a\nAnd has the capacity to move him out of office and replace him that's a big question mark on the next capacity for change might come from other royal prince says other other power centers in the country who Mohammed bin Salman has alienated in his ... is\nA central location of power and ruthless a attacks jailing a defunding of everyone else\nIn the country who might be a threat to him um for all those who might want to change and if there's some kind of an internal Saturday cool a it may well succeed if it has the support of the United states\nCertainly but since then by Steve Simon joins us from Amherst College among Middle East policy wonks you're known Steve is the real one with the deep back on and the religious cultures in the region\nThe time it was the rock Obama's Middle East men on the national Security Council last I heard you were working on a book titled the long goodbye United\nStates in the middle east from Islamic Revolution to the Arab Spring where are we now\n[noise] [laughter] well [laughter] you know I I think is as far as the one who lives keep going well and\nI have a perspective since the prospect of British as a was saying before I think quite quite rightly the United States isn't much of a presence here in this equation\nUh and uh I think that's part of a boy or a general trend of the United states distancing itself from the region because um\nYou know American presidents she a less of a payoff for American intervention were involved than uh than had been the case and not only that for us you know once I think is is less welcome has been in the past\nBut you know American removal yes and no I mean Donald Trump does it his way he's in his daughter to the relocation in the U.S embassy he sent his son in law to have who knows what kind of discussion with these people that's not quite abandoning the field you know what I Know\nOh no no and I don't mean to say that the United states\nDescribe this war and I have to say we're all embarrassed not to know more about it there's an embarrassment to our journalism right there but tell us what you know who's\nWell think well thank you for having me on the show and also thank you for recognizing not because it's been a really a long struggle for us for the last three and a half years to try to shed light on this issue given its um you know incredible told that it's taken on so many millions of human beings lives in Yemen\nAre about Yemen is um you know Saudi Arabia southern at Saudi Arabia southern border it is um the middle east poorest country and um has seen a lot of upheaval especially after the twenty eleven uprisings that took over in various parts of the Arab world including him and\nUm and unfortunately we are here today because some of the Saudi intervention that began in twenty Fifteen and has now lead to creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen\nUm two going a picture what kinds of people what livelihoods no oil I take it I'm\nNo oil which is why you don't hear about it very much um but the previous president of a thirty three years in Yemen was a strong ally of the U. S. and I'm a you know under the Obama administration the drone wars began in Yemen extensively to to read the country of ...\nUm and after the President Assad to step down I'm following the twenty love in protest\nUm has vice president was placed as interim president for two years his term expired and he was given an extra year and after that expired as well\nIt was a lot of people in the country they were still calls for our constitution injury drafting the constitution Yemen unlike its neighbors is not a salt in it it's not a a kingdom it's not a\nAn ... um you know there's it's fair to have a democracy in Yemen\nAnd unfortunately that was some co-opted from the people and a civil war began um largely you know people trying to vie for power seeing a I'm a ... a power shift was taking place in Yemen but you know all of this ... we we hear about Yemenis\nHow is it a civil war and\nNow she's also there's also pictured as a\nAn Iranian adventure to and then what has to be confronted is it or isn't it\nAbsolutely not this is what's how to review has been saying about Yemen to says what they've told Americans and apparently the Americans seem to still believe it I just said you your guest Steve Simon talk about their interventionist policy in Iran and how\nThey were the Obama administration was convinced that this was a a good way of dealing with Iran in Yemen and we know that Iran is not in Yemen\nYemen is located at a strategic location which is the point I'm at the streets of ... where about four million barrels of oil traveling every single day of course there is a strategic importance there for the Obama administration to protect\nAnd frankly the Saudis told them that this was going to be a very quick war they called a decisive storm they expected it to and within a couple of weeks maybe a month or so at most they didn't expect any kind of resistance in the country they didn't expect that this country that this conflict to John for so long\nBut you know here we are three and a half years later the Saudis have blockaded the country Lansing area which is why millions of people are literally starving to death yet we're expected were expected to believe that the Iranians are somehow\nManaging to smuggle weapons there's no evidence of that um there's no Iranian presence on the ground is is not Syria um and like your first guest Stephen I'm ginger mentioned this is a very much a one sided war\nSurely wants to return I'm Wondering for you at human rights watch somebody has made the construction suggestion that the least\nThe crown princes do as parents would have to stop that war tomorrow what could stop it actually\nWell absolutely I mean Saudi Arabia could stop the war Saudi Arabia is the primary aggressor in this war though it hides behind a coalition and Saudi Arabia started this war in Yemen\nUm agree completely with the commentator a previously that this was a fantasy that would be a war of a couple of weeks\nAnd the only real reason that this war we started was so that young crown prince could justify his new title is minister of defense or someone who actually had an experience fighting and winning a war in fact he's shown and proven himself to be the opposite of qualified for that\nWar and it read that resume were absolutely except if anything this is the resume that prove\nWhy not only he should be fired but he should be jailed I mean Saudi Arabia has been carrying out\nThe most atrocious war crimes\nOr in a a Yemen a bombarding uh schools universities hospitals are using cluster munitions littering the the the the country uh and I must also emphasize it primarily using American and British weapons\nAnd the role of America in this war is not just to sell weapons or or even to you know generally vaguely support a Saudi Arabia in the war the United states is the party to this war the United states is actively providing refueling assistance\nHas actively provided targeting assistance obviously very bad targeting assistance and so whatever is happening in this war the United states is a party to it a complicit in it and is responsible for\nThe uh of violations little love and war the war crimes that are taking place and and and just to go back to to to your commentator Mr Simon's comments\nUnfortunately uh the the support for the war in Yemen is by far the greatest foreign policy failing\nOf the Obama administration and it's it's really quite ...\nWas signed by the Yemeni people\nSee Simon strange until the Republicans in Congress who who hate this war against Yemen um what what's the possibility of mobilizing American opinion and government opinion and government power against it\nI think that there's this looming possibility that a ... a murder\nOr will prompt\nCongress or injured bean and and and do something to bring a U.S assistance to the ... war effort to an end and at the same time to put diplomatic pressure\nOn the show to use in the ... to support a un brokered peace process in Yemen there's a slim chance of that I'm\nA I'm skeptical that the Republicans are will be able to mobilize a coalition on the hill a really to make that\nWork and it's not something that can be done quickly either because it would probably panic or some kind of legislation so um you know it it it wouldn't be a miracle cure even if it happened and I think the chances are slim but there is a chance\nTo hinder um get us out of that war somehow\nI think it's true as you heard earlier that the United states wants to be less involved in some ways in the middle east and we don't have a ambassadors there that's a perfect example but let's not take from that phrase the idea that we're somehow disconnected from this war I Want to emphasize what you just heard\nWithout the United states this war couldn't be going on we are providing the targeting assistance on the refueling\nSo we are involved in some ways in a worse and more and a deeper way than we have been in the past because we're involved through others over home not only we have no control but we over we desire to exercise and no control the worst piece of this is that this war really is not about Yemen\nNobody cares about Yemen it's just the battle ground and and having lived through other wars like the one in Nicaragua which had nothing to do with Nicaragua just required Nicaragua's to supply the dead people so outside forces could make their point that's what's happening in Libya and in a in Yemen\nUp and asked for the fact that a Yemen was the worst foreign policy disaster of the Obama administration it certainly looks that way now but if you're from Libya or Sudan or Syria you could see that there's a lot of competition the\nSeason and it's not about you know what is it about\nThen I think it's about Saudi Arabia's desire to show that it can crush\nEvery she uh influenced movement which will then described as being pro Iran Saudi Arabia has tapped into an obsession in America with Iran\nJust like the way so many dictators tapped into our obsession against communism and they use that obsession as a way to get themselves permission to do whatever they want we have convinced ourselves to such a degree about the evil of Iran\nThat were able to look away from even the kinds of horrific crimes that are unfolding in Yemen\nBecause we've developed this idea that this as this force of Iran at so evil we have to ... we have to get out of that obsession before we can begin to look at its manifestations\nCheering on any speaking for him and it begins to sound from the outside like ... a genocide of war we're just going to wipe out the population by starvation if nothing else um what do they what did the Yemeni need most relief from the from from bombing from attack",
