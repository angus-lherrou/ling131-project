it and it's true\nVery like Douglass is ideal of\nPosit nation\nDavid bites accounted Douglas use the word man like Melville\nA storyteller who keeps rewriting his autobiography re composing here's an ethic\nOf American identity of tragedy of evil\nThe character Douglas is creating let's say in the narrative the first autobiography and even more ritually in the second is a self willed horrific individual ... always working and striving against the odds and he had great up\nHe is a courageous young man who sees is upon words ... language I'm literacy as his weapon as his only weapon but I think he's also creating a character who seizes on the weapon of character of\nA strong personality and even the young man who would use physical violence to regenerate himself\n[noise] we could do this hour in just personal relationships but the first one that grabbed me was we would call the yeah slave break or you know they were on on the eastern shore of Maryland He had been born into slavery\nGets farmed out to Thomas All right who finds them a little too rough and ready and he packs a monster movie\nAnd they end up in a fight which is all differently in different autobiographies but it's critical\nYeah it is critical critical Douglas the self creation but Douglas tells the story that one day on a Sunday when he had returned from temporarily running away to the woods he stood up to Kobe and according to the dog was they fought for two hours now I don't believe it lasted two hours a day to kill each other\nBut Dugas stands up with his fist and fight them off\nAt the age of Seventeen\nNow in any other circumstances a slave who resisted as master and such a way would be prosecuted or hang a or at least sold south\nBut at this point co via kept quiet according to Douglas because Kobe's pride was at stake and at the end of this year with Coby ...\nHis owner Tom his old hired him out again to another master a different farms just some five miles away that man's name was William Friedland\nAnd when you first read Douglas you think he's making up these names that sounds like Toni Morrison characters and but that was ... his name and Freeman's farm in fact the farmhouse on freelance farm is still there but it was on ... as far as the year after standing up to ... with his fists\nUh he wasn't even in his mid twenties and he could hold an audience for an hour and a half and half I'm laughing and crying\nThat was power\nThe only power he had\nSpeaking about that gays [laughter] I feel that gays\nAnd so many pictures every one of them striking storytelling expressions\nYeah they are everywhere he went\nDivers one and wanted him to sit for photographs he also cultivated these photographs over and over he liked doing this and uh if you didn't like the profile the photographer took in the morning and go back in the afternoon and get it done right [laughter]\nUm Douglas headed visit she had a president she had an incredible charisma\nAnd one of the things I found many many many\nAccounts of more people in the press or in letters describing\nThe first time they saw the first time they heard Douglas speak or or the second time they heard Douglas and comparing it to the first there are many descriptions of the sounds of his voice his mannerisms style and so forth\nAnd this was we need to remember the golden age of oratory or if they're photography and the birth of photography\nAnd Douglas love mode during the day by the way you love the things that ... and it's worth ...\nKind of remembering that he is born Eighteen Eighteen before steamboats the railroad\nThe rotary press which he will use of course to great extent\nThe telegraph all of the these these elements of Nineteen century mowed down to the which made possible a massive and you know reform movement like anti slavery that was born before that even happens but he lives all the way to electric light bulbs\nDid it might come to Eighteen fifty two and a speech\nThat is now sort of classic and a lotta young kids know that the fourth of July speech\nMaybe his great masterpiece maybe his popular masterpiece for all the time\nThe fourth of July speech Douglas gives an Eighteen fifty two is in my opinion the rhetorical master piece of American abolition and uh one of the great speeches in American history it's now canonized in lots of collections of oratory and speeches and even literature\nAnd read it street corners on red is already corners of the state of\nVermont has a ... as a statewide policy on the fourth every town is supposed to read it but the speech itself the context is\nIn part everything [noise] it's summer of Eighteen fifty two times\nIt's a presidential election year it's two years into the attempted enforcement of the fugitive slave act they're rescues going on around the country several of them already Kirk Douglas has participated in two or three of them [noise]\nThe crisis over slavery is beginning to break apart the political parties and Douglas gets indicted by his friends in Rochester the ladies anti slavery society of Rochester New York\nTo give a speech in Corinthian hall which was this big beautiful new hall in Rochester\nSet about six hundred people [noise] place was packed\nAnd ... there's a letter and which Douglas tells us he worked harder on that speech than anything else you'd ever written except\nPerhaps the narrative I said he spent three weeks but the speech is I call it a symphony in three movement is an opening\nUp six pages or so or he sets his audience cities in a calm voice she talks about the founding fathers as geniuses to declaration of independence is the ring ... says of your independence is a celebration for six pages or so\nAnd then the pronouns rain down on your you you you\nYou're dresses his audience the audience in that room that day but this piece was addressed the nation he already headed printed up ready to take on the road\nTo sell for probably fifty cents a copy the second\nMovement of speech which is the whole middle of the space for the longest part of the speech comes after he says but pardon me why have you invited me here to speak on your fourth of July the fourth of July as yours you may rejoice I'm much more than\nYou you you you you do not meaning white America does not include me and my people\nIn this celebration what ... uh well those I represent to do with your national independence\nYou're high independents only reviews and miserable distance between us the blessings in which you this day rejoice\nOr not enjoyed in common\nThe rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independents decreased by your father's is shared by you\nNot to buy me\nSomething like that ... life in the evening to you as broad stripes and death to me this fourth of July is was\nKnocked my you may rejoice a much more than\nTwo drug a man in factors into the grand Newman needed temple of liberty and call upon him to join and Julius and things were human mockery and sacrilegious I really\nDo you mean citizens to mock me by asking me to speak today\nAnd in the middle part of the speech he takes them through the historical Whitney of the slave trade\nThe whole of a slave ship he makes he appeals to their senses\nHe tells them what it smelled like he tells them what it sounded like and then he makes them listen and hear the sounds of the chains on a slave and the sounds of a whip he tells him to see the blood dripping off the back of a of a slave being savagely beat and it's like a hailstorm\nThrough the whole middle\nOf the speech for twelve pages\nThat section comes to an end with the passage that is one step better than John\nYeah he ends with the image of a terrible reptile colonial up at the nation's heart and the boat to eat out you're hurt\nUnless you were pent you reform you change and then comes to slash short part of the speech\nIt's calmer it's as though he's handed out towels and let everybody dry off\nAnd he says but your country is still ... still young and male ... it is still possible to save ourselves by ending slavery destroying the system and recreating the nation\nAnd of course the speech ends so richly ironic\nWay of uh the verses of a song palm written by when lord garrison go sound the jubilee and the fact that he would do that in Eighteen fifty two right after he just had this horrible personal breakup with garrison\nIs ritually ironic so it's a speech that is full of the terror of of the great puritan Jeremiah by with the possibility of redemption at the end of it\nI suspect it's read today and used today so much partly just because of the power and beauty of the language but also it's used in places where people want\nAudiences they want their neighbors they want their friends to think about the fourth of July of something other than just fireworks and hamburgers and celebration they want to think think about its history I think about where Americans have come from I think about what we had to overcome\nTo have a peaceful republic such as it is and no one ever put it better than Douglas did by saying your country will be destroyed by slavery unless you repentance save it now and it might even be destroyed anyway\nNow that comes out of Douglas's deep intellectual moral emotional ties to the Old Testament store right that's where that comes from and in fact the language Douglas employs especially in his oratory\nBut also in a lot of his writing is really right out of the king James language [noise] David Wright cutting to the great relationship of perfect drug laws and\nAbraham Lincoln mhm historic ... obviously and endlessly\nReview of all they had studied one or the carefully warily at multiple levels of politics and character and strategy before they met and then you I didn't know that he met Lincoln\nVirtually by by urging into the White House to the favorite seekers yeah mine Lincoln receipts him though he was uninvited and according to ... percent\nMr Douglas I Know you [laughter] I have read about you are not seen that they're going to be that you want to think that Lincoln was on an equal pay for the black soldiers in the union army right take us there and these two men\nSure when we went to the White House as you suggest on his own elbow to Israel up the stairs got in line with us away andme gave is card and said please let man and Lincoln apparently did get the message that said send him in the head of a bunch of white people\nWell first of all Douglas was in every way of women's rights man you're and wrote an essay by that title I am a women's rights man\nHe was the only black at the Santa Claus convention and aging forty a he was the only primary males speaker at to Seneca Falls convention he signed a declaration of rights he put a new mass started on this paper which said rages of no color nor sex\nAnd he had a very strong relationship with the leaders of the ones suffered movement and his neighbors who isn't being ... in Rochester right whether neighbors now for the purpose of tourism\nAnd they weren't really neighbors they live their uh their neighbors and a statue even know the truth is he was very close to lots of women's rights activists he traveled with him he spoke with them because some of them with the same suffer just an abolitionist\nAnd during the civil war as many people know the women's suffrage movement by and large folded their tense and fought for black freedom Stanton in fact wrote one of the greatest eulogies all ... she's the one who\nSaid he was quote majestic in as raff which is great phrase Anthony was what Doug was a day died Dugas attended a women's rights convention in the last day of his life in Washington DC and he sat on the stage and he sat next to Susan answered and then he took care of ... dropped dead of a heart attack and six PM\nBut he had far more women friends among these reform movements then he actually did male friends\nIn some ways it most delicious piece in the relationship with Lincoln and Douglas comes ten years later when mhm Douglas dedicates rush free men's monument in Washington DC\nIt's a statue and we have one like it or a flicker right here in Boston standing Lincoln his left arm raised over the new black man and taking a knee if I may say I mean a man it's not quite kneeling but Douglas recoiled at that image if you wanted to call it A People's\nMonument right and he began his\nPre eminently the white man's president right and then the speech tension amazing term pores over\nI often say that That's Douglas is sucking the greatest speech\nFor an eye opener for greatness because it just seemed like a moment to place the story right there toward the end of reconstruction was everything at stake that had been in one in the war that speech is really about reconstruction yes and the retreat from reconstruction and know the audience you hit\nThe entire government was their president grant members of the president's cabinet congressman senators members of the Supreme Court ... it's everybody that would be at at a state event that inauguration\nNo black person had ever address that group of lots ... and no black person ever did again into Brock Obama was inaugurated ...\nI have said that President Lincoln was a white man and should the prejudices common to his countrymen tool words the color race viewed from the genuine abolition ground\nMr Lincoln seemed tardy code do and in different but measuring him by the symptom of his country a sentiment that he was about as a statesman to consult he was with cell is radical and determine\nThough Mr Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow countrymen against the negro is hardly necessary\nTo say that in his heart of hearts the lows and hated slavery the man who could say they do we hope fervently do we pray that this might teach school of war should soon pass away yet if God Knows\nIt could take you to all the wealth powered by two hundred years of bondage\nSo have been wasted in each drop of blood drawn by the last show have been paid for by one drawn by the ... the judgments of the lord true and righteous all together gives all needed proof\nOf his feeling on the subject of ...\nIt's an honor speech he says look and this is by the way election year Eighteen Seventy six it's the centennial year year of the American centennial is reconstruction\nGonna last or die is right on the table and it comes in the wake of so much brutal use of violence and terror across the south now for years\nDouglas as Abraham Lincoln was permanently the white man's president he was your president not our you my white fellow Americans were his children I and my people only his step children when he repeats like a ...\nYou read that first part of the speech and you do a kind of an ouch what is the white man's president him being black nationalist diatribe against Lincoln and the country\nNo it's not what he does then he's shifts and he says but\nUnder his rule and in due time and he makes that are refrain three or four times and under his Lincoln's rule and in due time we were liberated\nWe became free we became\nEqual before the law and the fourteenth amendment we got the right to vote in lifting amendment under his rule and in due time which was Douglas's way I Believe\nOf saying the United states freed us the United states gave us our rights and the United states is bound to enforce and protect that and who's sitting in front of him\nAnd it ends with a sort of ...\nAbout reconstruction and about whether this will be saved or not and of course it's also laced beautifully with all that civil religion he talks about\nThe deadline and yonder Arlington he talks about the majestic dome of the Capitol I mean it's full of the sort of beauty of patriotism I see it as a great reconstruction speech because it comes right as reconstruction is falling apart on the evil that presidential election which is of course when\nThe bargain is struck that in effect does bring a kind of political ended least reconstruction is Douglas his attempt at the last two Iran to try to rally his own party now which is still in power\nTo whole reconstruction together\nThe lynching speech was the last of the great ones ... mhm [noise] yeah he's confronted by the issue of lynching from really the late Eighteen eighties on but especially in the early nineties\nI to be well had some influence on that because of her great activism about lynching and they became quite close he became a kind of mentor to her\nBut he first fashion the speech while he was in Chicago representing the nation of Haiti to Chicago world's fair and he took a version of it on the road called the lessons of the hour also sometimes called why as the negro Lynch\nIt's actually a very good analysis of how this came out of the culture out of the society\n[noise] and it's no holds barred it's in Bedford speech it's an ugly speech\nA difficult speech even read at times because he uses examples from the press of of actual lynchings\nHe talks about the white audience celebrating which we've now learned much much more about adult lynching\nBut in essence that speech given in the last years of his life is Douglas saying\nAll that we fought for all the way one the great triumphs and rebirth of the United states is possibly being destroyed now by this phenomena\nHe has a very difficult time in that speech doing what he usually did through his life which is to find some kind of way to end\nOn hope ... but\nHe does it [laughter]\nLike it or not he hands on this faith that still some how the ... of the constitution will prevail ... ... where I was going to go but to the fourteenth fifteenth amendments where else can you go but\nTo these creeds of natural rights which is worried always gone in way back forty years earlier when arguing for the destruction of slavery\nBut it is remarkable that in the end of his life he doesn't in his life an unhappy man by any means a he had a a very rich domestic situation by the end of his life and he was comfortable but what's happening out\nIn society was the cause of great despair and its vividly illustrated in that speech ... lessons of the hour he didn't need to share as\nMuch about his private life is married life first year and a slave woman who did not grow intellectually the way he did or his lady friends or his second marriage all the many children to who had been in the civil war and for over the legacy I mean do we need to know\nYes we do because I think in any biography
