sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem\nThroughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact\nThe mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because\nHow do you even do those experiments the KGB starts assassinating people\nWith rights and which is an extract of the castor bean seed and\nWe did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know\nA poisonous plant garden and that it's been listed as one of them\nI think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter] well I thought that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen in some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manned drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plants including some illegal plants there was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter]\nWhat plants so like I watched maybe you've heard of\nA hallucinogenic plant from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are losing a Jenike plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what the plant does to you\nBlindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nSo I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had those are like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants\nSo I was crying Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication\nIt's a great example if a plant that both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it and tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and\nImpressive looking plan you know yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness\nI was reading something about\nMaybe the night shades have\nInability to hate you think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and that is something that we're finding out more about so one way that plants communicate is through route exited so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone that would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to\nStimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world oh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that\nYou don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators\nIt's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is more healthy and superior\nSo as cyanide so as rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eat\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging metals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery

differences are that people are buying robotic big brothers and sisters as babysitters for their children\nThese can be of any nationality and sort of any any backgrounds you want and and there's a little bit of tension between them and the cloning folks right there are people that are cloning themselves in cloning children\nSo there's a little bit of a kind of whole foods organic movement going

they need to maximize our engagement to maximize their cliques because they get data from that and that's actually the business model of these\nSites they're advertising financed and so they need us

the\nTitle of your book present shock is a reference to advertisers Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense or maybe the the sensation might be similar to the real difference is that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so well Tom Sawyer was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world that was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able to adjust to change itself\nI'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century we became less of a society that was just obsessed with the future and what's next and what's happening what's the next big thing where is it all going\nAnd we became a society that was very much\nIn the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected\nAbout how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living in a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... where you break this idea of present to them down into five big areas and little let's talk about that was one you call ... ... what does this\nWhich is interesting and it kinda comes out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou are the one going through the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice to choice rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line what we're choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of ourself\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for respond to\nTheir view on Facebook who might be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories\nAnd they're so how do you deal with all of these different use running simultaneously that's\nSort of the essence of the digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the digital any a chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin and I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got why fight on in this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be an all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just\nWhining and handwringing about the problems of ... but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital time frames and digital technologies really don't understand time\nThey live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you just because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them\nRight the beauty of digital technology was that it waited you know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we founded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well in the the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it seems like it's just makes us feel crazier\nI really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology for slack which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home in our underwear anytime we want\nYou know 'cause we'll just get our work done and and turn it in as it as it's ready rather than\nGoing to work for this eight hours a day and being always on while you're there what we ended up doing instead was kind of taking that time is money a fish and sea values of the industrial age and translating them onto the digital age where digital technology really if we're going to embrace it the way I think we can\nIt's about really liberating ourselves from these obsolete industrial age priorities and embracing a totally different really way
