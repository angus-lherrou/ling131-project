[noise]\nI said ... was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson he\nCame to Madison well it would have been right after the passing and the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after Thomas Jefferson died he granted all of his children their freedom\nAs was Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn on Mount a cello on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them identified as African American authors passed\nBecause they have like no skill\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia ... wife was also multiracial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identified as mulatto but then after the fugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty\nAshton and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they pass as white and they identified as white they lived among whites and ... and nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continued their life [noise]\nJohn and that really who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at the time of the civil war if you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question\nThat they were white and that they identified that way\nJohn the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shepherd was very successful at it but never married there's some theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin\nThat would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything that really did marry he had sons of his own he said in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchase diverse I'm the best and Madison actually\nSo these children up a former slave became these prosperous\nYeah why they chose Madison one would assume maybe had something to do with the name [laughter] you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nWhen I first heard that one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live\nI was done I mean this is a long way from ... Virginia where Pedro up\nYeah I was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery to bury and one of my co workers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west they're still family members and Michigan still some in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean if you have the son\nOf Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these trends of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little he sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things and I think you can avoid feeling the weight of that here\nMm\n\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOoh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life Sally Hemings and that they had children are Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied\n[noise] and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children even DNA evidence she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award and she tells the policy\nOf this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery\nI think most people in the black community did not doubt it because we understand that this kind of thing happened quite a bit\nAnd so it didn't seem like it was wild and crazy\nI Would say that most historians did not believe it was true and there were a variety of reasons there was sort of an old view well Jeffrey symbols of southern gentleman and this sort of he ... he wouldn't do this there was this sort of\nThat important to them once you put things down and writing you can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is\nThe revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence thing that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what\nWhat do we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem\nThe connection to slavery and we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about\nOr whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape through\nConnections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable\nI think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon no\nThere are things to admire about Jefferson\nAnd we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jefferson bowed Washington at all of them\nThe number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage and profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet\nAnd I don't know\nThat it's ever been good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you I think a better way to look at it is to\nSay this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good and some of them was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that\nWe were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already without a mystic view of race relations didn't eat\nHe was phrases yeah he he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart as when you\nFound that most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really\nAnimated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery\nJust fix this that little thing over there\nBut it's that little thing over there\nThat destroys the thing that you love\nAnd slavery was he came to see the walk upon which the union will be split\nThat was true\nThank you very much is is just\nFascinating history Oh thank you for having me\nHarvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with the false mhm\nFor books Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer Prize at the national

your own genetic ancestry is both black and white African and European\nWestchester University in Pennsylvania and needed phone then leads to DNA discussion project every semester students in her class take a genetic ancestry test\nAnd she says the results can change the stories they tell about themselves and others often and profound way\nSomebody said I think I read an article that said you could trace somebody's ancestry based on their\nDNA and I thought boy I bet that there are a lot of people walking around thinking their backgrounds are one thing and there are different and how would that change the conversation that we had about race\nPicture of this you have a class full of undergraduate kids and they all spit in a test tube and send it away and is there a big unveiling day where they get their results [laughter]\nAnd almost invariably there's something there\nThat is unexpected and people are funny it really runs the gamut somebody will say the test is not right you know tested over but\nAlso start to see that they're connected to people that they did not think they were connected to ... and it's it's really neat\nIn one setting there was a young white guy who had two or three percent Africans background he was sitting next to two African American gentleman and they wanted a high five and any time sort of reflect thing in my high fiving here is this appropriate [laughter] have you gone through your own genetic testing\nI have it took me ten years to do it and I said what would Freud say and indeed found some things I expect it ends up things that I didn't expect like what\nI was surprised how much of European I'm African American I was surprised how much European was in my background twenty five percent European which floored me the most stunning experience that I had was that I went to gone out\nBefore I took the test and as part of that trip we went to a place called the door of no return which is where the slaves went out on the ships and just never returned and so when I looked at my profile I'd significant Guyana and my background and I thought oh my goodness\nOne of my relatives literally probably went through that door and I was surprised at my own reaction\nI've heard other people say that they have been surprised at their own reaction\nSurprised how just how emotional that was for me and I think that that is something that a lot of African Americans\nIt's hard to articulated it sort of a low level anxiety\nJust this tremendous feeling of sadness\nAs a person who has a background in slavery where you were systematically told that you were just not fully human too\nTo face that directly by looking at my DNA\nWas very potent for me\nI just imagine that the they must be such a\nMixed range of emotions you know and the one hand maybe there's some real joy and discovering\nWhich particular parts of Africa being able to really connect viscerally and at the same time you know as you said it it makes that

and\nWhy did you want you to launch includes so much us though content\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the shows right or was that was ground for it number two it it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience\nAnd as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings but they have no explanation for understanding I cited\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry at in the sky\nAnd talks that meeting these giants the yellow team it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you call this if you know going further back in pre the Wright brothers and things they should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experiment\nI mean in the in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with that ferries are elves are in Germany they were ... or ...\nWe're up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and Michael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voices that were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody is small and as insignificant and as stupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThan it can't be random there's got to be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just a sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the world\nExactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nYeah definitely final question what do you think is the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series\nBoy it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched\nIn some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a a lot of people\nIf you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick him cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them in the edge of their seat but to go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and the culture is that it's our job\nTo keep mythology alive for people that it's akin to what ... did and and first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best\nThat's what storytellers do for our culture now\n[noise] and ... with [noise]\n... is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch the true these series the third season of Twin Peaks debuted on may\nOne [noise]\nThis year's Booker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the bar down his complex and multi character novel set during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln's they love it sounded really dies probably of typhoid fever you only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief\nAnd visits the cemetery cramps many times to hold his boy's body\nSteve ... when the book first came out and I began with their reading can you explain\nGoing on in this scene yeah there was a convention in the book that when a ghost sort of Cohen habits the same\n... the person's thought string becomes fully available to the ghost so they're linking has entered the tune and Willie is kind of watching him watching Lincoln fuss over the physical body and spirit willy who's separate is kind of feeling a little jealous and so he kind of just\nPlunges into Lincoln and thereby gets access to Lincoln's thoughts and feelings in that moment\nGo onto the next step so the danger of the ... you can get stuck there\nOr you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably true of my ... than the actual Tibetan borrow but at some point that kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not to have you done it but my guess is that whatever happens it's going to be a real shocker and ah [laughter] and it it is not going to be like oh this isn't just what we were told\nSo so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be but be different enough that we shared and some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel\nJust this resonate for you personally I mean that's more than just illiterate device ... the Buddhist concept of ...\nYeah my wife and I haven't students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know a total beginner but it back and flex this life in the sense that if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild horse that gets let off to tether because now it's not dampen by it\nThey can do anything it can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell if that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a literal afterlife or if that doesn't sushi you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane than the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been how\nOur right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion at ... they're both exercises and world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises yes they are you\nKnow I think in world building especially in a book like this which is ... ... you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically in ton dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is as you do this kind of intuitive approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd in a really magical thing was it you know a ... year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started\nKind of producing weird fruit you know there would be [laughter] turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving that weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be it's a kind of a cliche but I for writer so you know you're like a midwife to book is there\nA perfect being or you know very good being it as a strong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of manage your daily activities so as not to work the thing's individuality and I had that feeling really strongly in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to now\nGet out of Eighteen sixty two and come back to now\nGeorge ... new novel his first it's called Lincoln in the ... and he was talking with Steve Paul from coming up\n[noise] [noise]\nHave told you of things that have happened in the U.S [noise] things that
