has become not routine but not unexpected either ... Alexander Hall is an investigative reporter and she first heard the story when she was working on a pro public art project called documenting hate\n[laughter] we're looking for hate groups in Wisconsin my boss told me about the story the headline was Madison\nPolice investigating possible ambush of proud boy by anti fascist and I thought were the Proud Boys\nSo she investigated and has up to parents the story is not appropriate for children oh\n\nThe Proud Boys are a fraternal organization that's how they described themselves they're a men's drinking club\n[noise]\nWe politically if you've had to nail is on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of his land on the new right they're socially liberal\nFiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that but they think the tradition has some value in this been you know we've thrown off the baby with the bathwater quite literally and uh you know even when they're letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career and blogging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\nOh so you you're right there you're going to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate\n[noise] it seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and now\nLike feminism is obsolete\nIt definitely had a place women needed to vote somebody needed to drive but the pendulum has swung way past that so I Would say feminism was done and maybe Nineteen Seventy nine and since then it's just been woman inventing problems in lying\nLike saying one in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in college are saying that women earn less than men\nDo you think that those statistics about sexual assault and the wage gap is just that it's not true\nWell I don't think you've looked it up if you think they are\nAnd that makes me think why do you care which makes me think you don't care which makes me think you need to find a man you need to focus on creating an shaping lives because you don't sound like that tiny percentage that we'd better off in the workforce I think you'd make a great mom you're clearly curious\nI don't even know what to say about that [laughter] what did you think\nI thought it was a distraction I thought it was strange that he was making it personal want to be curious about the quality of the schools your kids are right\nIf you look on line I feel like a lot of the Proud Boys blog posts that they write are pretty as fences scene borderline angry\nAt women yeah don't you think about feminine and\nI just think it's [noise]\nIt's taken so much away from the traditional family\nThat is kind of contributed to the degradation of\nThe American family as a whole in\nSeeming to be anti [noise]\nKnow they always had these mean\nWent in on the right women on the left and the women on the writer like platinum blonde mad guy hat super sexy look in twenty something year old girl\nAnd then on the last this overweight woman with green hair all had it up with like AT T shirt and it says which would you prefer basically it's kind of like you are you would\n[noise] men and women are Cynthia logically created different\nBecause of their physiological bio chemical makeup\nMen and women are predisposed to gravitate towards different fields\nYou think that's I think I Do think that's the case absolutely to the field or health\nCare for one I think nursing for one that that's one teachers early childhood education and\nEngineering fields math fields\nAre you saying that like men are better than no no\nMy little sisters of biomedical engineer she's great\nI have a lot of ideas about where women would be happy as\nAt home versus in the workplace\nHow's lies are looked down upon\nLike they're not doing enough when\nReally they are shaping live\nAnd what do you think about women [noise]\nThey were very cautious about hey if you don't want to be a housewife cool with us for the housewives you want to be housewives don't look down on it personally\nLove the idea of my wife's the reason why I Love that\nIf I have to be at work in the late at work or somebody there that he can little Timmy to baseball practice or picking Sarah from soccer practice in certain people have\nAttempted to make them feel bad for them and we're doing we're entering the house like not is on a pedestal now that is the scene there is being a doctor my wife was a doctor my wife is a house with\nThe they're to me\nAs far as stature is concerned they have the same way\nToo much of this conversation seems curiously nostalgic you know like ... for the day is when mom stayed home with kids and dad's had\nJobs that they could count on\nYeah it is interesting um you know I don't know how many of the Proud Boys actually believe all of that\n... is a whole nother thing he's sane I Believe Ninety five percent of women would be happier at home you need to go home\nWe want women to be happier we weren't guys just stopped ignoring them in masturbating to porn we want guys to stop treating them like a colossal me back for someone else's you Jackie late you know the feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five\nI think if women have their head screwed on properly they realize that it's these so called sexist who have their best interest in mind we don't want them dumped we don't want them given the milk away for free because we want them to sell the cow\nAnd no for the record [noise]\nWomen earn more than men when they're your age before they make babies they end up earning less over time because they choose to\nWomen tend to choose jobs that are less strenuous less risky they tend to want to go home for their daughter's piano recital rather stay at the office all night and that costs them promotions down the line\nSo the wage gap isn't easy method he bought it takes you honestly sixty seconds\nAnd when feminist harp on it I go yeah you're pretending to carry your virtue signaling and it's a waste of everyone's time it's a pain in my ass\nYou kept your cool remarkably\nMean probably if you had a video camera and the studios during the interview my eyes got wide a few times did you find a source that the ban Batman [noise]\n[laughter]\nStill news do you do you know that Santa's not real\n\nShe's with the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism and Wisconsin Public radio and a couple of things\nFirst if you're curious about the wage gap or does campus rape statistics we posted some links on our website at ... dot org but we just heard the founder of a popular right wing men's group talk about generating women while simultaneously referring to them as cost me bags and cows [noise]\nWe'll talk more about that after this\nI'm answering champs and this is to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise] NPR acts\n[noise]\nThe November midterms will be here before you know and no matter where you live you'll be voting on a bunch of ballot measure KLW wants to help you make the most informed choice tell action date will be airing election treats short summary of state and local ballot measures to get digestible detailed\nAnd learn who funds support and opposes that listens Monday through Thursday just after eight am three PM and just before six and nine PM or browser election breeze at KLW dot org\nChris Hedges and the\nWith a warning Sherman who was suffering so blind\nSpiritual crisis signed a political\nIt's the best of our knowledge I'm an strength champs\nWe're talking about men's issues this hour and reporter Alexandra hall has been telling us about the Proud Boys\nAre right wing men's club with chapters across the U.S the group's founder Gavin McGahn us\nBelieves feminism went too far and that most women would be happier as housewives we're talking about why does views are appealing to large numbers of young white men and to remind you again parents next part of the story includes references to adult sexuality probably not appropriate for kids [noise]\n\nSo what I hear is a couple of things there's there are a lot of phrases like\nYou don't want your ovaries to dry up or you want guys to buy the cow\nMhm you know these references that are I find very demeaning to women but in the next breath he'll tell you that he really generates women and this whole line about generating housewife\n... ... ...\nWhen we come back we're going to put this story and some historical context Warren Ferrell the father of the men's rights movement ... [noise] I'm an strength champs it's to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nAnd the arm [noise]\nWait a day on this American Life or producers always chase was following Senator Jeff flake during the days before the recent Kevin occupying the day of the hearing and after she has stuff that you have not heard elsewhere at one point she was backstage with the center to remember there was straight out of good\nFellows but what are the actual cast members bum Goodfellas strongly encourage gender deflect vote a certain way on the nomination anyway and later today [noise]\nToday at one PM here on Ninety One point seven F. M. K. A. L. W.\nFor walking across campus to the newspaper on the campus newspaper office and I said\nI'm ready for it and they were like untruth a movie review guy [noise] but I was like I'm trying to\nDoors and indignation and like and crossed wires that next time on them off radio hour from\nThat's tonight it's sixty I'm right here on K. A. L. W.\n[noise]\nThe Nineteen seventies was the era of second wave feminists ms magazine Gloria Steinem Betty for them\nBut what a lot of people don't remember is that it also sparked the men's liberation [noise] one of its early leaders was Warren feral author of the midst\nOf male power that look was cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered demands movement a backlash to feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement gave two girls and women was basically said two girls about let's say there's a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job and relatively decent job and the woman because pregnant the woman's has basically to herself I have three options here\nOption one has to be full time involved with my children option choose to be full time involved with my workplace options for you to do some combination of both the men just sort of sits back and he says oh you know I have three options to option on his work fulltime auction choose worked fulltime actually three has worked fulltime\nAnd then if you are is a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to earn money that often somebody else spins while you die sooner I think that's a very deficient definition of power\nThat paradigm so what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what this is a response to it because you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement [noise]\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shouting be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean as as as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage innocent trolls on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is an an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on the Barbara Walters showing the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement is where you have people like Cape mallette who was bisexual this was a number of years ago when this was considered that okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhat do we open our ears to what the women's movement as saying instead of calling them dikes and bra burners why don't we hear their best intent\nAnd that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating when you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies you worked for the national organization for women you are called to Gloria Steinem of men's liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nAnd really the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects um by better for dance second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said\nThat we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying reason that we don't listen to to men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic masculinity is about is men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings not express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though men die sooner\nIf we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nAmended [noise] more and Sarah [noise] he's often called the father of the members will run around the classic mail power [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know boys started getting messages about what it means to be a mom [noise]\nYoung [noise]\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years old you're the man of the house\nYou got to take care of your mother and your sister and your baby brother like at seven\nOh I don't want to go play and he told me that I was like\nWhat does that mean this is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching he noticed that a lot of supplies at his school we're kinda checked out they weren't going to class they weren't doing their work\nAnd the majority of them weren't graduating so shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for ... and in that club he pushed them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a thing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people they're clear that they have a massive they show the world as I think that with a lot of our young men um does idea like let me just so everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic\nIntelligent smart hard you know whatever their characters that they show and then there's that stuff's sometimes there's like people couldn't handle this stuff people couldn't handle knowing that I'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also in our society is that a lot of respect for a man Who's Afraid\nWho sad\n[noise] some of our work is helping our young men have a safe place so that they can talk about this stuff is really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens we'll let 'em urging men\nSo for you personally I mean what what's the mask you grow up for wearing and how to kill adopted at what point did you realize that lets getting your way oh man\nI was a middle schools where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I thought it was kind of smart\nBut in middle school is not cool to be smart and so am I ... I was like getting sliding by whatever I don't care about this in order to do the homework because I didn't want to\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness you know my father died before I was born\nWho you cry at too about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son some school ... where you know when you see your father come to back to school night when you talk to about that like that with my friends couldn't you couldn't talk to them about it\nSo I just had to hold it and I had to pretend like I didn't really exist\nWhat did this teacher city and that changed\nShe had a speech rights she was talking for a long time I don't remember much of it I Do remember one sentence so uh I was like staring at the corner I'm not going to look at it right 'cause if she's lectured me I'm just not ignore her but she said I Know you're sad and that's one reason that are listening because she was like\nWhat you can call me sad I'm a I'm a black board from Oakland I like the one thing I cannot be seen as sad so I looked 'cause I'm about to ... or her statement\nFollowed at eleven by philosophy talk on today's program white privilege it's become a buzzword and discussions about racial inequality and racial justice the called the check your privilege appeals to those privilege to acknowledge the various ways they receive special treatment that others don't\nBut when white people explicitly acknowledge their privileged as this actually do anything to further racial equality find out later today\nIt's to the best of our knowledge from P. R. acts\nEvery now and then life forces you to reinvent yourself [noise]\nSometimes it's [noise]\nI woke up one morning and I was flying in my left eye so of course this was a nightmare for anyone virtually for you regard historian soldier for you guys\nSometimes life throws you a curve sometimes you go on a trip and you discover not who you thought you were\nI didn't get to ... bad for them so I was Nineteen years old\nAnd so what was that like I was African\nWays that are going to say Africa [noise] ...

sitting in the test up listening to public radio putting on Shea butters and they said oh that sounds like a really interesting work\nOkay that wouldn't be my reaction\nBut we're talking about how artists work\nThey kind of let me thinking about how complicated material was its relationship to Africa and an African from West Africa ... shape better it is it's a West African material that\nComes

them are kind of like on sites others are just circles triangles\nBut the steel brands gone to the end to the fore and are heated almost like a cattle brand and then it burns as to the table so this

S. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American was Nigerian it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nAnd in the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the U.S\nToo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time ... ...\nI I've been in the U.S for a twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's never do but you know within those first couple of years\nThere are many things I did not have a narrative for what does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me\nI had to figure out what to think about that but\nAlso what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting and somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks what does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know it took time but my experience of life is as\nIn Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and you do consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home or because that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends of air\nMy books there so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos you buy an English on languages I'm fluent in so there's an at home this\nBut home is also wherever there's Good Wife by\n[laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects me to the world in a way that is it reduced civil and as essential to my experience of the world do you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature is a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed I'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment\nI feel invested in being an American who with other Americans thinks about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other\nWhat do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time and are like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities well the commonalities are very\nSimilar uh it is the experience of ... which is maybe the fourth definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumption is about\nThis conversations have been talking about mhm if somebody says you know gays should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how does somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person\nAble to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan at some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and New York New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale and New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me the the sheer physical scale of New York\nAnd then there's that thing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't lead people in Cairo Johannesburg tell you different\n[laughter] you know it's all live in the name of God this is this is a very strong guy talk yeah later as the place\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold Lagos is the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders are not as they are right now\nI've loved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city which is set in New York kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering\nCould you read that yes thank you a bunch of it is a book of wondering what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was psychological intensity but also those kinds of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant loud [noise]\nShock after that the focus on the relative tranquility as though someone had shutters calm all of sudden private chapel was a blur the TV set [noise]\nI Love my waist crowds of shoppers and workers too little construction on the horn of Africa [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of comment I laid eyes on more people\nWhen I was with customs are seen in the course of the day [noise]\nBeach neighborhood city appear to be made all the different substance\nEach seem to have a difference to pressure\nThe difference psychic weight [noise]\nBright light

the photographs in it on our website AT T T E book dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the middle east [noise]\nSo we're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word for those\nBoxes genres [noise] here's Lauren mucus with a dangerous idea [noise]\nAnd learned here because the author of broken monsters\nAnd my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is westerns and crime novels and they that these are all somehow different and have different values system\nAs far as I'm concerned we should be permitted to it you know reading habits we should take any Dan buck we liked to bed as long as that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know\nSo the idea that we have stories and we have good stories and bad stories and we have stories that use different elements\nBut to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to fit sending criteria it's so frustrating and tedious\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad side fire but it also depends on what your idea of science fiction is it's a very broad stretch at the same with crime you might have already tedious it'll murder mystery which breaks out all the cliches about pretty dead girls and\nThe serial killer creeping up on people and we've seen it before and then you might read a crime novel like Congo which just blows you out of the water\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist we need more hybrid novels we need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read\nCross different genres surprised yourself\n\nLauren ... is author of broken monsters\nNext Charles Monroe can make a former pop singer turned jazz crew in her and she's the light I'm inspired I'm ready to go change the world now and go do it I'll go do it on my soul now has already [laughter]\n...\nAnd it was

Park and all of his outfits that you ever remember from ever video where we're we're hanging there and I I\nBut anyhow that's obviously really hard for me so [laughter] I I looked up and I'm like

then he was like have you ever been to Paisley before and I said no no he's like you want to come check it out oh yeah [laughter]\nSo um I was asking him all kinds of questions and he and he is a super cool and very generous\nAnd then over the years you know we just became friends and he would bring me out on the road and um we wrote together and jammed together and watch movies and he was just very a generous with advice and support and\nYeah can you please for me I just I'm sure the song is going to become a hit I I Would assume it will I ever want to play the for love or were you do
