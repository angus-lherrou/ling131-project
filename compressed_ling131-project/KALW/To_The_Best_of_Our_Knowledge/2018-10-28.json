William justify Bradley\nThis is your app march and she's talking about her father\nFather died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about a father's ghost and how he appeared in the house they grew up in Michigan [noise]\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my mother went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nIn Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry I Would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house she remodeled it\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's coast has been here\nAnd I looked at her like she was a level [noise]\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd this decision or a man or figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there is some man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever there isn't a feared and she went running down the stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it was they do [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan\nI found a picture of my father and his thirties picture my father in the sixties and I sent those pictures to her and she wrote back\nAnd she said my coast is your father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah when I've heard Wilder stories so yeah I mean there are stories of exercises um after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff the IRS the family straight arrow\nI've been around a lot of true believers than I Am not one is probably not an accent that I became a journalist and yet\nStuff all the time why there are some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real without throwing your intellect out the window you irrationality out the window\nWhere do you make it that store without just hang out at impossible you know there's just there's no way one of the most interesting people I talked to was Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism who's Michael Sherman\nHe is a scientist an atheist a regular columnist for Scientific American he has the founding publisher of skeptic magazine I mean he's the guy you'd go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories\nThe strange thing is he has his own story\nWell some of my wife's from a clone Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so [noise] [noise]\n\nThey used to listen to music you meet her and when he died she\nKept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway when she we met and bill of love and so on she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I try to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and it\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know the day of our wedding\nJust particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and\nFriends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house [noise] it's like what was that you know and I thought well I'm a slip my iPhone honor my laptop with high dunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we [noise]\nIt was open the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the rate that plane plane is love song perfectly you know perfectly tune with station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean meant something\nTo her ... her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there with us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good and it did [noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went there the next morning and the debt ever sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nShare my I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of shook him [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences and makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this than I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of idi allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this in Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen\nYou know my friend is not really religious friends with people like deep October that think that there's a you know it's sort of a quantum field that inner connect all of this in a quantum consciousness way he thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or\nWas missing home and the radio didn't come on ... but this was this was your wedding day well it was\nOther I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that the most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable\nLab tested or some kind of way of getting that the experience again and those kind of went off events don't fit that and it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of what ultimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is\nBeyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya Letterman [noise] son to kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at my body [noise]\nPeople see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leaving their body and was around me these experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and\nWhen she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined in\nSo as an apologist you do what the field that you've come to study does no I meant I cast spells I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot of that type of law\nAnd participated in these different groups as they met to carry out their ritual metric\nDid it become real for you or at least at times\nOne of the things I could see was that people experienced the magic Israel and so I I put to the side\nThe question of whether magical force really existed what I could see and what I came to experience is that if you spent time in this world and you did the kinds of things that people did to raise and manipulate natural power you would feel this this forced moving through you\nAnd that happened to you and it did it did [noise]\nA psychic ability I have this odd ability to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere is a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage in history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen that I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was boss the the weathering was raised and it was higher clinics and I didn't know what any of it meant the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a purple robust summertime still when you when you have that image I mean you you take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I'd say that's how he presented himself for me\nSo this all sounds kinda crazy yeah hang in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of a religious you know and not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostic ... I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice\nThat all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it and I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy moving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things these flashes started you know going off\nSo when you say see lights around people without was whether they look like\nWells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I\nEnded up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nI'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was at NYU for twenty five year teaching creative writing my writing yeah I talked play running for very long time and you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge so you're not you're not teaching creative writing and he no I'm not ...\nI'm traveling around the world sitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them in all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with your dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic then that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nSo play that out for America explain that for me if you can when you say you're like a radio and you know you got to sort of tune into the writing channel and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you ... how does that work I mean ... where are you in that where where is Paul ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded I sort of in an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt pertinent and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nSway they really are you are and you're not going out and you know sort of cleaning up the ... year thing these books you know they're not written by you if you're like red lawyer automatic writing and no no\nNo they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed do you think about\nThe metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nDo and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions decay while you're sitting with one right now if you say I'm not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off this conversation has so far out to begin with everybody is the lesson that I Am absolutely thrilled [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group at my apartment had met for Eighteen years with\nAbout ten people who would show but the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guys were talking and they would bring\nThey say well you know you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have through new mayor or is there sort of a\nCommon message [noise] yeah I think\nThat who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a at a transitional points that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity\nAnd how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success what beauty is all of the things that we collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really an inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear and needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic effects different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightening person ... much of my life\nAfraid of what things life yeah life you know I was a sensitive kid you know and I grew up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from\nHelen shook man the woman who was the channel for course miracles [noise]\nShe said I don't believe it but I Know it's true and I can get behind but I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul Salopek he's published five channel tax Steve\nWe started earlier talking about your family and all the stories of family goes to the paranormal has doing all these interviews changed how you feel about your family's experiences and stories\nYeah it has it has um [noise] yeah I take them more seriously\nWe have really good conversation [laughter] when the family gets together because you know we have these mutual interest and we come at it very differently\nAnd uh I'm a speaker and you know I had my own way of doing it and they are secrets to\nBe there's something in common there and it's it's the

sure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nExactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kinda bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training that I for some

we all knew that it was coming close [noise]\nYou know we broke his radio so he couldn't here\nAnd uh [noise]\nWe got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up and\nWe did and he knew [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and [noise]\nFix his hair put his suit on his watch um [noise] he got dress to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down [noise]\nThat was that was pretty intense because you figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he's planning to escape he's going to do it now\nJust cleaning your weapons and making sure everything was a point with her so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean\nNobody when when ... I'm Sorry what ... what did he say to you you personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was very it was very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone no one was going to come and get him [noise]\nHe sort of need to before he walked into the [noise] the deaths house and the [noise] he turned around and say goodbye [noise] and it said that we were all his

professional dignified manner to treat him the way they were supposed to and then it kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution when Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch that [noise]\nI think that I was a [noise]\nI really didn't know what to feel I I've never seen anything like that my wife\nYou know it's just like wow that [noise]\nI mean it was a wild wild west to me like [noise]\nLike I've only seen the

and\nNo one's supposed to hurt him and you just have that\nRuled in your brain and it's easy to influence or twenty two year old\nWhen you see and kicking and spitting on his body [noise]\nI just I just had more respect and the presence of death I guess [noise]\n\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remarks about that [noise]\nThey put this experience I had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why was it that he was able to kill from a distance and almost joke about it off handedly but here we are with essentially the worst of our enemies\nAnd playing a role in that particular death really hurt him in trouble and have [noise]\nI feel like I have to explain why bother me so much for an American to be upset\nBut for us to stand by and let them trigger another human being that way I thought that's what we were over here to stop the treatment like that I truly felt that I was just as guilty as anybody else [noise]\nI've never really had a conscience about anything I've ever done over here as far as humanity goes I've seen some pretty bad things\nThat my job had never before that that I had to stand there and watch people spin on and kept the person's body [noise] and you know what I'm Glad I feel that way I really am if I did feel that way I Would think something was wrong with me\n\nSo would you say that I mean I Want to use this word lightly but are are you traumatized by what happened in ...\nHundred percent um I live with the though those demons everyday but don't get a twisted like he he was tried for his crimes and that is the judgment that they came down with and I'm not saying that he didn't deserve it\nI'm saying

the Nazi on the barber guy named after ...\n\nAnd that some books that was banned in Germany I think the book came out in the early seventies and it was banned for like Twenty years because it looks at the Holocaust from the point of view of a a guy who was a prison guard at a a concentration camp\nOh\nI didn't even know if I like the book but I kept thinking about the book because of the crazy questions that it's a way that it treats the illness that people bring the Baron all kinds of ways in the way we forgive them and don't forget them it's just it's a book that really just sits on your show just won't get off my church\n\nSo I mean it's an easy book to read and to say oh you know there's no culpability for a crime like that I think it's easy to read them you know I could see being German and reading that book and go out to be ... we're not responsible and that the books not saying that at all\nOh ooh\nThe victims are responsible but it's asking that question about culpability
