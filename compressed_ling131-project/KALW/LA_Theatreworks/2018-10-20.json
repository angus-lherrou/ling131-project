a weekly show she left to give up making pictures for awhile\nSays he dons and they want a weekly show I won't have any time make pictures\nAnd that's a big step but it's up to you honey\nDom tell

after what I've been through the last six weeks you've got the wrong Asia\nWith a month or on board everything finally seemed to be falling into place on the ... a month later when just got a phone call from Philip Morris I'd ... milking bill\nHi Milton how has your vacation fantastic jets and the whole time I couldn't stop thinking about I Love Lucy glad to hear it we've all got a lot of confidence in the show a great great that's the spirit is it tell me how sooner you wouldn't be on this is making it moved to Manhattan what I'm [laughter]\nWhere did you the idea we're moving to Manhattan well I just assume you'd want to live in the city but of course if you'd rather commute from Connecticut along I\nNo no no hold on a minute nobody said anything about doing a show in New York We're doing in here in Hollywood with Kenny for the rest of the country\nAre dumping ridiculous of course you're doing it in New York and this is what most of the audience is and they need to see it live not on some lousy Kenneth Scott\nWhat's wrong with Ken is go it's good enough for Edwin and the Allen Young show\nAnd have you seen what the ... of those shows looked like if I Want to kind of crappy picture I could just stare at the window on my wife's washing machine\nNow Milton listen I think they make all the important television shows here in New York\nListen jets I may Love Lucy but I'm also about the fond of my job and I can't buy a show that only Fifteen Percent of the country will see clearly while the other eighty five percent that to watch it with cheese cloth\n... there's been a misunderstanding I Apologize but I can tell you that Lucien does he won't leave California they're raising their family here that's one issue there absolutely clear on I'm\nSorry Janice I really liked the show but if that's the way it's going to be you'd better start looking for another spano\nHold on ... there there's got to be some way for us to work this out let me talk to the network\nUnless it's about laying transmission cable across the Rockies I don't see what good that will do if the and that's his insist on staying in California and uh I might as well drop the program right now and start looking for another property ...\nGive us a little time for he pulled the plug but you do that\n[laughter]\nGot until the end of the week but that's it\nProbably wasted too much in my time on this project will read I'll call you on friday\nOh I just don't understand it\nJust we but clearly talking about a Hollywood based show well Harry I'd say someone didn't get the message really be always serious about pulling the trigger he practically offered me a cigarette and a blindfold [noise]\nJesus Christ got any ideas and really\nThe way I figure there's only three kinds of shows there's live shows from the east coast which Lucy won't do and live shows from the west coast which bill won't buy that just leaves filmed the shows but\nThis is a situation comedy no one's ever done one of those on films that I don't see how we'd ever convince bill that would work for I Love Lucy hold on a second we've got we've got one what a film situation comedy Amos and Andy it premieres next month no kidding how does it look it looks terrific box\nIt's filmed on a sound stage with no audience and you know how important the audience is loose leaf in Harry let's just take one step at a time we can figure out the audience thing later but we need to get deal back on board right now uh come Monday you'll be looking at a big hole in your fall schedule and Lucy and dizzy and I will be looking for work\nHow quickly can you screen Amos and Andy for beer or Mexico right now cook all phone Desi and fill them in ... and Harry ... when you talk to business affairs get them to finish the Philip Morris contract already after today I'm not going to get a wink asleep and the bad thing is signed a makes two of us\nThe Amos and Andy screening CBS Rachel produced a show on film so for them or a set of stay in Hollywood but\nThere were still want snag feel what's going to an extra five thousand a week and be all wouldn't pay a penny of it that left our agents darn sharp to battle it out with CBS [noise]\nUp on our getting thankful [noise]\nWell boys and girls I say I earned my ten percent this week what he's talking about Don with a lot of doing but I got CBS to pony up most of the extra money it'll cost to do the show on Tim\nHow much eighty percent can you believe it I got him to boost the budget by four grand you just have to cut you combined salary by a thousand dollars a week to make up the different pretty sensational huh that's fine don't fine that's all you think it is fine\nNo no I think is great really great Don there's just one thing or is that you don't see and I want to own one hundred percent of the show\nYou do we do\nI've been sitting here thinking over this whole thing a weekly show means no more doors for me a little more pictures little see if we are going on here we are so make this television show we should at least on what we make\nBut she'll be taking on a hundred percent of the production cost overruns I Know and I wait a second and what that does owning the show with CBS still takes the same cut from the sponsor pays each week I ever going to make a profit and you'll be lucky if there's anything left over to pay your own salary\n[noise]\nNow LA theater which continues with I Love Lucy a\nFunny thing happened on the weight of the sitcom like Greg Oppenheimer Stein Oscar Munoz and Sarah Drew\nAre you doing all be doing just fine once you told me on the higher where you didn't have the best politician well then what ball or\nYour reputation and they were says going up a holiday\nOh sons of branches are always saying that those bastards\nListen or knows I'm telling you that I don't have a drinking problem [noise]\nCan I got another drink over here\n... let me explain something I don't know how much you were drinking thought\nI'll drink on any back a year or two ago and I don't get what CBS says you know why why because they say the same thing about me no good yeah but Lucy and I have a lot riding on this project and we've got enough problems without ... Singh is so what is what I'm saying you got that far\nAlong condition and what would that be\nYou're a big baseball fan right only the biggest\nBorders I got to do with the prices leg I\nHere's the deal I hire you for the show [noise] boy you only get three strikes you mind telling me what you're talking about the first time you've gone through your job\nFor any reason will walk along you\nSecond time same thing work around you but the third time\nThat strike three and you're out out of what I thought my job\nJust what does this job pagan three hundred and fifty dollars a week well it's one hell of a lot less in my last picture\nBut then this is a study paycheck is not it is as long as we're on the air I mean ... ... Cuban you got yourself a bill for their foreigner uh-huh\nIt won't be sorry now uh I just need you to do me one favor\nJust hired you over CBS is objectionable okay one more favor I might need a couple of days off the first week in October to keep a personal commitment personal maim us right I'm not sure yet whether all need to take time off it all depends on what\nOn whether the Yankees win the pennant if they do I promised myself I wouldn't miss the series opener\nBy\n\nWilliam probably it was perfect for Fred both finding the right doctors to lay ESL hotter stumped now days until we met with a new director mark Daniels\nIs anyone asked William of Raleigh maybe he has an idea of should play his wife on the show all he has an idea All right mark but as it turns out Ava Gardner isn't available\nYou know who would be perfect Vivian van V. didn't who Vivian\nOn television you know it was a community theater in Marblehead, Massachusetts are you a great feat Lucy and our ... our thoughts on this show\nI knew a spectacle you so much from community theater Vivian know amateur oh she's been in half a dozen Broadway show that she made any picture sure she just finished the blue veil opposite Charles ... so what you're doing now as a matter of fact\nShe's in a play with ... to play house we should go down and see what's the what's the comedy called the voice of the turtle\nI'm telling you to the video is perfect for the part about well unless ... performance I'll call and get tickets ... will be going with us loose who's not going anywhere right now she just had a baby remember oh right\nAnd then I'll get a free tickets for the Martin I\nBelieve me you won't be sorry [noise]\nYes\nThink we found All right so what did I tell you he's got my vote that's all for her the part right now but don't we need the networks okay\nNow ...

their stride\nAm I don't remember now ...\nYou know I've been in this business for a long time and if I've learned anything that you need to base this kind of a decision on the complete set of fact we don't even have the ratings yet my strong recommendation is the way the least a week before you do anything\nAbout and that is correct or I don't want to but that's all\nAs it turned out that with ratings for those in the top ten and the very next morning bargain McComas center ... saying how much he loved our first episode\nBy April we made it all the way to a number one but our audience kept

I Want from you if you agree with them is that you informed them that we will not accept them telling us what not to do unless in the future they also tell us what to do\nA ... point we will cease to

about that anyway how come we're\nGoing to shoot to endings one for the boy one for a girl and then put the right one at the last minute right yeah so and so we break our backs and spend a small fortunate do it for what the TV baby and your real baby won't have the same name but why do they have to be the same sex\nWhy not just decide on a boy or girl and be done with it makes sense to me and if it were my decision I give the record as a boy is more comedy\nPotential I agree about the comedy potential no less yield department and then what Lucy gave me one girl she might give me another
