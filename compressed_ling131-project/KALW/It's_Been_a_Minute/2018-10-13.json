[noise]\n[noise] ooh [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse Thorn in a resume that has spent decades Sarah Jessica Parker has performed some of the most compelling characters in TV and film\nShe kicked off her career adjust Fifteen starring on the CBS teenage comedy square pegs from there she appeared in movies like footloose LA Story and hocus pocus and there's also some show called sex in the city no big deal\nWhen I talked with her a couple of years ago she just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorce its second season wrapped up earlier this year\nThey're working on a third one now it's a drama there that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and reverse that you find in its wake Sarah place Francis a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker\nDon't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there is something compelling\nAbout the way they interact on screen\nThe series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very Frank and sometimes very funny way\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce in this scene from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband the news [noise] you\nSpent last Christmas\nFishing in Alaska\nNow hang on a second that's the only time of the year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind didn't mind\nIt was the best Christmas our problem in years You're welcome\nSometimes I come home from work I'm [noise]\nActually feel horrible\nAnd then I think you're highly are part of your home [noise]\nThis is about my own job\nIs and what this is I Want to save my life while I still care about it\nAlthough I Love you anymore\n\nOn divorce\nSarah Jessica Parker welcome to both say thank you thank you so much for having me I Want to ask you something I'm a serious to begin with which is I had this experience or a couple of years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife\nA split up they were married and um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought oh that was for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\nMhm [laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people live three thousand miles from me [laughter] that guy I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd a eight or it occurred to me like how intense I just I guess I just never ... I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience ... and the wall just crumbled but all in one go [laughter] mhm\nUm and I wonder what it's like for you to live with and the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show live with divorce you know every day when you\nThe experience is I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather I guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends marriage fall apart you know for me\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially and developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party I have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorced and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubs and relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the tone that I was hoping for\nBecause it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um make alliances um and I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorce when it's not their own are really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the ... like ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel for God and I don't mean like in the sense like or does it make you feel like a you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm but like it's it's like an extra central dread for\n[laughter] [noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad\nUm and I'm I'm I I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by\nIt because it's both an artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children in a ... active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like pushing on the bruised I I've always been that way and\nUm I I'm\nMuch more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the bruise scene from divorce\nSo ah your character's name is Francis is a head hunter and this is that this is the cold open to the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new good um and they have this conversation\nFor members would be the kind of growth is\nGrown and it was okay uh what are you looking for I'm not sure\nThis job for twenty plus years says the same thing over and over and over and over here are getting any younger goalie bruises on a new challenge\nIs all big world out there [noise] last one into\nLearn more at NPR wine club dot org ... this is NPR\nIt's ...

I thought he was I mean there was a reason I kept paying to see him um yeah so when we started dating um we met\nThrough um friends in the theater he was on the brothers and Matthew and\nMatthew best friend founded the theater company called make it angels and I'd be hanging around there and um that's how we met and ah for sure part of that was I'd seen that in on a big screen and liked what I saw\nUm\nOr how do you feel about Thomas feeding churches distinctive mustache and the show divorce\n[noise] um I like it very much I'm I'm I'm so glad that he did that because it really has become a the six\nCharacter on the show [laughter] um [laughter] and um it's been a wonderful conversation ... [laughter] I ...\nI since I don't know a whole conversation we are cheering hoard and on the show really wondering a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about Iraq stage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like a ... with the moustache me too I mean it's so great and so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly wide dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous\nWilliam and Mary perfect way it is that really helps define that character who has lost qualities\nAt top totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show\nAnd in fact earlier than that I started thinking about what I Hope that this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I Want it the music to look like and the costumes and seventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration for me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies and the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it fits so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter] I Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or\nWho is interested in music would have a reaction not just to the obviously to the source music but to the compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was it so beautifully fit into these ideas\nThey're just good worker or a um\nUh you came in to talk to us uh I I really appreciate you taking the time oh it's such a treat and\nYou just did not let me down at all and you\nAsk such good smart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to half time with you said thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently washing the first two seasons of divorce on HBO Now an HBO Go she's also starring in in producing a new movie called here and now that set to hit theaters November ninth [noise]\nGets bull's eye I'm Jesse for my next guest is Chris gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris gathered show\nIt aired first on New York city public access television then later on the network fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or in don't think twice the micro ... improv movie\nCritics also stand up and when we talk you've done a really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it with Judd Apatow\nGenuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression and even death but he does it in ways that are totally human very identifiable very funny of course has a new book coming out it's called lose well and it's sort of a self help book\nHe talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business stories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band\nThe lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail and if you want to know the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show here she's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials [noise]\nI get stuck in acting work I'm getting most of the commercials mostly commercials if you start to ... to\nTo this day you go deep enough in the search results you can still find him very annoying\nCommercial for H R Block where I where later holiday [noise]\nI once audition for a subway sandwich commercial to play the role all man who is on attractive to women\n[noise]\nI couldn't even call them or something like [noise]\nI didn't book that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered welcome back to bull's eye it's good to see a great to see you too so your new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking about\nYou know what [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I could talk about I can stop [laughter] everything I have to say about it in in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platforms from the ... 'cause that's really what I have to say about it um 'cause it had been many years of talking about it in some form or another and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought for sure\nHe feels like part of what you're doing in the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you were on the show I think is in writing about it I mean performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nI think that's a very astute observation\nKnows that if it's not hidden it has less power over me if it's not something I'm trying to\nYou know overcome quietly in private than other people might actually help\nAnd there's something he said to for\nYou know anytime I anytime I put it out there and ... and other people respond to it like it sometimes people you know people have seen the show and they'll wait afterwards and say oh like I really identify with that thank you for saying that it rang true\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse for my guest Chris ... is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which book stores October sixteenth we talked last year\nWhat are the things you talk about in your special show\nFor suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be emotionally healthy because of that yeah um two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that\nThe second part is do you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not\nCapital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like if you got cast on as the second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom was an evil but neither was it a place for teenagers to come out right\nRight it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a chip on his shoulder that might work clearly has now [laughter] at it like I'm definitely work a ...\nThere's still wrap my head around his then I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go it tomorrow which could getting better about that you know I have a little bit more stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can just get one of those big jobs everybody after noticed it and\nIt's I have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of a cop to the fact of like\nThat is there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that asks cat in New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and that's been out talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get what's my next gig ... but I might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're on the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say\nSome of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show rate shows more funding if in that show than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some of it yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride when my favorite shows of all\nTime course but it doesn't have that fire and it to cut trying to prove something [laughter]\nYou know they have their mission statement of trying to like break the system and sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know anybody outing ... or by indie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows\nMy work would say that guy spent years bending over backwards to try to do this thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I could move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel out of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to see because I I feel like one of the things that I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago nobody\nWas particularly interested in the hat to just like kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them not to have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen\nSo that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs\nThat could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world but who knows\n[noise] it's bull's eye I'm Jesse for I'm Talking with the comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now\nFriend of mine was telling me this past week has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of warnings are my friends told his company for sixty five million dollars not only does is make bad art and I was like a dream make bad art yeah\nI mean that's already make it better I Would have been doing for years [laughter] yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars sure [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad ours that's perfect\nYeah it is funny they're talking about the idea of moving on it you know they get their show when I talk about the gathered show for years that has been my people and they're still my people\nTheir punk kids they're weirdos they're artists\nA lot of them are clear a lot of them are doing things their own way you know a lot of them either by choice or by necessity or people who have walked their own path and they find this and it's like oh this is a community of people over there I'll bet it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny\nThey are so why is that like\nI get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people this past week I was in a fight with my own thing club\nI might they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my thing club the get the ads and I was obviously mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship and I get the sense\nSometimes that like they are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nDebt me being in ... movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous ... a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream press buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show where I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can steal them being happy for it but I can also feel to feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that because I feel like that's what I've always been working towards is trying to get a better head on my shoulders so weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that the more the bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah sleepover your credit pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claimed to be this rebel tried to ah throw rocks from the outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that\nBut I don't really know what else I Am\nAre you worried that you're not going to get get that from that show and you're gonna have to move to a CBS andme enlarge the band\nOh my God that we are bigger theatre [laughter] follow that man's life I Would be very\nOften I don't know I just read a biography of Batman his lifetime horrible yeah in\n... I can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture yeah they're ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant out of this box genius um [laughter] ... has been thrilled about no far as the things he read about the actual um loneliness actually doesn't seem great\nBut I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major concern of mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk\nThat is behind it is not talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone instills weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there used to be this element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable\nAnd now in my opinion seems much more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nLetterman you sometimes just like get a permit to shut down the block so he could pour ten thousand rubber balls off the roof of his duty onto the street and that was it no thought about it beyond that\nLet's just send the guy into the deli across the street with a camera so I can talk to the deli guy\nKnow planning beyond that you were not scripted rubber the deli man as to say certainly you know let's bring Harvey ... getting an actual fight attempts Jerry ... slap Andy Kaufman across the face these unplanned chaotic moments I'm that Letterman in particular I think now", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "13"}
