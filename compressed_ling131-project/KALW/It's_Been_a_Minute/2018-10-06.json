chemistry there that just the idea in my mind ... going on stage\nBecause it was inevitable that we were going to go on stage at some point soon and reform our act whatever it was going to be and I had a feeling in my bones that the two of us together just the image of his face\nAnd my face up on stage together that there was something undeniably hilarious about it while I'm being funny and wrong and wonderful man I did not see that he didn't see that I felt it in my bone [laughter] well\nWe didn't even perform proper like in a club\nOr like four years armed with the actors gang a at a coffee house on high on no longer there highland ground ground so and we named our so on on our first concert there it wasn't a concert it was like we were part of a variety show yeah and we got like our five minutes slot machine that show and we named ourselves and\nPart of our slot was naming the band and we gave the audience a multiple choice\nAnd a one of them was gorgeous sons miss

biblical theater and tenacious D. and in the audience who is in the\nAudience that day prophetic\nThank you Harry Shearer of spinal tap was ... and he voted voted for pets or meat 'cause I I think he's just pals with Michael Moore [laughter] but the\nFact that he was there\nWas a sign from the from the metal God's that we were on the right track and we were anointed\nSerious [noise]\nOh You're

legend over dinner so when we asked him to talk about the song that changed his life you'd think he might go with a bellwether song right but instead he picked love unhappiness\nA classic from another all time great soul singer algorithm okay let's go to say my introduction to Al Green I'm anybody major probably laugh at this was actually watching pulp fiction [noise]\nEverybody knows the scenes you\nBoost and you know they're playing this this cool Seventy soul music\nPainful as it may be\nIn your days of just about [noise]\nWithout the fact of life you asked is going to have to get through a list of ...\nAny acquaintance is such a genius for using music and he's in it crazy ways you know and it ...\nMe this whole tradition of how soul\nMusic is use or in these gangster movie and the black gangster movies and it was so cool you know and and immediately made me want to\nLearn who was that singer what was the sound what was this behind the scenes\nThe business is filled to the brim with an unrealistic [noise]\nWho thought they asked what age like one [noise]\nHave you made in terms of vinegar\nHave you mean it gets better when they\nDon't\nHave to go by the soundtrack to pop fiction and I went to the electric fetus which was princes favorite record store in Minneapolis that's where I pretty much you know build my entire collection from jazz they have\nIt was and remains to this day and just been amazing record shop\nAnd a man that's what the CD home open it up and that's how I was led stay together by Al Green and said okay who's Al Green [noise] you know and then\nAnd then this one track eleven happiness just completely you know grab me and it took me you know another direction no\n\nNo we're coming from a jazz background I'm I'm always looking for

comes in you know on a box\n[laughter]\nThat they didn't they didn't do it and it was like oh okay I was a student of jazz standard which are\nVery clever and you know [noise] a verb ghosts and [noise] you know this was a quite different you know he's standing at the same loving happiness okay\nAnd you're like wait a minute something's going wrong oh\nCome and go do some one of those rooms\nWith the drama you know some was on the phone three o'clock in the morning and like that kind of rhyme coming from hip hop I loved that immediately you know you can do something going wrong three o'clock in the ... own somebody on the phone\nYou know talking about she can make it was like that's such an intriguing line that I was already hooked because I'm a I'm a lyricist and aware it's meant to\nBe with me [noise] [noise] [noise] you know\nAt that point I was really a jazz jazz by ... you know that much about so and I didn't understand it our brain\nAnd Marvin Gaye withers Lou well all these guys started Jesse they had a certain kind of jazz information and your hair out in the very beginning go up and hold that no no\nJust hold it forever that could be like Sarah Vaughan you know that kind of like into it was really cool\nTo me [noise] [noise]\nYeah [noise] the gym in ... when\nWhen you do\nBut he cut his record for high record in Memphis and they were known for a very distinctive [noise] one of the distinctive things about these sessions that Iraq has red hot his brothers teeny Hodges on guitar Charles on Oregon Levi on base and\nWe had the legendary al Jackson on most syndrome sessions and that\nWith a section was so legendary they were responsible for you know cranking out so many of that era what strikes me about how they recorded this track to our brains focal it's very raw may come home [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] you\nKnow you know I was used to the Michael Jackson which is very hot you know there's like there's like three lead vocals and it's very smooth and there's like ... and all these things this is just one might you can tell you know he's in a room with them you know what I mean\nI Love it because it really conveys all of the emotion in his delivery captures every meal on this is almost like documentary recording like it's obviously was a huge hit but it's like this is a moment of him just jamming with these guys and performing and he's really performing in thirty to fill that energy\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis track open my eyes to a third path and if you know I knew about jazz which to me he was about learning to standards they provide them off of the changes and I knew about kind of more power you know\nI wasn't a rapper you know I didn't have the skills to be a nasty\nAnd this is like a third pack is like you could be a singer songwriter like our dream but it's still full of jazz information instilled parking and direct marriages and I don't know just a light bulb went off and it made sense\nThat [noise]\n[noise] say Jay with the song that changed his life\nHis new album is lean on me it's a great collection of bill weather's coverage and it's out now I really think James is one of the great singers going right now let's take a listen to one more song off of his new record this one is lovely day\n[noise] some men
