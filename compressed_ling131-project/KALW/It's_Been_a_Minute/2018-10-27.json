I'm Jesse four and my guest Eric Idle is a founding member of Monty Python you start in movies like the holy grail and the life of Brian in so many more he's got a new book out it's called always look on the bright side of life ...\nA memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing ... was added difficult part of writing the book\nIt was it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does it go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I particularly Robin I haven't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owe it to him to write about him because I known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was the that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into its ... knees what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know they make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is whether folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise] um\nYeah how do how do you feel differently about they're passing as a you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and renting right we're going to dinner or I've gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's you suddenly there's oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that does apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and just you know ... to write about people I Want you to write about titles lights um\nWhat's that looking straight she broke eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I liked the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIf the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nI mainly one's a server read the books and [laughter] they're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of his left of able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly\nNot us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\nYou know ... fifty it's it's not our anniversary [laughter] ... somebody answers wedding anniversary [laughter] it's a very strange one but I thought I Would write my book because I knew I'd be ... questions\nAnd forgotten [laughter] do you think of it all differently now than you did Twenty years ago or even like I'm Talking about after the movies were made and so on and so forth but still a long time ago\nA very long time ago and it it just it's amazing to me because it just seems to get big I mean it doesn't seem to ... becomes more ... in the end you just you know well what can you do\nYou embrace it enjoy it and be grateful for all those wonderful people that you met along the way and all the many laugh we were doing comedy so we have a lot of blood is often that's really right\nEric I'm so grateful that you came here to be on

that's excellent and I guess in terms of just like places that are on the outskirts of major cities\nAnd write what that kind of breeds in culture and uh yeah when people I mean it's it's it's kind of a weird place I mean I mean you know actually that mess of all is not even a masterful because\nThings and feeding as I tend to make actually these like playlists and mix tapes for myself of other people's music that\nFeed into it but then within that I've I find I see the things I'm missing or the things I Want to\nFill in and meld together so that's kind of Forman but it like the music doesn't exist you know like it's in my head this kind of thing and then I'm Bryson words down so I started rising level of ... and then I kind of like\nKind of work it out like I have an idea of why I think a track list and would be so I knew I wanted to open a record and use a change I wanted to go for in the middle and I kind of knew how and it's and it and then I kind of like fit it in and I make that mood\nYou know [laughter] it's kind of a weird way and so old attracts tend to actually finish\nAt the same time in the mix and versus region when I'm ... makes in Iraq and we'll just before that the ... start to finish because it's hard for me to finish track to if I Know I haven't finished checked three\nSo it's really rare that like I could play a track to someone but I'll ...\nIt it
