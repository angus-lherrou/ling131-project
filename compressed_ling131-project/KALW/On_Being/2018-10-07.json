I'm always kind of pursuing [noise] and then what each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nUm I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there's some things you said about riding high science intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them as hell writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps this story from writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it sure fight it writing has shown me what happens with patients and someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to him and to the likes of using\nI think they're writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought of why wouldn't it be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter]\nBut I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing is to study writing and\nIt was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years\nI wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward mhm that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took\nMe I Want to say\nMaybe a year and a half to two years to write but it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethic piece it's like six pages long yeah\nYeah yeah what did you just briefly say what what's happening and that he's\nIn thirty eight yeah\nBriefly in thirty eight it's a\nWritten two and four then duck ... thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight duck puts him in who were harmed\nAnd um as a result of this sue appraising which came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was was getting smaller and smaller and um\nAnd finally down to something like a ten mile tracked and people ... people did not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a store credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising and\nAs a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um\nBasically they lost their land\nAnd if it was really large this is a legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is raised tree we don't know ... or we don't teach 'em yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this topic along this emerged to patients writing all of this\nNo absolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with a piece mhm and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination\nIs something that I have to really respect like its\nOwn little person yeah [laughter] and so I Can't do man too much of it sometimes I have to\nLet it take a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through writing Mm yeah\nI was looking at page sixty four ... whereas I did not desire and childhood and also page sixty five which was another you know part of the way you also reflected on what an apology is", "year": "2018",
