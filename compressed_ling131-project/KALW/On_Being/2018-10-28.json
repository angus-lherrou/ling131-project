BBC News\nIn Nineteen Seventy two married by Bush writes I was at thirty year old American traveling in India with the smell of incense in my hair and monstrous repeating in my ears back then if you

Magazine\nMore recently she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself\nNearby Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers\nHer odyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just a story of tools that help us to be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many tradition and secular stick of modern life\nIn the beginning you couldn't ever say what the environmental leaders are called the L Word and [laughter] what I meant the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart opens that brings really change\nI had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even and just very secular working situations recently is and I used to be because people really\nWant to look for [laughter] ... [laughter]\nAnd I'm always just aren't sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative\nMind in society and she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke in two thousand Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life well\nWas brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood and um\nI think you know the Catholic children are part of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the St right so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous storage of saints [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nThat an interesting idea that Joan of and so I'm just really know how it is Joan of arc and by the aspirations of a girl in Madison New Jersey\n[laughter] well ruined her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I I I liked that but she did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nThe basics of art that she started hearing God talking to her and telling her what to do and I was a little girl and ... you know recognizing how confusing life is\nRight [laughter] [laughter] so but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way\nBring this into um our lives on the west so first I ...\nBush and I was ... and and yeah yeah but what I was most interested in at a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who worked there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated in ways into the business that would\nEmbodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice so you know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and try to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood yeah where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the feces and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that have recognized about what makes a person\nMore creative more able to ah bring their their whole settled into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nRight say [noise] that is the shaft that is still a\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicalities\nThis story of searching such ourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find\nThat language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't\nTake yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said\nWhen I was younger he been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him\nSo he'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are all costs\nI joined the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasized the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course a big came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy or with us back all those great guy I'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about ... just so important in the workplace and\nOn the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted the course and in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right there but this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really\nSo intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has this faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's something that is a tradition that has focused on that for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was asked but that is the intention right have yeah that is in and that is just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you know Richard Davidson Danny O'Connor\nFascinating is that he was Quaker and then there was something in your work ... through\nAnd seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human and tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center oh and cs Lewis send the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really crazy him\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we are we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who\nWere beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for what practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise]\nAnd um we gathered these other little hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean\nAll the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating we are opening our\nHearts recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which there's much that we all share even with all of our differences and waking up to that can happen through these practices so we created on called the tree of contemplative practice is on the website\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and brought lying down [laughter] for far right they brought their phones in front of them [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the second one just right [laughter] right\n[noise] well okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google\nFor loved that she put it in her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop\nTakes a deep breath follow your brass\nIn and out in and out ... and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send and the first time we we did it\nThere was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and said how did it go\nAnd um they all said that was radical knows me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nAll right so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful ...\nI wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activist some really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is the understanding that it's not\nActing out or on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body\nHolds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see interesting ways to resolve it\nAnd to be able to act on it I communicated\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd that last hundred is there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that are so interesting every special retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nIt's I mean we we laugh but it has you know it's a date with lawyers worry that\nCan they be zealous advocate for their client at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right and they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them when it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it has about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experience as a press about why that is true yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer\nRight which is ... have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can just sit and be be uh [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social handling and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with\nMindfulness and contemplative practice [noise] it's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have um\nI've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us\nAll that but it's very hard\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's a it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there\nIs this something where you really do have to find a way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices ... David teaching Christian practices um someone doing should be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness of the breads and walking meditation right and mine for listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the began to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that once people begin to experience that that they will\nFind what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that there's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory\nPractice but when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say what the ah environmental leaders called the L Word and they didn't mean lesbian meant [laughter] what what I meant the L Word was love\nAnd there are practices and most used is the love and\nKindness practicing rank Sharon ... has really written a lot about and the compassion practices are related to that in which you're more about appreciation for others and a desire to relieve the suffering of others", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "28"}
