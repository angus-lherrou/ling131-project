I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for a coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our

[laughter] wherever hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal last year you write a letter to\nLouisiana friends on argued say ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal\nFriend I mean I there was a sentence and in your letter to your friends on the liberal left\n... even human way consider the possibility that end their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um it's so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [noise]\nUm okay what if that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise]\nI think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left a at the blue collar class that lived there serious look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair our telephone ... or re paving roads where [noise]\nWho are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of old cocoon I've long been here\nAs I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it\nUm and that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it's as if\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger him and [noise]\nThere there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors and and classes got together natural way it can be theory on each other then yeah yeah yeah\nPublic school system is um but we're down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf the one where a very yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach ... get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does that connective tissue yeah [laughter]\nOur station myself that um [noise] there's critique that you know [laughter] they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of\nColor um who have long felt like\nStrangers in their own land in this country and then this late right and yeah yes and especially now yet again and\nIt's when white people that you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people um\nHow do you have you work with that in your mind [noise]\nLet's see it's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise]\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair which is kind of a compassionate way\nCrack epidemic\nWith no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was a criminal and timely yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise] so and so it's a point is that should be broadly received\nMhm [noise] so and when to draw too close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and Dennis is and I ... I ended up having that interest welcome and [noise]\nAnd he said some of its own kind mutual is created I just found that intriguing 'cause I think so much about the power of words and I wonder if you had 'em or their words you're using now he's thinking are there and and branch that gets out of symbols and how important that is frustration in constructing our world [noise]\nWell I use the word empathy and uh it's uh something we're all capable of\nAnd uh we in a way to carry around a little empathy map who we should and shouldn't feel and ... of and we need to enlarge those maps right and a shift them and so maybe there are different kinds of empathy that so [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
