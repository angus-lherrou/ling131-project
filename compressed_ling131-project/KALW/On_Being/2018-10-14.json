University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big following on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the gym onto the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation to two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThere were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Christian ticket and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I Move through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nDeep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work\nAbout repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we can no longer nuts\nThat was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you uh\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think so [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you\nYou grew up as a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is more than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party and Brooklyn in the summer to sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nAnd you complained uncivil e [laughter]\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pulls talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy mark\nThese trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they\nAnd um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which I was like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and ready forgotten it's ...\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and then\nThey they have the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of\nIt has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\n... and so I mean there are studies that when people have\nTo ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this dehumanization of technology that then allows us to fuel\nThe dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of\nNurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually unemployed I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric as I come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh is\nNicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and Jack [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to\nYeah do books um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nHabit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there are so bassist and they're so Islamophobia and I hate them [laughter]\n'cause they're so hateful I hate it out I Know\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's an inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntentions to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people I still don't assume you mean\nMe uh well I don't\nCan and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people\nOh there is if I Want them to believe the best of me you you actually called that a daily spiritual practice that says\nYou know I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them they're related dynamics of this which is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted likes them so they didn't have been a very particular instance are you said something\nI mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes\nAnd um and the word goat was an inch of yes yeah and I've talked to my natural about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\n... you know it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in when I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see this above right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way ... and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when is just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\n[noise] um you know look I think it's very\n... to point just it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\nProvincial as them that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped\nLed to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way the skull first\nLike look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes um that people can change and go and in fact that is a core of progressive politics\nIs that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the\nSegregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality\nWe are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that didn't make it invites change in the country and individuals\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing\nAnd growing then\nYou have to be able to literally practice what you preach and creates space for people to change and why ...\n... when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've gotta we've got to improve we get a preview others are we going to reverse I\nAnd I get a lot these days we'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this is absolutely use those ... lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox um\nYou know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah hate is not the answer\nTo hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of ... yeah I don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love\nThat definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are a ... a a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican for so [laughter]\nBut if there are studies that\nYou know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools\n... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after\nSchool programs are are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called con life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at\nThis you know Sally said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men and\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have\nOf what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\n[noise] I um\nHave\nThe experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself\nHim up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it\nIt in them as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like [laughter]\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or\nKids who were just saying nasty violent racist\nThings and who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity and transformed those dynamics\nOn Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of\nThe power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to add to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high\nRoad I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful an equal\nAnd so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nYou know I'm always struck um ... ... if it just riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the circuit in the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships in communities on line\nAnd we're still alone and then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nWith the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer\nAnd I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee that we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian ... Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and they're\nWe're an unlocked door in a war meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are ... are blessed to be sure with others\nFree\nJesus um\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to fit and this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we\nCould finish one minute early which would please something deep and my radio bonds but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better I\nI don't know if this is a kind of just want to bring\nUp with the two of you and in this room that very much on my mind is that is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so\nFixated road from William for really because there's more\nTo life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some things that puzzles me am curious about the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know\nFor a long time it's been true that on abortion\nYou know something like sixty to sixty five percent of Americans across party lines saver you know abortion with limit now there's a big conversation about what those limits are but rather than always having a same fight about it's always right or it's always wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "14"}
