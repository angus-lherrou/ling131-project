securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets about taking the company private he'll stay on as CEO and I know it's tough\nTo separate the conversation about Tesla from the conversation about you know I must but let's talk about cars for a minute because it feels like electric car announcements are coming fast and furious lately Mercedes Audi Ford is promising an electric crossover that's the size of a Tesla model acts but inspired by that must staying\nThere are rumors of a thirty thousand dollar electric Volkswagen so is Tesla's biggest problem actually competition\nMarianne Keller is an independent auto industry analyst and she says sort of\nThe difference between what Tesla has done and these newcomers and there are some very competent vehicles coming from Mercedes and Audi BMW Porsche jaguar is that these were not purpose built electric vehicles day we're existing vehicles that had been modified\nFor battery power this isn't the states they're not good very good and I think the fact that they're being built by companies with the reputation for excellence as all of these are I think that whatever supply they have they will probably sell\nIs it also still a luxury market I mean having to model three woes and kind of a new electric car announcements we've seen made it seem like the market isn't\nHave the charging infrastructure in this country to enable widespread usage of electric vehicles\nThey are still very very expensive and it's not for different kinds of inducement used by the federal government and various state governments to encourage the purchase of these vehicles we probably wouldn't see the demand that we do now\nNow that we're starting to see more of a move I guess toward electric vehicle is there a possibility that people would look at Tesla and Eli mosque and say you know what\nMaybe we don't actually want anything to do with this market maybe it was all based on the cult of personality and not real well I think the\nEuropeans which is where you have most of the activity these days are in a different situation because of the diesel scandal in Europe they have had to move very quickly toward alternative technology for clean energy and the only option in the short run is batteries\nYou can hardly keep up with the number of announcements that the German car companies are making you know the rapid transformation of their product lines which they're all that jazz thing will be completed by mid next decade they're not saying that\nAll of their vehicles within five or six years are going to be full electric they're going to have product that would be acceptable in all parts of the world and the U.S is not expected to move as quickly toward full electrics as Europe or China China's going to be first to go to full electric\nMarianne Keller is an independent auto industry analyst the Paris auto show what's happening this week look for plenty more ie the announcements from the big name she mentioned\nAnd also Tesla which is still planning to bring the model for you and show it off the French customers who have made model three reservation\nHello I'm girl off good evening I'm Jeff Douglas this is as it happens\nHard\nBargain a last minute trade deal between Canada the U.S and Mexico has been pronounced historic and a victory but his new name is tougher differ now when\nSome you'll lose them and how

scrambled to pronounce ... scramble as it happens Monday edition radio that believes he is correct\nAbout God oh my God [laughter]\n\nA victory for all Canadians are not as how Canada's foreign affairs minister Christie a free one has described the U.S MCA the trade deal to replace NAFTA the U.S Mexico Canada agreement comes after months of tough negotiating\nWashington DC to Ottawa here is what prime minister Justin Trudeau said today\nI think we have all been through moments or over the course of these negotiations where we felt very close only to see it or not end up working out so I think we were all very mindful that there was a definite window that now\nWhere the uh the midnight deadline by the United states to send a text or Congress a was a very real deadline that gave us an opportunity to work towards that\nBut I have to say from my own perspective it was there wasn't a single a ha moment there was just a series of okay we got this one settled wow we ... we still going to talk about this one and it's not done yet but there was this sense that when things were falling into place I think one of the moments for me was when we realized that we had\nA an entire chapter Nineteen uh that was where I started to realize okay you know what I think I think we're going to be able to get to a to a place 'cause we've kept in place are the rules\nProtect trait and enforce trade agreements like this\nFor his part US President Donald Trump also declared victory today at a press conference in Washington DC a reporter asked him about tensions between him and prime minister Trudeau here's how we responded\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that\nIt was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada\nAnd now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to brand new deal not NAFTA redone it's brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner don't forget the rest of the world\nIs looking to take advantage of us and has a region you might say and\nWe're going to work very closely together with Canada and Mexico\nBecause we'll be able to compete with anybody we have we have things that nobody else as we have energy that nobody else has we have Kimber that nobody else as we have things that no other part of the world has to the extent that we have so we're going to do very well together I think we have there was a lot of tension I Will say a between\nHe and I think more specifically and\nIn which all worked out and you know when it ended about twelve o'clock last night and you mentioned the but he's a good man he's done a good job and he he loves that people have Canada\nAnd back in ... ad question period that the talk predictably was all about trade here's some spring between foreign affairs minister Christian frequent and conservative MP ...\nThree here [noise]\nThat doesn't seem like a I guess it's an awful trade to a lot of Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because um that the NAFTA deal is already in place chaplain Nineteen was already in place\nSo if chapter Nineteen or this or NAFTA panel such an efficient it's such a great uh I think to have a why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't it going to be able to protect us from terrorists in our automobile\nUh if if that's not the panel was half worth ... uh for giving up the air in history or we shouldn't have been concerned about those terrorists than the first place\nWhat would you have done would you have walked away would you said no deal\nOr it's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to hit us with more tariffs so that that was not a good situation for candidate is falling and but um I I didn't find this was like any other trade negotiation at least with uh the European\nAnd the Trans Pacific deal ah everyone was there I think it grossed shooting fairly\nThis one was more like extortion this one was that they hijacked sectors of our economy they threatened to do irreparable damage to our economy\nAnd if we didn't give them what they wanted a they would proceed with these tariffs um I I found it was very aggressive there wasn't that go sheeting or this wasn't a negotiation this was a negotiating our way out of a hostage situation\nSo again would you walked away then would you have said no deal I'm not going to be held hostage\nSome somebody has to do this a weight Trump is proceeding in and and uh\nThe way he's he ruined I I find so many uh of parts of a society uh I thought Canada was going to the country\nTo to stand up to them and said you know this isn't right we have rules in place NAFTA already had certain rules that you shouldn't have been able to to put tariffs on aluminum and steel and they told me to address those issues we shouldn't have been any further\nWhat we heard today from prime minister to do and some foreign affairs minister freelance\nWas that and they basically said that well that the upside for the dairy farms dairy farmers is that the supply management system is fundamentals in at least are still in place and that the dairy farmers are going to be compensated for losses they suffer as part of this trade deals so against Mitt Canadian point of view\nIt's hard to see how we've lost that what would you say back if you could be at that press conference and respond what would you say\nHow did we get to that point that we were no longer\nOut of it so that we didn't get including the stories I I don't understand why we allow ourselves to be on her knees as bad as we want we were in a bad position and uh they negotiated to salvage something but\nWe weren't smart enough to get ourselves in a better position for them so lucky\nAnd now if it does go to as we see it how does that change your life how does that change your work your business\nOr you mentioned the compensation package Jeff uh they've had numerous compensation packages of credit for for other Jake deals that I received your dollars to date usually instead of giving a money over to your farmers to figure out the best way to distribute it\nThey come up with some was our way of uh investing it in our farms and uh if you don't fit the exact the type that they want for the investment then you're not eligible on the money is always an issue so to date I've received dollars\nBut are you going to survive are you going is your business going to do the okay\nThis doesn't help I mean the ... of course you know you ... your carry on I'm a I'm Still relatively young I have a son was wanting to come home and farm\nSo uh we'll have to make an investment and trying to\nBe more efficient or fight back the market share that we've lost a lot of money or reinvest that money and and and try and get my cash flow back up to where it was for\nA while I survival of the rate at which are going a trading off a three plus percent uh every year we only know how much of our market share\nA no it can't continue to go on forever doing that and the problem is is next time you go to negotiate no one's ever happy with what they have they'll want more so if we're already over ten percent of a given up of our market the Americans only allowed to ... percent of the trade war over ten percent now\nSo who's who's the protection of food who's not a free trader and I will not says\nOkay not so good points to a mysterious can I appreciate speaking with you thank you well thank you for calling\nJason ... is a dairy farmer we reached him an inch in brook Quebec and we will have more on the U.S ... later on in the program including various tongue twisting attempts to pronounce the name of the new agreement and an interview with former conservative cabinet minister Peter McCain\n[noise]\n\nFirst there was an earthquake and then came the water and deadly six meter soon on me\n\n[noise]\nThat is a clip from a video that has been circulating on social media a man on a balcony warning people below the water is coming\nToday survivor's on the Indonesian island of ... see her dealing with the destruction of friday's left behind as we go to air the official death toll is over eight hundred that number is likely to rise to over one thousand\nOfficials have been burying the dead in mass graves Rebecca ... is the BBC's Indonesia editor we reached her in Palo which was hit by the tsunami\nThat can can you describe but you're able to see in town right now\nAt the moment I'm standing on one of the main route Haiti in to the worst affected area and you might hear in the background the sound that have the trucks coming in they having excavated in C. B. S.\nThe recent day that people being taking food the rent will within their hands that has been in this heavy building quip meant to try and rescue divide\nAnd also to find ... in the rubble of houses that were destroyed by that powerful quake on friday and then also washed away by this now made that was triggered by it\nDo they still believe that they can recover people alive or is this a recovery operation at this point\nThere has been some rescue attempt in the last forty eight hours that has been successful in one place to get it in a horror\nTales hates holy hotel that collapsed the hotel owner was saying yes today that he was still hearing people\nYelling out for help and Denise rebel but he wasn't able to reach them they did manage to rescue more than twenty four people vote using their hands from that hotel\nBut as the days continue the hope of finding\nPeople alive I Would have to say now claim\nYou have been able to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's being cared for and how they're being cared for wouldn't tell us to tell us what's going on there\nWould be to some of the small medical clinics\nAround ... situation a very bleak and there's no power to the entire town so\nHospitals any coup clinics set time too complicated operations are they running out of medical supplies and in most of them the ones that we're being Tuesdays rows of both parties in plastic bags\nIn one that we went to there was a young girl a five year old girl that they had found a loner and she had a broken leg and was crying out in pain on a stretch and not far from the body bags\nShe could remember her name but she didn't know where she lived to where the parents were served to\nHospital was ... and the low cost her and more to try and find relatives ...\nHow many more cases are like the other families or has been split apart they can't find their children are people who are missing\nManny's raise like that as we were traveling in lots of people were trying to get in to find relatives the one mother I spoke to was trying to find her two\nTeenage children that study in ... and she hadn't heard from them people also trying to get into town to to get relatives out of here people are desperately trying to leave the area because of the power shortage is no clean water did both these meetings too easy\nIs right so the roads the into the city I completely up packed with Trump fake both\nAnxious relatives coming in and people fleeing the area\nYou're an actor hospital are people able to get treated or there are people that are are there enough beds are enough accommodation for those who need assistance\nNo there isn't I talked to said they're\nAnd some of the things that had been set including by your former boss James Comey is that the the leads that were presented on Thursday to an investigation would be\nEvidence that a judge Kavanaugh\nMay have lied during his testimony that he may have not been\nFully open about his drinking habits and about his problems in that area of alcohol what investigators want to know about that would that be something that you need to know more about as to what we're judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits while he was in in high school and in university\nNot necessarily accept that it's important that anybody up her confirmation for Supreme Court seat before the Senate Judiciary committee be completely truthful\nSo oddly the underlying conduct whether he drank or drink to excess in high school might not be all that relevant but whether he was honest with the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking habits I think is relevant\nAnd then there are also the references to the year book that was presented that remarks that were sent about ... cabin out at the time and that he said we're references to drinking when in fact I said no they were\nReferences to sexual activity and some of it quite quite awful about what they might have done or why you do to some women so whether he did or didn't do any of those things that what matters in that that he may have misrepresented what that book was saying\nTo be clear some of the underlying conduct if he assaulted women is absolutely disqualify\nA no ifs ands or buts about that on the other hand if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still very important that he'd be honest about it before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIf however the underlying conduct is um the way he treated women whether he sexually assaulted or abused them in some way or that matters a lot and uh that's why you want a full FBI and\nAbout right we'll be launching Mr Rosenberg I appreciate speaking with you thank you\nCarol thank you for having me on the show and thank you for giving me a chance to talk about the FBI\nTaken by by\nChuck Rosenberg is a former senior CIA official who we met his office in Washington DC\nGive me you know\nAs you say hey why don't you die ...\nIs a God Knows I mean\nYou got us MCA [noise] how'd you heard by now that is the new name for the renegotiated version of NAFTA and that abbreviations awkwardness has many people annoyed for in the case of Financial Times writer Alan Beatty\nNearly serious so media exploded on Twitter trying to stop people from referring to the U. S. M. C. A. as an acronym because he says it cannot be pronounced as a word\nWe reached howling bt in Brussels\nAllen us NCAA doesn't really rolled off the tongue doesn't\nIt\nDoesn't you know some of us who care about language as well as trade deals are kind of disappointing 'cause there was not think the single word you know you could adopt into slogans like after we don't have to that kind of thing and not just for the first part of yet another abbreviation that you can't really say well\nOkay but you've taken these ones that you don't not just kind of disappointed you're mad because why because people are using it\nI'm a mad because of how people using it I'm also not because people say acronym when they mean abbreviation and you know an accident was a thing you can say laughter is an acronym us MCA isn't it'd be patient and I just I don't think we should give it revisions the name of acronyms cause they happen to them\nBut they said that you say this is a hill that you're willing to die on\nI'm coming up soon why [laughter]\nWell I tell you why I've covered shade from will in ten years okay when I started a as a journalist when I started covering said I really like this is the subject so complicated that the ... and stuff and running into full after the fall that basically all the stuff I've covered it into three left merits grown in Florida and so keeping in your head\nAll these enormous it'd be patients when you came across one that you could she said was shipped off the acronym you really want to sort of hold onto it um it's sort of the fact that this is gone and dissipated and they put me seems to be out of angry about it that I just find it very surprising\nNow of course people are arguing that in fact you you can turn it into an acronym you couldn't say ... or ... or something of that nature right I mean it's not all is not lost on\nThe realities of our shortage that's a problem with the violence will see is the ... I'm\nTwenty three vowels in this there's like well I guess it's a it was not going to the guy you came\nTo that in the inconvenient tries to either end you see what you really need is some kind of out in the middle east you all people invented say either for you in a in the middle so suddenly as you just said it was ... as it was some car or something like that one other thing I've noticed which is unbelievably deceitful and these people just switched to Constance\nAround um and so people are kind of guy he didn't say it was more like you you could say it was like no yeah however that just has to be wrong because the constant suing the wrong or okay\nHere's some way to get the next to uh\nTwo letters Canada C.
