C. F. F. revenues\nAre expenditures are projected at this point at six hundred and fourteen million\nAnd we will continue a pattern\nI'm projecting to continue the pattern of deficit spending unless we have um we take certain actions and an Eighteen Nineteen we did in ... we did have ... implement a like a cocked to um to central office budgets of about five point five and a quarter percent\nAnd that's reflected in the expenditure number that you see here\nUh but obviously that was not sufficient to um to bring us a into balance or to bring our budget into villains so with that Fifteen million dollars that would be projecting to end the yoga with\nA rather a Fifteen million dollar excess expenditure over now revenues that will dip farther into a fund balance so that we are protecting to end\nThe or with a thirty five million dollar fund balance and then in Nineteen twenty and twenty Twenty one or you can see that on balance it's gradually or steadily eroding a because all expenditures are are outpacing revenues\nUm and uh that's a general recognition that the rising pension costs and health costs are on our own ... lodge contributed to this to the ... the two of the increasing expenditures\nSo by twenty Twenty one we're projecting that will be significantly in the red baby will not even meet a two person was a result requirements obviously this is not a pattern that we that is sustainable and all of the state allow this I'm I'm a ...\nTo happen so we have to take some um make some interventions and as I mentioned as we've all\nBeen bought up to date as a as to what how we are addressing this uh this deficit [noise]\nUm [noise] but this is\nA graph of very young without growth in expenditures any and growth in revenues as you can see the the total ball\nA triangle I guess a is a expenditures the blue piece is a ... it's a revenue and you can see from the dotted line study in January we will projecting\nThe four dollars um in made that well that was a little uptight to that of revenue protection on a ... per pupil basis that for Seventy two envy and in June when the budget loss actually signed\nA ... ... all Elsie affect revenue provided us with five hundred and forty seven dollars increase this is a revenue increase from the previous year or five forty seven\nHowever that five hundred and forty seven dollar increase in revenue is as you can see totally eat enough and then some by a expenditure increases I'll ... stuff of which is increasing at one point eight five percent each year\nOr it's costing us about Ninety dollars a pop ADA another twenty two dollars put an increase in all in all the classified as the first time and\nI'm contributions the increase is enough stepping column a sixty two dollars increases in health and medical of Nineteen dollars\nUm special ed in special ed transportation increase by a hundred and Ninety seven dollars for eighty eight and a salary increases that we've implemented in Eighteen Nineteen uh ... are at about ... eight hundred and Seventy three dollars by ADA\nAnd then you see that the deficit is revenue five forty seven a revenue increase to five forty seven and expenditure increases of a lot of one thousand two hundred and sixty three [noise]\nUm I mentioned I referred earlier to the increase in the in the uh accounts does contribution rate so employers and you can see that it started with the fourteen Fifteen\nOr two thousand fourteen Fifteen that the employer contribution rate went from what it last for a very very long time it eight point five percent to a point eight eight percent there was a point six three percent increase it cost us a million trees at ... at one point three seven million at the time\nOf unrestricted dollars and then you can see the steady increase each year off one twenty five percent all the way into Nineteen twenty and then I'm a point nine seven percent increase 'em in twenty Twenty one\nAnd a current uh salary levels at our current level of payroll um these increases in ... on a cumulative bases will cost the district about twenty six point seven million dollars in total\n\nOur health and pension costs also um as a percentage of payroll\nUm the black line is our a pension costs are those are steadily increasing ah in fact it's doubled over the ten years this is the ten year trend from a two thousand eight to two thousand ah two thousand eight nine to Seventeen Eighteen\nOr the year that we just close the books are and it was a set of seven point six percent of payroll\nUm and it's at a protein point six now are these are just so pension ... stuff and I'm a C. plus cost combined a medical costs as a percentage of payroll although have declined from the peak of twenty three percent\nAgain if you look at it um as a as a percentage of payroll yes that's a decline because of payroll has increased so the um the health costs have not increased as as rapidly as payroll to that there is a\nDecline in the percentage but in absolute terms I feel as I'll show you from ah in the next slide 'em there is there are actual dollar increase us here over here in both on medical any no pension costs\nUm the grass on the left or the buck wrap on the left is shows the increase in pension costs or the blue\nGreece us at all or rather costs and I'm\nA ... and the red orange bar is a a classified fuss cough\nA man and if you can see ... and in all eight or nine cost of about twenty two point six million dollars and it said fifty three point eight million for more than doubled in ten years\nThe graph on the right or shows our um pension call US Army medical costs are both are active employees as well as our our retirees the blue line in the bottom is the medical costs fall covering up a bit of our current retirees\nAnd the a red line is the um if the costs are up for active employees\nSo that also over ten year period when from a total of five Seventy eighty million too close to a hundred million dollars\nAnd\nWill be will have questions like you for the presentation to questions from commissioners and we have no public comment on the side [noise] parishioner malarkey\nThank you for the presentation of in terms of a spending how much of this is going to lump sum\n\nHow much of the general fund money is going to lawsuits yeah\nHow much are we spending on him last year\n[noise]\nSorry\nI thought you would have

happened\nThat we look up they can make nothing happened and everything that a tool and like I remember like what we looked at Richard what are the guys and they said oh my God we spray painted a wall actually I\nWas so scared like are we going to get caught like I don't know I wasn't fair to say that look around and they told me to come downstairs and it got feelings I get that God fearing\nAnd I open the door and they were just sitting there and they showed me they and they said is if you and I was like yeah yeah that's a good\nLook you admitted it\nIn judging from what you've told me you know you did something stupid but to go when you when you explain that to type police what did they say to you what what what's your sense as to how they're treating this\nLike they like I'm very apologetic like I'm I'm so sorry for that and like really stupid but I can get it and they they're better to punish me for it like a tree company that gets me is fine but I don't think it's just kind

Thailand\nOr\nMy\n\n[noise]\nFraud extortion and witchcraft\nThose aren't the charges against a Milton, Ontario psychic she stands accused of ... people that have tens of thousands of dollars which explains the fraud and extortion charges\nBut she was also charged under section three six five of the criminal code pretending to practice witchcraft and our tax provision that could soon be cleared from the books\nHoping regional police detective constable Sarah McCullough investigated this so called psychic we reached detective comfortable McCullough in Milton\nDetective constable McCullough why is this psychic accused of doing to her clients\nWell we had a victim come forward that had been um she claimed to have been to friday to ah just over sixty three thousand dollars in cash and property and\n[noise] uh you were going in for your original psychic reading and after that psychic reading she would tell you that you know she's sensitive that energy around you or she's sensitive curse and she used that and said that for six hundred seven hundred dollars\nThat you would pay to have her do rituals and cleansing in order to take away the bad spirits\nAs she would gain your trust she wouldn't a asked you for you know a couple of thousand dollars so that it can be blessed and be return choose and in order to gain their trust you would actually give that money back\nAnd then over an extended period of time she would start to ask for larger and larger sums of money which would get into the thirty forty thousand dollar range wants the victim would start to ask for the money back [laughter]\nShe would say that bad things would happen to bad things would happen to her family and then eventually just stopped returning phone calls\nNow obviously the clients who who went to her believes in these sorts of powers but are there any other characteristics of the ... people have who were willing to hand over so much money to essentially a stranger\nTypically these are very vulnerable people there in a very vulnerable state in their life\nThey've either gotten a divorce going through a divorce have lost a loved one suffering illness within the family or an illness themselves they're searching for answers are searching for anyone that can give them any good news or reasons why this is happening to them\nNow you have this original accusation and then you move forward with other people who claim the same thing was it difficult to get these more people to to come forward with these claims\nI it was it was very difficult at the very beginning we only had a few victims and some people were too embarrassed to come forward and too embarrassed to move forward with charges\nSo that's why we had one great victim that uh we were able to glean a lot of information from and were able to charge the psychic with extortion fraud over and the witchcraft fortune telling charge\nAnd then now because that's been in the newspapers and we've been able to get it out there a lot more victims have been willing to see and not be embarrassed to be like wow this happened to somebody else okay but it's also happen to me and they're more willing to come forward and I still believe that there are far more victims out there\nAnd I'm urging them to come forward and speak with me\nRight now these of course are just are allegations so far there haven't been proven in court but you hope to move forward with them\nUm and and and the charge that that your mirror moving forward with this is a fairly obscure the witchcraft charge why did you decide to use it in this case as as opposed to just say fraud or extortion charges\nThis one truly that we understand that and this is an old charge that the wording may be a little bit off on it tends to throw some people off\nBut this charge we want people to truly understand that it is not illegal to be a psychic it is not illegal to have a psychic practice is\nNot illegal to practice any religion that involves witchcraft a weekend pagan for example or anything like that these are not the people that we're after this witchcraft charge is because it is\nFor our gently so you know somebody is fraudulently telling fortunes for money and that is the charge so it's under the fraud portion of the criminal code and this is exactly what she did she was\nFraud gently telling people their fortunes for money so we felt that this charge truly did fit what she was doing and it it explains more than just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
