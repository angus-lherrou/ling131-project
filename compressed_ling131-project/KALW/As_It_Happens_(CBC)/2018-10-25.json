paper ballots and confused vote counters so much that the Supreme Court eventually had to decide the election well as a result in two thousand to Congress passed the help America vote act\nIt set new voting standards and gave election offices a bunch of money mostly for new electronic voting machines but within a few years election security officials were asking for a good old fashioned paper trail\nAnd so at that time around two thousand six a couple of vendors quickly designed a paper trail if they sort of just slapped onto the equipment and it just didn't work\nThat's Dana ... she runs elections in Travis County Texas which includes the city of Austin\nIt was a rather gigantic failure if you can imagine a voting system with a cash register tape under glass this was now most of the voting Arctic trails were developed very quickly that paper trails failed by the wayside and for many years\nWhat came after was a reminder this failed one vendors we're not going to try it again\nAnd

including the fact that it's too expensive so we we wanted it to be an open source system\nWe wanted it to be very easy for voters either so it had to be something that they could take the paper out at the machine and look at and examine themselves\nThat system would let both voters and election officials verify that votes were cast correctly after some heavy lifting on and designed to before I

singled out by Donald Trump in tweets and didn't speeches but today the U.S president toned down the rhetoric when he spoke about the attempted bombings at the White House\nSo full weight of our

about it from her team\nThe first thing I thought of was I'm Glad it was intercepted by second thoughts after being happy that they didn't detonate was this is a climate where this was hardly surprising\nIn fact can you treated shortly after President Trump this is on you what do you mean by that\nYou know he has a unleashed a hatred in anger theory that he feeds off of that he had no way tries to update if in fact he at times has\nCondoned it and excused it obviously this person is trouble um even if they're saying you don't send bombs in the mail people but it doesn't take much for someone to think it's okay for me to do something\nYeah I mean I I take your point we've we've heard the president called the press the enemy of the people\nAnd lean chance of lock her up during the last election but we've seen other kinds of incidents of violence or attempted violence in the past some numbers the Oklahoma City bombing in Nineteen Ninety five I mean is it fair to say that the president incited this kind of violent\nBut we've had so much support coming in from around the world really ... and I'm surprised that guy I don't know so for me do that well but I'm surprised that

your mental actual home and community\nI've always been very happy with our community like you know and it's been a very supportive community anyways and it just feels like our community has expanded

see the report on line I guess our community goes way beyond any borders that you can see\nYeah that's normally now the artsy NPR still investigating do you think they'll get any answers\nI Hope so but I seriously I have my doubts there's there is some evidence I'm not a lot there was some evidence recovered and [noise]\nI don't know it it doesn't to me it won't point to any direction but then I'm In law did not field work so they they may have more ... than I think but Mm\nWell Mr Hampton I I Hope they're able to find out who did this and put an end to it and I'm Sorry for your loss\nThank

creator has died at the age of Ninety two darkest Riley was the supervisor at the camels Test Kitchen when she invented green bean casserole in Nineteen fifty five\nLucy long into food folklore ... who has looked at the enduring popularity on this particular casserole we reached her in Bowling Green Ohio\nProfessor long hounded door kiss Riley come to invent the green bean casserole\nShe was at work is Riley was trying to come up with so just shown to help people could use a product that Campbell Soup was already producing so she came up with the idea of using this as if it was a white sauce\nPeople were already making God for all types of things so it was just a matter of you in the canned food and sort of making it from scratch\nAnd was it always intended to be a Thanksgiving dish\n[laughter] oh you know I ... I don't think so and the Midwest history quietly news for everyday meals as well as ... bought a family gatherings in general so by is not only the Thanksgiving here\nNow as a kid I had a lot of frozen green beans and cream of mushroom soup but never to gather um what what does what does the green bean casserole tastes like\nA it's a it's like green beans next done with that [laughter] so\nYeah it's a and I think if people didn't call it a casserole they just think of it is green beans with white sauce\nDo you like it more than in small quantities [laughter] so\nAnd there are variations we make the heat and very Asia and then you can do it very upscale\nSomeone described the original recipe on Twitter as tasting like what cigarettes would you agree\nNo it's not that bad [laughter] if\nIf people don't like their food mixed together they're not going to like ... and ... and a casserole are kind of stereotyped as being something that\nHealth wise and and the west may they became very popular in the night and have you here when those magazines all sorts of stereotypes and jokes about casserole is in general\nRight now the dish only has a handful of ingredients and it involves less cooking and more combining of these ingredients this recipe get to be considered iconic when really it's not much of a recipe\nIt doesn't require any polling Harry training at all which is part of the reason many people dismiss it as not being real cooking but it's also part of the reason that it changed so popular it's something that anyone can make\nAnd you're guaranteed to have an edible out on\nUm it might not be as hate is some people that liked but people who don't have a lot of money to experiment or they have expensive ingredient by take we're making some done very elaborate and then it doesn't work and they have to throw it out we bean casserole always works\nIt's hard to think that a recipe like this would be a hit today\nObsession why do you think the green bean casserole was such a hit in mid century America\nIf you keep in mind that the Nineteen fifties was following on in the wake of World War two\nThere was a sense of everyone wanted to be eating this fall I didn't want to have exotic or things that were censored too to Bahrain\nMuslims have to cut cut across all socioeconomic level so if you wanted to make it add things that were very expensive you could you know but the basic ingredients were very inexpensive\nPills so this is a very democratic type of dish\nOn as very conformist which is what people in the Nineteen fifties wanted\nAnd and it became a tradition and in this one that is still popular today a particularly around Thanksgiving isn't mainly ... do you think\nI Would say in in some places it is not at all because\nIf it's something that you know the mothers and grandmothers from the Nineteen fifties were making and then it just became part of family tradition um I think in in the mid west that it represents the industrialization industrialized agriculture that characterizes the region\nOn a lot of the food processing factories are in this area you know so that when people say eat local you know then the the Campbell's Soup factory that ... there's one that's about thirty five minutes away from the ... local\nTime usually\nWhat wouldn't even know if it is part of the local scenery and as part of people's occupation is part of the landscape\nDo you think it's important that people know about darkest riling that she was the one who came up with a recipe\nIt's always nice for people to get recognition but I think it's important for people to realize that food is that our invented for commercial reasons can become something that is personally meaningful and it can be part of\nFamily tradition mhm and it can be part of a regional tradition\nWill you be making the green bean casserole is Thanksgiving\n[noise] um we usually make a ... version and they get from scratch so\nYeah what substituting the milk with ... ... what are you and\nWe usually we do to use all and then the milk little mushrooms fresh green beans we prefer like coastal flavored all known although although sometimes those sort of Styrofoam kind of an young so you have to have that\nThat literally out of it and yeah the wonderfully greasy crunch at the end yeah professor long thanks so much for the for speaking with me today sure thank you\nWill see long as the food folklore stand assistant professor at Bowling Green State University the inventor of green bean casserole Doris Riley died earlier this month in Camden New Jersey She was Ninety two years old\nWith that ... that the email is ... is in the public demand it talks about\nThat no bones find in the west of Ireland there are no math graveyards in the west of Ireland it's just a load of old finding bones you know there was no apology\nNow they've agreed to contribute to and a half million euro uh some three and a half million Canadian dollars for the costs of the excavation how do you feel about that\nThat that the bones the cooler da da da da da da da\nDe ... of the biggest health care providers in Ireland on the government estimates that the cost of the excavation will be between five million ... million on the bones the coolest thing keeps okay to pay\nLess than a call so\nNo I don't think that's good enough they on the state we're responsible for what happened to two day and the state should pay equally\nNow the remains are supposedly going to be given quote a respectful burial do you think your sister is a is among the bones of the babies there\nWe're very cynical because in in twenty twelve there was a report by the hate to say that between two mother and baby hold on a ... a ... and babies with traffic to America a thousand babies so\nOne of the reasons we we've talked about it from day wall and that they needed to excavate they needed to identify 'em we need finally to be told yes there were seven hundred Ninety six babies in those ... both an every babies being identified\nBecause I Believe that my sister is affecting the five year old woman living her life them what may be counted to maybe America who has no idea of a history a wet she literally comes from\n[noise] if you do find her remains in the graveyard what would you like to see happen\n[laughter] but when my mother died two years ago we never put a new headstone on the grave because I don't want to have stone\n...

T. V. for defamation for reporting those um you've denied this do you think that the two women who made those accusations are lying\nSo I wouldn't wish false allegations are on anyone I Would have wished on my on my a worst enemy and so um it does\nDo I I'm I'm sure there was a a political angle to this of how people were convinced a or cajoled to make up false stories but I think it became very clear in the weeks afterwards the Sox completely fell apart a um [noise] that ah that that they were fictitious are stories\nHave the allegation by women been withdrawn\nI sold a ... well not a I and I I don't want to go in the past but but obviously the people that made the false allegations disappeared in in some cases sent sent out of the country and so but having said that I I I don't want to get\nInto those details day was obviously\nI'm a political um uh attack job and um he TV's gonna\nHave to defend not and that is before the court says so I'd be careful not to get ... get too much into those details but there's a reason there's ... million dollar defamation lawsuit for what was very sloppy journalism the fact is forest all apart so quickly shows that they they could have easily have been fact checked I'm having said that um\nI Want to stress my focus now is not is not going backwards my focuses entirely on getting branch and back on track\nWas part of an interview with former Ontario PC leader Patrick brown on CBC traumas metro morning earlier today and again on Monday and Mr Brown was elected mayor of Burlington, Ontario which is about an hour North West of Toronto\nThe cleanup has been just as heartbreaking as the fire itself last month Brazil's National Museum in Rio de Janeiro was destroyed by a massive fire and staff members sifting through the wreckage are finding piles of cash sadly instead of prized artifacts\nHowever last week a discovery a miraculous discovery was made researchers have recovered about eighty percent of the human fossil known as Lucy how old is too much call us in the Americas it was one of the items that staff members feared was last for ever\nMurillo Bustos was the first museum employee ... we reached him in Rio\nMr Boston is when you spotted the bones of lose the for the first time since the fire what was that moment like\nWell I wasn't quite excited when I saw was here for the first time because we didn't know how she was\nBecause of notify was very strong and she was very fragile so I was expecting the worst and of course when I saw her when I started bonds when Assad that she was in a specific spots but she was meant to be a much very very happy but at the same time\nThat I was worried because she was pregnant\nAnd I wanted to remove her the best way possible [laughter] so it was a big responsibility for me for you\nYou talk about her in a very tender way um what what does she mean to you\nOh actually she's every floor tents for all of us 'cause she's part of our history in Brazil she's the oldest human remain found in Brazil so she's very important for me because I work with human bones\nAnd just like the the pioneer for our so everybody knew her and everybody knew that I worked around her [laughter] I never worked with her specifically but I was working next to her and I had to carry her from someplace and so\nShe must parts of my life so [laughter]\nSo you're at the site of the museum you're surrounded by the ash and runes after this devastating fire how did you find her\nWell I had to answer to abusing of course to finance and the the room she was inside\nI had to cross all the museum at first it was impossible to the days but after the the company there's actually stabilizing abusing\nThey were opening some some of the grown so we could reach her we were a little bits of course because we didn't know if you were in danger but for us we had some of the the university I'm responsible for Dr tour of the university so they told us it's not very unsafe you can go there but of course we were little beach where to go\nThere and there were lots of twisted metal in the room where she was found so I had to cross to jump the ... to to reach the place where she was\nWhich he located in some sort of um a container or wishing lying around her bones lying\nWhatever cabinet tonight or cabinet than I of course the box was broken but I the door was partially open so I could see her and I thought that the the box that's supposed to protect her actually broken probably fired do do this and that", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "25"}
