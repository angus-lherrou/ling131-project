actually committed the murder he had been conditioned to do it offered money if he would we'd kill your son and yet this is that your your son's one of his last gestures is to tell her to run to protect yourself\nWe reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSuzanne you put out a tweet ... ... what do you have to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the ah the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a bound paper on below him that she had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you've not been in the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at um Donald Trump's taxes off of the story that we rode in two thousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day\nUm and we've just continue to push on his finances part of that we examined tens of thousands of public documents we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents from Fred Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should that time stage or implied that President Trump participated in fried or tax evasion or any of the crime it will expose you to my ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump his family and the families empire\nWell we found in terms of the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked up where a Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski [noise]\nIt's getting into some examples in if he would now we just say for instance can we talk about what happened when they do it was huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump has long claimed as part of of this this narrative that he's credit for himself that he's sort of but pretty much up from golfing businessmen who made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and and we found not only did we we uncovered in the documents not only at least sixty one million dollars in loans\nThat uh that Trump extend it to Donald Trump a case as many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... ... more than ... and beyond also as an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid something is his father and there's one instance you give that he said Trump at one point\nPalace how how did he then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nSure I think spent fifty million would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um his father Fifteen million dollars and not that debt I'm instead of being a you know written off\nWas in fact he used it to invest in the Trump power so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump polish and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a fraud that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it is Fred Trump was getting older and to his eighties\nHe he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings and the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was gonna die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent and heritage talks with the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nYou know for his buildings he would buy everything from bridges and so and then one day a company called ... county was created and suddenly all county started doing all the buying for Fred Trump's\nEmpire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is but then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred and the difference on not was pocketed by ... county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it ... it allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death tax\nIs finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that\nThat Donald Trump is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't ... why does it matter what is that in my way does it fit into your a story about fried as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that mythology\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from this this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the myth making him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular call on it was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates he goes to work for his father he doesn't interview you know with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and\nAnd this building that says\nAnd he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan my father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after friday Trump staff\nTo sell the empire the biggest single pay day in his life in two thousand and four was done very quietly\nAnd just finally what was that final payday\nThat year was ... just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly like a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself sold for roughly eight hundred million in and we found through other records that it should have been valued at roughly a billion so even on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than he probably should have for sale\nExtraordinary Suzanne thank you very much making this okay great thank you\nBye Suzanne Craig's ...

Linda ... was one of them after a while he decided to get out of his car and serenade his fellow stranded motorist we reached him Mr ... Linden in Calgary\nEnds when did you realize yes today did you are well and truly stuck on the road\nWhile I looked ahead and I saw a bunch of truckers with their flashers on and became a dead stop pretty much in the middle of nowhere and neither lane was moving left or right at a quick look around one of those semi rigs and I could see cars as far as you could possibly\n... and so what time of the day to day this did you get stuck to not move again what time is that\nWhile I was a leisurely drive back I hit the the actual car rode walk at about eleven AM and that's when we came to a whole stop and it was bright outside and it wasn't too cold just below zero so I didn't feel like there was going to be too big of a problem\nAnd how long were you out there\n[laughter] yeah well I was out there for ten and a half hours and hadn't moved an inch nobody has there were literally hundreds but probably a thousand card easily I couldn't do you just turn around and head back\nWell there's a very wide Meridian in between it's sort of a grassy knoll which was completely and peak we covered it snow are in fact at one point a number of hours and there was a brave SUV driver who literally launched his vehicle into the into the ditch and he had enough power to slide about two hundred meters we finally got on the other side\nThere was actually a lot of applause from people who are staring watching this maybe I'd try it but he pulled it off and not one of the person they're do it\nDid you try no way\nI had a front wheel drive rental car it wouldn't have had a chip in fact at one\nPoint because the lanes were very difficult to see a soft shoulder and my car actually slid just slightly off and got stuck and immediately six people jumped out of their cars and uh and help get me back onto the road which was great because we ended up strict ... pretty good friendship after dinner and a half hours\nAt what point did you decide to unpack your Trump that\nAre right at that point because I was stuck in the ditch thinking I'm not going to get out of here and all these good Samaritans came and it helped push me out\nAnd it just it I mean it was fun it was actually fun at that time of day still and I opened the trunk of my car I gave them all a couple of CDs the Thanksgiving then I pulled out of Trump couldn't it was a little bit of a Canadian a party so to speak\nAnd I said I and many of these cases countries can be prosecuted economically but they can't be prosecutors ...\nAnd I think that's the case for central Arctic ocean stands right now\nI understand you correctly and then these countries who have designed on the Arctic five is they call them kind of Norway Russia Denmark a United States the fishing nations Iceland Japan South Korea China European Union they've all signed onto this\nFor sixteen years this moratorium but they're looking at some pretty rich fish stuck in there that they want to get their hands on so I think you're saying that you can imagine that will be anytime when you could sustainably fish there so what happens is the end of sixteen years and they say okay you've had your way and now we're getting in there\n[noise] [noise] well I don't know uh that it can never have a I don't think you're going to happen right now and I don't take it can happen in foreseeable future nevertheless there is a mechanism for renewal four and five year increments it will not\nBe renewed only if somebody puts up their hands so to speak of says we want to end this agreement you know I think that before we go too far into the future and speculate on what might happen\nI I think the important thing here today is to is to reflect on the fact that this actually happened right now which is just so impressed and I was I still can't really believe that because you're not so much that people would go there today because there's a as a commercially viable stock\nPeople have a tendency sometimes state so Christian companies to go places to stay in ground you\nKnow what I'm saying that I was there so\nWhen the time comes I have to be at the table to have my piece of the pie or ... or prevented here now\nAll right well it could be interesting to watch what happens in the central Arctic ocean a thank you very much for telling us about Mr ...\nThank you very much for your interest by\nTrump retailers the VP of conservation with
