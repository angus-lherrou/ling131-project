although it will inevitably take jobs away it will also create millions of new jobs make production more efficient and kick start entire new industries so the countries that invest in automation early and and the training that helps workers transition to new types of jobs\nCould really jump ahead economically\nThat's partly why automation is a huge part of the Chinese government made in China twenty twenty five initiative that's the country's plan to reduce its reliance on outside technology and create a tech economy that rivals the west\nAutomation is an especially big deal in China because there's so much manufacturing there it's sometimes referred to as the world's factory marketplace correspondent Jennifer pack has been giving us updates on China's parallel tech economy from her post in Shanghai I asked her how big a deal the transition to automation might be for China\nThere are some estimates say that China's GDP will be boosted by twenty percent or twenty thirty of course that comes at a cost an estimated one fifth of change jobs in the manufacturing sector alone will be replaced by automation so that's nearly a hundred million workers who will have to switch jobs\nBy twenty thirty what about\nRetraining one of the things that we hear is that when there's displacement that there has to be re training for people who were displaced by automation is there a sense that companies or even the government is going to help with that\n[noise] I haven't heard of any comprehensive plan China's push\nHas always been towards entrepreneurship at least in the private sector and they've been encouraging people to venture out into the Internet economy and make their own things so a lot of the talk is that what great things could automation and artificial intelligence do for our society\nAnd go and innovate so what solutions abroad is China's government have in terms of pushing automation forward well China's government not necessarily pushing for automation it is however a focus more on\nHigh tech manufacturing that's what they're pushing for under this plan called made in China twenty twenty five which is at the center of this trade dispute with the U.S so they are encouraging factories to use new technologies now of course the by product that is automation\nBut remember this is coming at a time when China's workforce is aging rapidly and a lot of the many factors we've been speaking to when we try to ask\nThem about this a trade to be with the U.S how worried they are the first thing they talk about is not about that\nThey're talking about how difficult it is defined as stable working force because a lot of the young people they don't want factory jobs they are asking for less overtime unlike their producers they want weekends off which is not\nA usual things for a Chinese factories so a lot of these manufacturers are complaining that is very tough for them to find workers and so that's why when we speak to some of these factories they say automating is not so much about saving money it's a matter of survival\nJennifer ... marketplaces China correspondent based in Shanghai the automation there is coming fast

she'll be\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the conflict since Tuesday so is that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and reflecting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nThem from our efforts at the at the post you know we really reached out to both um Saturday in Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can pressure\nTheir study counterparts for information and for answers I'm I'm sure it an ideal situation a there are CCD CCTV cameras and then you know show us the tapes if if the Saudis are saying it is true that the ... um actually did leave then there should be evidence of that\nWhy would Saudi Arabia take him I wouldn't be detained because she'll be\nSomeone who's worked with them and in fact I just saw him\nA few weeks ago here in Washington where he's been living for about the past year or so he has been critical of of the Saudi Government and in particular the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nObviously this is all happening against the backdrop of a wave of crackdowns a dissent in Saudi Arabia\nA just a few days ago some of them out of the economist was I'm charged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly a year as well um women activists plenty of other journalists and clerics\nI'm so this is a ... a mystery surrounding demolish happening against this this backdrop and um you know we were publishing or his pieces in Arabic and I I Do know that that ah it's something that the Saudi authorities are sensitive to them but again I think what\nJamal always told me that he did not want to be labeled as a\nDissident or as a physician journalists he really just wanted to write it and I spent a lot of his his work was even advising Mohammed bin ... mind\nAbout here's what I think you should do we forget that that Jamal was a it was formally or a royal family advisor at one point um\nSo uh it is it is really you know quite\nKingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for defense could make Jamal target absolutely he\nSays you point out he was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed and why why was he why didn't he turned against this particular regime\nSo and it hits the very first piece that I I commissioned and edited for him last September\nAnd the title was that in Saudi Arabia was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable\nUm he basically just saw a lot of his friends getting swept up in the crackdown seesaw friends are being imprisoned or having traveled that as a slapped on them and\nUh the time you know he he wrote out in that area we deserve better than it is and this is again I came to him that is showing even under this new conference total and tolerance for any sort of a descent or or criticism of their policy\nWe know that is Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his power he has as you pointed out arrested\nHundreds of clerics act to this business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released as there is there a pattern that you might be able to give you hope to Janelle ... my my to emerge from this if he is being detained by the Saturday\n[noise] um that's that's the difficult part again we know we know of activists sand and journalists and social media stars that\nHave been held for months a year even before being a before being charged with anything so yes I'm very worried but again it's very hopeful that keeping in a spotlight on his name and on this case both scare us and abroad can can help for speedy resolution\nAll right we'll be watching herons thank you\nThank you so so much\nTurn it to you is the Washington Post global opinions editor we reached her in Washington DC\nIf you go into battle with ... either you're going to end up wobbling down your arms or she will almost certainly do it for you\nIs ... is an arm wrestler and she is strong in her weight clashes ranked second in Canada with her right arm third with our left\nLater this month she was going to be taken both those arms to turkey where was she will compete against athletes from forty five other countries at the world arm wrestling championships we reached I'm a kill in beach Berg Ontario\nI'm or did you inherit your talent for arm wrestling I did for sure who did you get it from\nI got it from both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they were amazing it on my phone [laughter] did you wrestle them\nWell not my grandma but my dad and my mom that firmly and did they usually win well yeah it's more of a respect thing for me\nDid you start when did you start to smoke them um\nProbably around the age of Eighteen and my dad well I use rarely hurt him\n[laughter] so good to practice with your dad exactly and one of those that grandmother viewers\nOh she's still Berkeley and that her age how old is she no\nShe just and their seventies a him to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] I'm On you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to\nYes [laughter]\nSo you okay so obviously it comes into your new inherited but when did you first get interested in competition in arm wrestling\nFifteen Years old actually\nWhat's how does that come about\nOh my God and I uh well and my mom we were invited on this um was Alan ... man for he was doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off camera whoever can beat me\nAnd it's like well free camera right so we went in that and my dad one of the camera\nAnd they offered by parents to go and train with them but they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me to the practice and they saw a lot of potential and they're like you know at Fifteen Years old and your polling this much do you ought to continue with it [laughter]\nWhat did you think about when they told her that\nIt really was um something huge for me I never really had something as big as this for someone to actually take initiative and me is just a a very late in the dark hole basically what about why was the whole dark\nUh I I mean growing up I mean I I really hated my arms my arms were big big arms and I never really liked it because you know dress it didn't fit right church didn't look good\nI was a world they'd Cade and I just absolutely hated my act\nBut then when they said that your strengths look at the size of your arms and you're gonna be amazing\nI actually got a a confidence boost to continue\n... was the most of the toughest part of it what's that when you're doing are much wrestling competitively what do you have to do in order to do it well how what what what makes a champ\nWhat really helps me is if I have the mental power I have huge inside the when I'm going up I'm like oh God you know like I'm nervous just as much as the next person but if you have your head in the game you go a lot further\nYou have to stay very focused on that you're just focusing on you focusing on the are you looking into the eyes of the person you're against or what are you doing\nMentally I'm focusing on the prize basically um eyes on the medal that's my my motives are my other motives though I don't do anything to my opponent I don't like taking them out I'm a very kind hearted person I find I'm doubly happy go lucky but\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is gone through several drops with the same kind of legislative draft or who have worked for the government\nAnd I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to improve it and run with it nothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed\nBecause we're imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nWe will recall that Stephen Harper governments and posed mandatory minimum sentences in six months\nFor uh any pot possession in six plants or less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with Jillian than he know that just while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would say as a slightly hypocritical position I understand that what you're suggesting but\nTruly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if possible so we can write this injustice going forward\nYou think that conservatives will support your bill\nYou know I've talked to a couple of the mind the culture of the justice committee and start dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point a book the injustice and\nI'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and things that might have been\nTreated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas same sex activity there was an expungement bill of as you know in the last parliament that dealt with that and those people who had convictions for that activity I think although very different this approach is very analogous\nAll right we'll be watching this dramatic and thank you\nThank you Murray rank and he's the Indy ... justice critic we reached him in Ottawa\n\n[noise]\n\nIn Nineteen Twenty one a white mob attacked a prosperous predominantly African American neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma known as black Wall Street it has been called the ... massacre and it has been described as one of the worst instances of racial violence in the history the United states\nOver the years there have been suggestions that there could be mass graves in Tulsa and this week the city's mayor said it would be investigating whether that was in fact the case\nMichele brown works at the Greenwood cultural center handguns historical tours about what happened in Nineteen Twenty one we reach ms Brown in Tulsa\nMrs Brown long has it taken into no for an investigation like this to happen\nYou know that's a great question and I think that we finally have\nA mayor who is courageous enough to approach the situation and incident and to actually move forward and bring initiate the investigation\nWe're talking about an event from Nineteen Twenty one of the spring of Nineteen Twenty one that meant that mobs white mob set fire to hundreds of businesses and homes whole city blocks hundreds of people dead ten thousand homeless\nAnd we don't know the whole story so maybe it just to start off tell us how this began began quite simply didn't\nIt did and it's a story that was all too common\nDuring that period the inflammatory accusation that a young black man\nHad a salted a white woman and an elevator in broad daylight in downtown Tulsa when he got into the elevator\nAs he did every day as a ... boy he was given special permission to go into the Drexel building and get water and use the restroom everyday hey countered Sarah page on the elevator this particular day after the elevator doors close and Dick rolling his\nOr her page are alone there's a scream from the elevator the elevator doors open and Dick role and takes off running he's later arrested and\nTaken to the jailhouse slash court house and\nThe accusation is made this our page had been assaulted and ask the story circulated throughout Tulsa throughout the day it went from claims that she had been assaulted to she was sexually assaulted by the end of the day they were claiming that she had been raped\nAnd this infuriated a mob of angry whites who were determined to take matters into their own hands\nLynchings were all too common in Tulsa Dick rolling was arrested and whites began to gather in front of the courthouse angry and upset about what had happened about forty black man approached the court house initially I spoke with the sheriff at that time\nAnd offered to help protect the ... and he told them to going back to ... that he had everything under control and the problem would be fine so they did return to Greenwood but some estimates have that that there were as many as ten thousand white that had gathered in front of the court house last jailhouse\nLater that evening angry and upset determined to take medicine to their own hands and a group of about a\nOne hundred black men returned and this time a white man of post a black man with a gun is what are you going to do with that gone he said I'm going to use it if I have to and they begin to struggle over the gun and during the struggle that gun goes off and at that point they forget all about ... page there's an all out battle in front of the courthouse black retreat to the Greenwood district\nAnd whites slowly advance\nTowards the Greenwood district eventually breaking through the barriers that African Americans had set up protecting their community but because they were so outnumbered and out gun eventually\nWhites are able to overtake the blacks and invade their community and when they do so they invade um Killeen looting steel\nA more than thirty five square blocks of property has been completely destroyed a thousand homes burned to the ground three hundred black owned homes a three hundred black owned businesses completely destroy and not only were they were shooting but they were also dropping nitroglycerine bombs from\nAirplanes that had been borrowed from um a local oil company\nAnd this has been described in two thousand and one report by the Oklahoma commission to study closer race riots is that this was probably the only time that the United states has anybody community than bombs when the air\nThat is correct what\nDo we know about what happened to those those those those remains\nFor what we know is that the entire population of the African American community was ten to twelve thousand six thousand of those people were held in internment camps um\nThat left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that there were people that flat so there's no way of knowing exactly how many people lost their lives but we do believe that um the number is even higher than the three hundred that has been recognized\nWe do not know that there were several mass grave sites\nThat were set up and a lot of that is based on oral histories and what we have been told from not only are a survivors we identified a hundred and sixty two survivors in Nineteen Ninety six that began telling their stories but also from whites that want it to call and speak anonymously about the\nDump trucks that would drive through the streets of the Greenwood district pick up dead bodies\nAnd then go dump them in the Arkansas River we know that there was a mass grave site in Oakland cemetery based on the testimony of a man\nWho happened to be a young boy at the time that the riot took place and he was playing in the area when he saw a group of white men\nPiling bodies into an open plot at oak lawn cemetery and we did some preliminary investigative work there um years ago and that geophysical search\nA determined that there was a mass grave site that there was reason to believe that there was a mass grave fight when we were not given permission to do the archaeological work that needs to be done um and so we're hoping with this new decision that\nI'm from the mayor to move forward with that investigation that we will finally be able to do a thorough and very complete investigation at least with o clock cemetery we are almost positive that we will find a mass grave fight there\nI was reading some of the comments that were on the Facebook page of the mayor and they're making the statement that this is he's the he's giving the green light for this investigation to happen\nPeople riding that they've never heard of is they they their family comes into so they they they they they grew up there and uh they didn't know anything about this and didn't never they never studied it in school\nHow is it that so few people know the history of the story\nWell following the events of the ride and during my conversations with some of the survivors when we're identifying survivors we asked them that very question why did they not share this history with their children and grandchildren and some of the comments were that they didn't want to pass on those feelings of anger and resentment and bitterness that they felt\nAnd you have to remember that African Americans came back to a community that was completely devastated they had nothing but the clothes on their back but\nThere were more to the north pole so that all of health combined\nAnd they decided almost as a community that they were going to simply put this into God's hands and focus on moving forward so blacks didn't talk about it why didn't want to talk about it either because many of them participated", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It
