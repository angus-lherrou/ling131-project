U.S intelligence intercept the crown prince of Saudi Arabia had previously ordered an operation to try to lure Mr ... back to Saudi Arabia from the United states to detain him\nHere's US President Donald Trump responding to a reporter's question at the White House today\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're looking again this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or\nAs permanent resident okay we'll like John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives\nThat would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nOf Donald Trump talking about the disappearance of soda journal\nCongressman and member of the house foreign affairs and house intelligence committee reached him in San Antonio Texas\nCongressman cast and we just heard President Trump said there that he's looking for answers to Mr ... disappearance what would you like him to say that the Saudis\nWell first I Hope that he is tough on Saudi Arabia that he offers any kind of the United states helped to turkey you'll be investigation that ultimately I think perhaps the United States Congress of restoration should consider a treating this\nWhat happened here in the same way that we treated or the Russian operatives who in Britain um went over there and basically uh attack Russians on British soil\nAnd that means to look at the possibility of sanctions for example\nI mean that doesn't sound like that strong a warning did it because he he what he's saying is that well balanced out against one resident of us who that there's questions about put that up against a hundred and ten billion dollars being spent in the country to scale kinda tips in one direction doesn't it\n[noise] you know so far I've heard a much stronger response from Congress both both Republicans and Democrats in Congress of members of Congress are also concerned about Saudi Arabia's rural Indiana for example so even before this happened because there was a ... of the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAre many Italians who ... who wants to help and we've covered the stories and spoken the some of those people and but it's the Taliban government has the support that's doing this and so are you looking for a confrontation with the Italian government over this\nIs certainly not the intention of the project to seek a confrontation\nBut one would be naive not to prepare for such possibility unit so there is a legal team standing by there are no plans what to do so I don't think ... feet can confrontation with the government told police it's really\nSeem to me like a useful tactic but once you shrink from it either I think that we still have to stand up for what we fix right\nWhat about the people who will be on that but what about those migrants to possibly by hundreds to be on a boat or you or are they are they do become pawns in it and then literally on not\nJust really not and that's why I said before that I think the the obvious and first purpose was such a mission is humanitarian aid if their profits and applying for asylum in

rescue ship under an Italian flag in the Mediterranean we reached him in Durham North Carolina and we have more on this story on our Web page CBC dot CA slash age [noise]\nBack\nIt was referred to as the hardest test you've never heard of ... worked for years before they take it they often fail on their first try and on the second and third now twenty three one experts who passed the masters similarly exam just fall have lost their designation\nThe examples given by the court of master ... the group of strips the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the ones on the tasting exam the court has a little else about the cheating scandal [noise]\nCourtney shows all his wine journalist who worked as a ... and some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCutting you first of all what does it mean to us ... to get this title of master ...\nIt's probably the most lauded achievement that you could have in the wind ... certainly not necessary for our summer yet at the people who become masters summary it worked for years and years to achieve this goal\nAnd then to lose the people you had been talking last last is what what did they say these\nI mean it's really gotta fading I have to say everyone can feel it just do a lot of shock and they're really surprised because something like that never happened before and I actually considering that twenty three twenty four\nMaster's family if you're if you're ... to pass this tasting portion is usually the most difficult\nPiece of ... to pass\nSo it's really ... not only for them that for an entire like ...\nAnd the exam is notoriously regrets all three parts of it which is I guess there is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is the most difficult\nFor people what it entails\n[noise] yeah absolutely and that's just only exam itself is the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the quarter master ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and advanced exam which can take several years she passed\nSo by the time that you get to see her master's only exam first you have to pass Erie a separate date and then on a later date you have both a practical exam a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as a ... as well as the tasting exam which is\nSix winds that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white and three\nRed but you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the power of the wind and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is and what vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider like they say that most people ... who can't tell the difference between white wine and red wine is really extraordinary would be up to no\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this part of the things I'm this is the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\n[noise] so we really don't know the quarter master ... America's has not released too much information on what specifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights\nOf the exam so we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the candidates are never told what the winds are even after the exam we don't know if they reveal the identities of the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have\nThat release any additional information about that\nWould have cancelled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they've uh invalidate the results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now have the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go through to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my example particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able\nTo pass this exam I Know that in the ... film that came out a few years ago some estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars\nOn wind to taste throughout the year before their exam\nAnd a person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests ... whatever he or she went through to get there is this is a huge risk need to lose a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other master some ways\nFor the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really were boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone out information that allows them to cheat the exam\nKnow when we're trying to get someone to talk to us\nHe ... a said they just didn't want to talk with you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had\nGained the title of ... and now we're having it taken away from that it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly you want to keep the title that they want to think before they say anything publicly\nBecause one day they may be members again\nIn this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former ... and also because I have spoken to others and I would like to give voice to then if they cannot do so health\nAnd one of them that you're giving voice to you who you quoted in the article one of the ... who lost their certificate or this person said to you I Know this is not the intent but I feel like a marker I'm embarrassed though I did nothing wrong\nI Want to find a different industry to work and now I Want this to be over yeah that's quite a bit and extreme a decision that they would actually leave the profession do understand that sentiment\nI certainly understand that it's heartbreaking for the park and they've worked for many years and they were so proud\nAlthough it's only about a month this person has already started training with a quarter master suddenly it should be a Proctor and be heater within the organization so this person really feel like the ground has been ripped out from under him\nAccording to appreciate it you would speak with us and tell us the background to this story and thank you\nOf course thanks so much by\nCourtney she was always a wine journalist who worked as a ... and sort of New York's top restaurants she was in New York\nGovernment and a a relationship right now it's a it's a it's damage is it through parable well describe your work and should be done on on on a part of a the federal government or a version power\nWhat is that you want them to do and and this is not just in this case that let's say in the development um which below the poverty level in Alabama at what state are you trying to stop them from developing in or or what what level do you want to see an end in an intervention\nWe want to be part of a of this uh the development we want to be part so that it's manageable that they don't have the green light to start to destroy our land and and destroyed a fish habitat and\nHold our waterways uh no we we we want to have a say in what goes on and through our rights that are supposed to be protected\nBy the federal government to make sure that we have something to go forward with for for many years to come and we've never been heard we've uh you know the two thousand and five case with minister a\nShia ... department trying to pick up plans ... and then we won that Supreme Court so you think that this one should have been easier to make for for shipping port\nSo uh I feel that the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash from a from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter which what's a party in power\nThey've always kept a the general public in a dark they don't let him know that they're part of the treaty and that uh they're benefiting more from the tree you didn't know the frustrations are\nAsked at the beginning when you go from here I've seen gotten the Supreme Court ruling on this a national chief\nTied down ... is saying that where it takes you is into the carts over and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lots of lawyers lots and consultations this is this is the future\nWhile you're not just put it this way just wait and see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system and in this country anymore and uh\nYou know things are going to change and a half in really a don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national chief\nWould be working closely with a I knocked to try to push a ... agenda to basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no\nUh I have no faith in the in the system today\nAnd says you're saying the sleeping
