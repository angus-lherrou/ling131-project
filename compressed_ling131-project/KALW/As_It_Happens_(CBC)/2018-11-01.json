should be taken with their design Jamie it's us into the lawyer and author of the new book future politics living together in a world transformed by tech\nHe argues that we can actually design algorithms that reflect our highest ideal\nWe all building these systems they all controlled by humans they all owned by humans they all designed by humans\nIt is not to be on the Ken of Google to make a system that doesn't come up with criminal background checks every time you search for the name of someone who sounds African American because it may well be that if people have clicked on that\nSo why would you build a system to replicate that rather than one which activity count as it\n... it does it gets back to the who decides question though right I mean you are asking humans to make value judgments in order to create better algorithms and some of those value judgments might be obvious but you know we don't agree on much apparently anymore ever\nI completely agree with you but let's just break this down\nJust looking back in the grand sweep of human history there was always being contested values bought humans have struggled for for\nThousands of years is with some degree of oversight or at the very least some degree of transparency about the decision making abilities to affect our lives and in the past they may be kings will conquers today parliament and in the future there'll be increasingly those who write the code the shapes all day to day lives\nI look forward to a time where we can debate in good faith\nThe political implications of Google's algorithm traces algorithm but the truth is most was kept secret just now and if we can get to the last two well the one that I just described I think it would be an improvement on today's because at the very least then we can try to agree that the papa shouldn't just be the enrichment of the ... the Robin the common good as a whole\nIt feels like when you look at all of this the distorting force here is going to be capitalism right like the the reason not to make the algorithms transparent is gonna be competition and that seems to be a hard forced to overcome\nAnd that's a key argument in my book what we have is systems that are being generated developed and deployed pursuant to the logic of capitalism which is fine but actually the consequences are kind of political\nI'm the logic of politics would say at you they should be more used for the common good they should be regulated in the scene where is the logic of capitalism says they should be used to compete and they should be used to enrich\n... author of the new book future politics living together in a world transformed by tack on that enrichment note Google recently canceled a contract\nTo develop a I with the department of

mean to you to seem as baby acquitted by Pakistan's Supreme Court\nIs wonderful news is wonderful news for myself for my whole family for the country but most of all it's wonderful news for us here will be for her family her husband who treated autos and her granddaughter we have gone from the way in writing a pushing right a grave injustice\nOr against a poor defenseless woman we can never take back the nine years of her life that we took away but we can go some of the way in acknowledging that she is an innocent woman and she would be freed\nCan you remind people of this story and what she did this is all goes back to a neighbor accusing her doing something over a couple of water a dozen\n[laughter] yes a few I had a dispute with someone\nWorking on the field and as a result of that dispute that person\nAccused her of committing blocks from me and it took him a bogus accusation to the civil courts five days later with five witnesses all of who was a witness testimonies war or deeply contradictory\nAfter that what happens or what happened as does all this happened we've got so many cases as is that there's a huge amount of pressure on the police and the judiciary\nTo convict the blasphemy accused religious groups apply the pressure\nSo a few of BP was not given the proper defense at the lower courts the same decision was up headed up the higher costs because of religious intimidation\nAnd and and because of these gearing inconsistencies this case is now being satisfied\nAnd he was just I'm a farm labor he's he can't read or write she was picking berries as many women were to make some money and she took a sip of water from a cup a hot day and they accused her as as a Christian\nThe road in this article when I brought to the newsroom did not matter\nYeah that was the feeling that I had and then I think other journalists of color have that you know we have these experiences and these insights that we've been to the table but we don't feel you know seen or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd I'm Glad I mean this is something you you walk down to your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case and so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about you exchange the globe\nYeah so since I published a piece on Monday I heard from\nDozens of journal so colored dots majority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though the representative of not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over at some people have taken on different roles just so they don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nEvoked as a journalist who ten years and you write in this piece that you say there are solutions that are pretty obvious what are they\nYeah I mean I think sometimes there's a tendency to talk about this issue as though I'm well how are we going to fix it it's very complicated but actually I think it's actually very simple I mean you you know you hire more people of color\nYou hear their voices and and and trust them and empower them to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to positions of power on them so there are\nPeople of color higher up in the chain who championed those stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that if you leave then you know you just once you have people of color in your newsroom\nYeah I mean I think that's sort of part of the struggle if you leave you can feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less forced to fight for you know the issues that you've you as as important but I think to me ultimately I felt I wasn't really providing that much help anyway and that might experts have been\nSort of few tile and so it was probably time to go but I just I didn't make that decision lightly\nSandy ... de ... speaking to you thank you thank you\nSunny Dylan recently quit his job as a reporter at the globe and mail we reach Mr Dillon today in Vancouver we did request a response from the globe we did not receive that response before we went to air but you'll find more on this story on our website CBC don't see a ... a I H\nMm\n\nWhat if somebody took your average paperback and shrink it to roughly one quarter of its size and then turned it linked wives who made the words read horizontally you could put the pages ... instead of left or right or left to right\nCongratulations if they did that you have a device of the books are known in the Netherlands where the format was born in English there cold slipped box on this month ... North American publisher released the first slip back here\nThere are many versions of four young adult novels by John Green do Strauss ... is the president and the publisher of ... books for young readers we reached ms Strauss cable in New York City\nThis just gave a what's it like for you the first time you have to have one of these flip back in your hands\nUh they were pretty much a revelation to hold in your hand or you can explain then describe them as we've been trying for a long time but when you really hold one there is just a perfect balance of design and mechanics and they feel like something really special when you see them for the first time\nHave to say when I haven't had one in my hand because I just saw the images today but it looks like something whose time has come we should have come a long time ago\nWe hope so well and they've been doing this amazing ... and the Netherlands for so many years and they've been introduced in various countries in Europe but really in in their home countries where they've done the best\nAnd it it really is the ... to me that they haven't made their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here and they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nJust the portability that were used to and our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like four hour radio listeners\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so they're really not just teeny tiny books shrunken down a they're a horizontal format which you can tell when you're looking at it and so they're very genuinely easy to hold in one hand and flip the pages\nThe spine is not a traditionally so inspiring it as a hinged fine the can truly flipped the top open and hold it more or less flat\nSea you have the ... aspect plus the sort of top to bottom horizontal reading of the flats finding the hinge and this ingenious flee special nailed paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\n... closed it was about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it's almost it's almost the exact same size as my smartphone and so in in the case of some phone smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into it back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocketbooks I never had a positive yes and the taxes and to smell\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so\nWhen we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art directors here I'm at ... and we read ... pages of paying attention to lie in town and they sang and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard\nAlmost any print book and the trade\nBut now that the paper it's different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to is a different type of stationary ... would describe that for us\nAnd it is very similar to and in fact is um it is like Bible paper um the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is historically by trade a Bible publisher and this is an innovation they came up with many years ago\nUm so it does have that same thing paper but they get it\nFrom this one single meal and Finland I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy\nUm we had a a laundering of one of them in my household\nMy son left one in a pocket which\nMost folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely attack so they can put up with a lot\nSo they'd been you've tested they have been used tests that they have made a trio an adolescent boys laundry\nAnd which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching John Green with for us has back list titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and cross it's a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print books\nWe know that they are looking for print title if they're not migrating to eat\nAs some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhen we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that ... nature and that was easy to just carry uses light\nBut then people were then returning to books but again frustrated sort of caught between the two world so are you suggesting that this is something that could be the happy compromise between the compatibility of an e reader and and the the tangible thing who book\nThat is definitely the hope that um it it is definitely true that it is not particularly hard to carry around a paperback\nBut the reality is that the ability to you could slip in a pocket or handbag her purse or a tote you know book lovers like to always have a book at their side I'm at too great way to always have a book with you there just perfect for travelling at all the amazing to see\nYou know people use them traveling and we know that that's the way they've worked before so\nHave you tried doing it as they say you can do it just flipping the pages is just as you read horizontally\nI have and we've had some people take them out and they seem to manage to read on mass transit and hold on at the same time um so yeah you really can pretty much do it with one hand\nAll right we'll be watching for them I'm sure we're going to see them a great ... thank you thank you bye\nJulie ... who's the president and publisher of books for young readers we reached her in New York City and if you are dying now to see what a device ... book looks like flip over to CBC ... age\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them just a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nAnd we tried to contact them I don't think we've done well maybe that's the problem that is right that might be the problem can you just take us back to the day this launch march of two thousand nine what was that like to do that on to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rocket and see the you know our space telescope on top of that that was marvelous and I had an opportunity I was told you could be in the control room bill and say your name over a fire\nOr you can spend your time with your family watching the launch well away from the large\nI spent so much time away from my family building that mission so I said no control room would be a wonderful experience probably rather be with my family and so my family and I\nAnd some of our colleagues from the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile was ... a far ... go into the sky it was absolutely marvelous I used to talk about how wonderful that was at night was the most exciting night of my life\nMy wife said no it was the second most exciting night in your life\nFor the most exotic ... I Would presume that you got married however you interpret [laughter]\nWould you win which is over the years and people said you know what we had a lot of pushback and and you you resisted you if people know credit you with having done that you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted and it takes a tremendous amount of work and I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members our team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of course\nAnd every time we would fail I Would have\nLetter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and I'll be feeling better so\nA few months later yeah I have a letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand there now says project called taps his lunch this is the satellite is going to be watching those dies\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down but they've already found several planets and the nice thing about tennis Kepler was a discovery class mission it was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth comedy or rare just give us those numbers so we can build a new mission which is what kept her get now test comes along and says let's look at the whole\nSky and find the closest planet to start to throw the closest stars and so we can examine them with the James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets\nSo that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\n... appreciate speaking with you thank you\nYou're most welcome by by\nWilliam ... is a retired NASA scientist

spend most of her career fighting for them and now the coral has lost one of his greatest advocates Ruth Gates died last Thursday she was fifty six years old\nMs gates was known for her idea to speed up coral evolution and create stronger reaches her goal was to breed what she called super coral coral that could withstand the effects of climate change\nBack in March twenty sixteen ms gates was on this program to speak about that super coral here's part of that conversation\nWe're approaching this um it it is true but the umbrella time it's the assisted evolution and what that really means is accelerate seeing what nature does\nI'm On long that timeframe and the time to do that in a shorter timeframe\nAnd there'll be ... to do that but the climate is changing much more quickly than coal can keep up with so\nWe do that really through using things like selective breeding when we will will identify the most recently in oil resistant Carl's on the reef fan and and really read those calls that we have offspring that happens best genetic underpinning for\nFor future resistance just stress and we're also using conditioning experiments way we really are trying to\nExpose calls to conditions of the future if the goal of triggering the memories the epigenetic Hoff ways that will then ultimately the cost down from generation to generation\nBut then this is a kind of survival of the fittest\nIs that that means that if we encourage survival of the fittest we reduce the diversity others corals are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we stressed upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that's the pulling back from the context about what we've observed and we continue to observe the call leaks in Nineteen Ninety eight to the media we lucked Eighteen percent\nOff will three in a single warming event that is enormous so\nOpposite effect it is if we stop and stand back and just let things take that course we will have the most severe genetic narrowing the ...\nThe entire collapse of reach for them and I'm not willing to tolerate that and so as a biologist I'm going to throw everything I can possibly throw\nThis problem and and off the question can we come up with climate change adaptation strategies for corals that could potentially allow us to stabilize
