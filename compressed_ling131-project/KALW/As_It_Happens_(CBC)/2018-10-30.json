I guess is that we've been worth it to try to do this on Facebook as their potential for it to get\nBetter when at the big criticisms of Facebook is that they haven't shared enough data especially with academic researchers but also to some extent with fact checkers so it's really hard for me to say if things are getting better or worse\nI Can't say that subjectively it does feel like there are fewer outrageous pose being shared as real news on the platform\nSo I Am an optimist and I do think that if we have robust fact checking on a platform that the quality of information on that platform will improve\nWhat do you think happens I mean there's one argument that everybody participating in fact checking program is basically just training Facebook's eventual artificial intelligence you know like what happens when Facebook says great thank you we've learned enough about you know how to detect false information and photos and we're just going to bring this into our machine learning\nWell I think that's a great outcome than we can move on to other types of fact checking\nBut overall I feel like this is a problem to be managed rather than solved\nIf you look at history if you look at other technologies such as the printing press there's always been problems with misinformation and the need for people to find ways to mark sources as\nCredible and authoritative so I don't see the problem that's on Facebook is going away it can get better but it's not going to go away\nThat the end you hold an editor at politifact tomorrow we'll talk to the producers of a new

what must have seemed like hell we reached crispy gamble a home and can do some scotch one and a warning some of the details of the story or graphic\nCushy how you're feeling I'm doing okay some days are getting some days aren't too bad\nWhat happened tell us a good one to sue the story okay\nSo I'm the one day my ... my husband was having a shower and I'm In the middle of the shower the water stopped working and he comes out it's like we have no water and I'm like oh okay\nAnd so he found his father in law like his dad and my father in law to come up and help them figure out why we had no water 'cause we have a well and if there's no water that means that well it's not working so the next day my father in law came up\nAnd uh they were trying to figure out why this well wasn't working and and uh\nSo my husband being like six foot two um wasn't\nAble to sit down to well my father in law who said he could go down the law but I told them not to because I didn't want anything to happen so I took one for the team and I was like well I'm small enough I could\nProbably fit so I got caught the job of going down well\nAnd I'm the first time ah we had a ladder connected to attract with a total rope and then he just lowered the ladder to where I needed to go and take the pump off and that was fine I was doing the work and I got out of the wild they took the pump to the to town and it ended up that\nThe pump wasn't the problem it was\nAt the pump was fine so they come back and they're like um yeah you didn't have to go down the well\nI like seriously they're like yeah\nBut now you have it back down to well again yeah and they're like but you need to go back down because you need to come back and I'm like oh okay\n[noise] so I'm like yeah sure it would never have done it once I

half naked [laughter]\nGoing down as well like download as well and um the water is like really really cold and when I when the law to sell my leg got caught and one of the rungs the ladder\nAnd so when I hit the water or the water kept my legs from like um kept it really cold and stuff so I didn't feel it and um and then I was like you know I went into survival mode\nYou were down there how long before some of those three and a half hours on my gosh in this freezing cold waters yeah this is like hypothermia territory yeah yeah so you are okay with the cold and that you consume consume yeah\nI um I asked they were like well do you need anything I'm like yeah and I'm like I said I'm like I don't have a shirt on and I'm so I'm like half naked can you only down a blanket her shirt or something and they did but then the blanket got caught on the top of the ladder\nAnd I was just like oh my gosh and so how did they get you out of their\nUh the the I had to wait for the um the fire truck in the ambulance and everything and then they're like okay we're going to hand you were going to send down a harness and then they called me up that way\nAnd you get to the surface you found out the least of your problems was can link\nYeah 'cause when I got up then might Ansel down\nSo now I'm like literally buck naked\nAnd then um when the pants on down the screwdriver that I was in the pocket when I went down it ripped me from ... to hip so I'm the patch was keeping my insides all out but once it fell than the it let out and I'm On my entire center coming out\nAre you serious just as bad as or lifting you out the parents come down and and your your guts are spilling yeah and so you ... what did they ... they didn't make a full recovery what's what's the prognosis\nUm yeah they

the deal the stomach ... wall was ... or the outside to the news to him but we know damage to the ... you\nKnow they checked at all and like you are so close to like there was no damage done on the inside\nAnd yet what lasting effects do will this have\nThere's probably just going to be like I'll have like ... if it's really cold which it's going to be um I'll probably be able to feel it in my leg and stuff I won't be able to lift too much right now with the incision and stuff so I Can't do cleaning\nOr stuff like that I Do I'm I'm walking with a Walker and then I have a wheelchair if I
