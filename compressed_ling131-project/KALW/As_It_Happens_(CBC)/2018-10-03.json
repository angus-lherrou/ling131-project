deal was ... just hours before ...\nWhile the conservative said the deal so called victories were nothing to write home about\nThe deadline drama the political posturing it is all too familiar to Kim Campbell\nIs Campbell was a minister and Brian ... progressive conservative government cabinet in the late Nineteen eighties and of course went on to be candidate first female prime minister in Nineteen Ninety three we reached former prime minister Kim Campbell in Cambridge, Massachusetts\nIs scandal how much was this week's announcement of the new trade deal a bit of deja vu all over again for you\n[laughter] well some things took me back to ... the olden days at the candidate us free trade agreement I was particularly that have been used at the comment about the the president didn't like art negotiator and I was thinking of that we should have checked the irrepressible in this article immovable sign of respect your event\nI Do the bulldog I tried to interview him many times\nYeah so um but I Know I think you get those hitters have to have to be tough but I think personally I feel a a sigh of relief because I think you know things could have been much worse and daily and kind of try to territory here with this with this president\nIn fact the liberals are kind of calling in to the could have been a lot worse deal so what is really different do from NASA because this is what's being criticized as well would it'd be really get what didn't really come come out of this he said it would be when when when when in Canada really achieve what do you say to the\nWell I think there are quite a number of achievements the investor a challenge remove all the chapter eleven and a little I think it's good for us\nUm but also there were some things that really needed to be each week to the economy is very different now from what it was twenty five years ago so I think it's not unreasonable to say that there should have been some discussion about modern digital economy into actual properties about those issues and I think those were dealt with of course the big\nTo do will be over the question of access to our dairy access June July supply managed a industry but the interesting thing is that the percentage that are very small just a tweet from more than had already been negotiated in the TPP supply\nManagement it's controversial in Canada and I won't say the word of vaccine there was you know even within the followers of civil their ideological controversial\nAnd I think that these industries have really not had any any competition or any real pressure to innovate\nI Wonder what you make of the kinds of criticisms we heard yesterday from the conservative party I mean it's not the progressive conservatives that you were part of that uses your former party you were\nThe prime minister and the head of this party at one time what do you make of some of the ways that they kind of heavy criticisms amend who's year about this deal\nThan I thought you know that [laughter] I I actually get draft I don't know like I thought maybe I should get some food it before I have to do this press conference\nOr that's wild that must be the craziest day for me because you you're working your way you do all your everyday you're getting up you just you just put pushing that ball up the hill and then this comes\nAlong I live ... exactly it's right out of blood and now as it can be so for a big congratulations to you also for being a woman to win this because the Nobel Prize in physics has not been won by a woman in ... five years is that is amazing I did did you know that before you you learned\nA lot I guess I had never really thought about it you know so I I did not realize I'm I'm a big fan of the gate but Meyer who was the last one and I'm Sorry I just it just hadn't occurred to me that I hadn't been another one cancer\nAnd then the only one on the one before that was ... yes of course so\nI can really be you know I shouldn't be lined up with those two incredible and but anyway\nBut you are [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's what I Will have\nBut you know it's interesting that we we spoke last month's with astrophysicist adjustment Bel Bruno and she told us about being overlooked for a Nobel Prize she was she was one of ... well a group of men and she was the only woman and they had a developed this research and posters the men won the Nobel\nAnd she said to be when they press came to ask\nQuestions they asked the men about the science and they asked her about her measurements and her bra size and she had any boyfriends this isn't the late Nineteen sixty she was a scientist at that point did you ... did you experience sexism and in science in the course of your career\nNot blatantly no I mean you know along the way you know I I've been told by you know men the guy did better that you know I've never been bitten by a girl or you know how could a girl get that kind of mark you know that kind of silly thing but I just always think it's silly when they say\nWell you must have heard the Italian professor I was ... and at this certain conference\nI missed that I should find time to listen to it because I mean not asked to comment on it\nBut oh you should listen he said that this was invented by men and built by men and becoming a ... and that was turning against the men who invented it so this is your profession\nI see it and he just forgot to think about Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home and said there were more men you know that's just that's just the fact um but obviously once you've never you know obviously there's people that are ...\nShould be recognized by which is tripped post occasion what is that in layman's terms or should they lay woman's terms\nIt's the fact that ah at the time when we were doing this work you could have short pulse lasers or you could have high energy lasers but you couldn't have shortfalls and high energy because of that peak power\nHe won in order to maybe blow up an Adam and strip the electrons right off the atom or molecule um if you did it if you read a short fulfill your amplifier you would then blow up your amplifier\nAnd so this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped false amplification did and it's a very simple concept is the fact that we realize now you have to ... to the polls first which means you stretch the pulse to be many you know or does it mean to be longer\nThan you can go had an amplifier because now it just seems like a long pole to the amplifier nothing happens to the amplifier and after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um [noise] stretch that you put on it it maintains it and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy\nAnd and now it's ready for the experiment\nBut that but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get the shortfalls and high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nAs soon as dramatically increased intensity of that post then that's right what what is it they will to do now that the you were able to accomplish that what what would it applications is that\n[noise] well of course many of the applications for scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized underneath the fields in a bigger than what's holding the electrons to the Adams inside later field and so this was a new sort of paradigm to work and\nIt was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a CPA laser for eye surgery\nThis is you know millions of people have had correct those laser surgery senses\nBut they don't all have to they don't have to use that million half yes it is a huge is probably the number one application that still\nWill come on you must be very proud of that\nYeah I mean and that's why I found it amazing that um it happened and that so quickly happening to them that yes\nAnd it's made a difference with so many lives that's what you call you but I don't even know I Know that you pay the way this side of the way down the person I've made I made it possible yes\nAnd ... and there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you Nobel winning scientist is an associate professor at water so when I'm ... I'm ...\nI'm very sorry because I think the university has been criticized for that but I just something that for a flight\nNope nobody told me not to know but you know actually I have colleagues male colleagues here tell me\nI should you know it was time for me to be applying and I said I'll get around to that but I just never did\nAre you going to get on to it now\nI don't know why I kind of hoping maybe the university's left and they'll just give it to me now when [laughter] I don't know I got to figure out a lot of flak they'll they'll maybe helped me fill out all the forms that has to be filled out\nBy the Nobel winning scientist is probably a good enough reason to have to become a full measure\nI I just like to do things that I find ... they're not going to say I never found fun so that's why it under\nThe minister then again big congratulations to you so much things just making this\nBy by\nWe reach associate professor Dona Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario she won the Nobel Prize in physics today as colonel mentioned in my conversation there are strict ones Nobel comes on the heels of\nControversial comments by Italian scientist all of a song through through young to research organization CERN on friday Mr ... spoke at a seminar about gender issues in physics\nHe claimed as Carroll said the deserts was quote invented and built by men it's not my invitation\nWe're being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit CERN has issued a statement saying Mr ... Romeo was immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks\nJust Wade is a physicist from imperial college London shootout at that seminar we reached has weighed in London\nThis weird what was the most offensive thing you heard listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that my defense if if the tokens to say that physics was invented by a ... and it's not by invitation when actually women have contributed hugely to physics throughout the whole of history but for an incredibly long time we haven't documented October ... stories\nAnd we have to be ready castle but we have to remember that it was only midway through the last three that women were even able to graduate from ready prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics is only just beginning to happen now\nThis wasn't just some off the cuff remarks that this professor made and that question Perry this was he gave a series of slides discussing 'cause you can you describe some of the some of the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nThat presentation had obviously had a lot of time taken over it and had done to bake analysis of lots of publications and looked at the track record of men to women comparing that kind of time throughout that Korea and showing the at the beginning of ... an amount of courage they have a number of citations the different publications\nAnd then afterwards is deviated changed the and men had most citations\nAnd ... huge number of programs and the whole way of academic publishing at the moment that is a big bias against women and also against on west and people in the fast ferry stages a pair of you\nAnd then after that that by ... and ... site and you basically when you're writing out to find the paper you cite 'til you referenced the people that you know the people that you're familiar with the people that you say at conferences\nAnd more often than not with men men and they find men more often that she will say site themselves way more often than they cite women so I\nMean that's all of these missiles sneaky by says the decree thing and to make that data no rights and ... is a metric to evaluate at that at the\nEnd he said this is not uses his ... his opinion or is biased you said this is he was proving this with his research said decent physics is not sexist against women however the truth does matter because it is part of a political battle coming from outside what was he referring to there\nWhat he was saying and I think this is actually the most defense ... what you think about it was he was saying that women had and he succeeded in physics all been put into the positions that they ought to tokenism\nSo someone some way that left the liberals whatever he wants to call them had said you know we need more diverse state that just puts and women and ... even if they're not capable and that ultimately ... his message was in and wonder if it's slight season compared himself to\nAnother successful woman who'd been given to position him incompatible his metrics or\nHow did the young women how did that everyone in the room respond\nIt's rainy rainy tricky situation to navigate and if you can imagine that you're walking in a joke which has a short time contract you absolutely need up what you do because scientists who left that are such it's such a privilege to be able to do it and you're doing a job you love and your contract history is at the end if that three is you have to apply for a new position\nSame sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place that welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question I wouldn't do and anybody who wouldn't hypothetically past that I think that would be extremely rare considering anybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society\nAt that point we would simply say that we don't we won't admit the credential that's required Ottawa at that point\nA could could walk around them at welcome them anywhere and of course the charter of rights and freedoms would apply so I'm not overly concerned with that position and I don't find that the street and I don't think that we're anywhere near deporting and I think it's you know I don't think it's accurate to say that we could do that because provincial governments don't have the power\nTo do it and just to make the declassified this what we've heard ... is it there would be and this past winter happened several years after the Iraq to see how can they would have integrated men's language that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants and we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible\nAnd the way that we in the ... circuit selection certificates and of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier olack is looking into forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of clarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the details as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with your crops within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but to be clear to seek you wants integration wants immigrants to succeed and we want throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded\nAnd I think it's in tune with what ...\nWhat about wearing religious symbols slid restrictions will they be understanding the party would not want people in in the public service teachers to be wearing a over religious symbols is not the case\nSo we ... we support the recent recommendation that was called the shark Taylor commission\nThe ... shark Taylor commission was a commission that occurred ten years ago within that report it was determined that the best way to proceed would be to prohibit overt religious symbols in positions of authority so anybody who was in the position to exercise the power of the state would be required\nTo uh not wear overt religious symbols and see a cue believes that teachers in private\nLaw is already the subject of a constitutional challenge and so is he a cube going to go further than that religious neutrality law\nWe're going to have to see where that goes but I'm not going to speculate as to what we may or may not Jewish subjects or hurt me to sort of courts\nWould that I can also be those religious symbols that includes people who end crucifix is\nAnything that would be overt and religious we significant would be something that would be covered by the ... commission\nThis is an election for the first time in years and that that was not focused on sovereignty so what does that tell you about what come back and see themselves in Canada\nI think it tells us that we finally moved on it I think that's a great thing you know for me uh I've been stuck in a in a in a world where we have two choices at a party that wants to stay within Canada and I had one that was shepherd Canada and if you had a you know if you had it going from one side or the other\nYou were stuck there for forever she offers people at different choice and I'm very happy\nThat they must just get thank you\nThank you

five fifty six eighty seven\n\n\nRachel Mitchell is an Arizona prosecutor she has tried many sex crimes cases and she says\nOh a Supreme Court nominee is not of course on trial but he did appear before the U.S Senate Judiciary committee last Thursday along with professor Christine lousy board who alleges he sexually assaulted her\nWhile they were in high school and that means Mitchell is the lawyer the Senate Republicans hired to question both of them following the session ms Mitchell wrote a memo to those Republicans stating that no reasonable prosecutor would take the case to court\nSince that memo became public some prosecutors have taken issue with her conclusion Matthew Long is one of them so long as the lawyer in private practice he was trained by Rachel Mitchell herself in Arizona we reached Mr long in Scottsdale\nIs among I Know that Rachel Mitchell was in ... so what did you first think when she was chosen by the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee to be their interviewer\nWas heartened that was very very much at peace with the selection because of my associations with ms Mitchell having having known her to be someone who cares very much about balancing victim rights and the rights of the accused\nWhat did you make then you have this memo that Rachel Mitchell has written to the to the Republicans on the committee to say that she given what happened she would not prosecute judge Kavanaugh if she were prosecuted in this case\nLung particularly troubled with the memo that was offered from a prosecution standpoint and from a sex\nExpert standpoint both of those are particularly concerning given the format there's no way that I mean closet cuter\nWould including that's Michel would make the assessments of judgments that she did in that memo with the limited information\nThat she was given and that we were given up to that hearing and in that hearing but instead a prosecutor and including this Mitchell would certainly have demanded additional investigation in order to take what was learned in\nThat hearing and to find out whether there is\nCooperative or other evidence the external too that testimony or if there's evidence that we'd botched either of the the testimony so be hearing from a prosecutor standpoint and the testimony that we received from the from the hearing was a starting point and ought to have been a starting point\nShow I find the memo\nDisingenuous at best and misleading\nAt worst because it doesn't reflect the realities of what happens in prosecution offices every day\nThat she's very definitive isn't she she writes in his memo she said and he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove that this case is even weaker than that and she says\nThat there's that Dr forwarded then decide at the witnesses to the event and those witnesses refuted her allegations failed to corroborate then she said that there was none of evidence to satisfy the pondering the evidence standard that's pretty strong definitive language isn't it\nWas a strong it offensive language is is absolutely also misleading and it's misleading because the only witness statements that she's referring to are and you use a written statement it's not as it relates to a interview or or any type of follow up to these witnesses where they're\nUm memory is can be verified or whether or not there the way in
