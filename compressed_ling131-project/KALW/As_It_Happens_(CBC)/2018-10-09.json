Ontario\nAnd made what does that can age ... taste like\nI it taste that well in my opinion page fantastic it's imagined a standard vodka\nBut with absolutely no burn the sweet smell and they are currently finish leaving no burn a few big box of college date but a ... often has said ... sort of\n... which many people do like\nA when you drink it burns going down but ours has done to that it's a very smooth exit\nAfricans they nail polish remover right\nExactly yeah you were going to say [laughter] quite settling down and get [laughter] so what does it look like who looked like milk\nOh no no it's completely clear just like a like a vodka Philip to Ninety four percent alcohol purity diluted let's bring water to Britain it to ... percent alcohol so you could mix it with all your favorite cocktails by what people tell me what is that it's good to sit on its own which is pretty rare Nevada\nAnd has made this was a regular milk or or what part of ... are you using can make the vodka\nBut we're using a call ... ... so what happens is the milk comes into the new processor from all the harms our case we're working with ... that the largest protests are about an hour South Florida what the fat or taken off they butter ice cream and then there was a skim milk\nAnd what they do to make it cheaper to ship the ... good note they concentrate them by taking out the water and when they do that they also take out the lactose minerals and vitamins and that liquid is called no problem yet\nAnd what's interesting is right now they have very little use for it and the vast majority of it it stopped and that's what we're turning into all\nThis ... this is their the farmers just get rid of it it's just think this is a waste product tens of not now can tease and and thunder production\nStuff right I I don't like to call it a wave but it's something that's being wasted right now but uh but no sugar all the sugars\nIs it in that and that's right now the farmers actually have to pay for the safe disposal of this because like closest harmful to the environment so it's an environmental problem it's a financial problem because if it costs to dispose of it I also don't want to watch and see a good portion of what comes out of the cat wasted\nHow do you turn it into alcohol\nWell that's where we work with the University of Ottawa with a professor who live there in the biology department to hide I ... that can prevent a ... most east won't eat it but you know Steve how are you will consume a lot less than ...\n... in ... I think that's like that like any other alcohol\nThat's right well it comes\nTo our preventer so we have a large spill for veterans we felt that up with my ... are we pitch in argues\nThey get to work with take about three or four days to divert the a lot does into alcohol then we put into our student loans when we ... the whole right up to Ninety four percent\nAnd then uh we dog eat that with water can make that bought out bought\nIt feminine were lactose intolerant can date drinks is\nOh that's a great question no not at all so the Big East will Cleeves eat lots of those flew into their basic triggers an equal sugars absolutely no lactose in the final product\nAnd is it something you have to refrigerate\nI don't know at a at the end of it it's just very only defense cuts are being made from er from\nSo and not the respect since ... I've I've variations like it's like ... guys that ... the last nail polish remover and and do you drink ... mix it with something that's what's what what do you what are your recipes at this point\nWhere you can mix and we found that mixes are obviously very well with milk from the ... are also making ... so I think of a bally's on a one hundred percent but there is a country where I work hard and and but also sort of sit in St Louis feedback is\nPeople like it just ah all night so it's very versatile\nThey make a wet Russian I presume at very white Russia [laughter]\nOf course you're talking about dairy because as a new trade agreement with the United states and what that means to dairy farmers here quite upset about that is part of me is something that dairy farmers ... how do you think that that affects the dairy industry\nWell like for example right now the ... was the largest purchaser of voluntary or grain right now the alcoholic freak outs purchased from there so\nWe can make this a popular he could become a a significant source of earth or for dairy farmers which as you've mentioned or under huge pressure right now so if you want to support the dirt farmer ...\n[laughter] and and will you be exporting to the United states\nRight now ah we've built to the ... are sorted out aren't produced well before the tournament to ... we get larger reluctance if this round the world\nAnd let's just stop somebody else is taking your recipe taking this this system this method of making their own\nProblem what people could ever is a lot of fun we spent a year and a half were universities or figure to follow but we we all are people starting to use of of this ... which is currently being wasted so we see a positive thing if other people are also started working with a ...\nI Can't wait to have my first moved teeny oh well we're happy to both of them in a separate deer and I'll do it All right thanks and they die thank you I'm\nOnly McDonald is the founder of the dairy distillery we reached him in ... Ontario and to see some photographs and video of how much how is made do go to our website CBC dot CA such a I H\nOne day I catalogue became nearby immaculate university that vision for [noise]\nA Catholic I'm not a Christian [noise] very much of anything worse what let's just\nListen to thousands six Michael what did that course teach you about forgiveness\nWell I think one of the biggest things that taught me was that to forgive someone is not to condone what they did I certainly don't condone what what Cirque our dead\nBut it's basically I ... I Would say you know not to have a noted is process um the sister sister show gal again are taught that course a Mac and law that said\nUm forgiveness is like quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again so it's you know it's uh it it it is a process and ah\nShe was just so great and presenting things in such a way that anybody\nCould could accept them and explaining the nuances of the differences between condoning and forgiving and and other things that people often confused and ultimately\nForgiveness is ... for the person being forgiven it's for the person who's doing the forgiving and it changed my outlook on life in general\nOn my relations with people especially people close to me and ah you know it's it's it's still a tremendous factor in my life\nIt fair to say that that could change the course of your life\nIt certainly did that's very fair to say\nAnd Peter I I think it's safe to say that\nUh yeah they did I I just got a Muslim just listening to do it again and um [noise] I mean it's it's funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever I'm at the time I was listening to Michael in as I was listening to this interview I [noise]\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and the reaction that he was describing and as\nYou know what I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and a shot at him I just said I said hang on a second [laughter] even the the the message that this man is saying is that the most courageous brave choice I've\nEver heard somebody ever make and it felt like\nThe antidote to this escalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter] it still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so he struck\nBuddy you remember the details the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nYeah I was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spent a lot of time driving cross Canada a lot of time the Senate CBC and\nAnd I would always listen to as it happens and and you know just one of those things that's on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kind of zeroed in on as I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that I was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in of itself I was very unexpected reaction\nBut what really kind of joke to me into action was was the fact that\nYou know like I said that people shot at him and and and called him a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone under the circumstances that Michael last Nick I'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said that to me is just\nJust unconscionable and I need to do something about that and and I need to somehow amplifies message and and yeah the you know the context of it was you know ... or ... was this target and they were like hey we got 'em and yeah a victory um you know mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using\nA I mean I I I I don't want to speak for Mike on this but they were using Nick can and murder of ... or ... as as a reason to justify what they were doing ... yeah\nI and the lyrics of your son I'm just going to read the the course then we're going to hear it later on so people know they're not going to miss that so I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness because men you know that's all that I've got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the rest\nI guess in line to have to try forgiveness ... how did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then as is often the case for me was with writing I I kind of have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to just be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just\nCared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be singing and Michael's voice so I wanted to\nDo it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really want it to amplify his voice that was the goal so I wrote those words down and then I actually ended up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it\nI'm just so I could kind of practice\nPutting words together in the way that Michael put words together and really then just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together Michael ... when you first heard this on what was your reaction\nOr Irish or reserve or call them ...\nAll the negative reactions though I had that someone would have such an understanding of what our men and bishops card doesn't serve a generation or\nThere's respect just over ... still does every time I hear it\n[noise] the two of you became friends didn't you did his door yeah what was the friendship based on what is it just a moment it didn't do did you find do you took a too deep replace\nA loop who is a Knicks Knicks best friend organized to a concert and they created a scholarship in Nick's name they called it ... [laughter] and they are invited me down to come perform at concerts and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania\nAnd I I stayed in a guest room it leaks house where he told me that neck would have spent much time and um [noise]\nAnd then we did this concert and I got to meet Michael we went for a coffee together in the afternoon and then I I played this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or nix friends and family and teachers and Michael and um [noise]\nI'd like to play the song and um I I my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment and then how touched I felt to be able to do that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down in and did that and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to give a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia in two thousand twelve and we've got to spend even more time together then and I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together\nBut this I I Believe a generation difference isn't there I mean you would be closer to nix age\nUh yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess about the same as Nick would have been is that right Michael Vick with the forty okay so pretty close to five years younger yeah\nSticking the singer songwriter Peter ... who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd\nOr a man who was on the line from Norfolk, Virginia and someone who forgave his son's killer in Iraq and uh I I I think we need to hear this song I think this might be so I'm going to ask you to play it for Steve absolutely\nYes me to explain that\n... thing and nothing to say ...\nSome things that happen and once they do then never go\nThey tell you that this life is a nice man you know I think that's the guy who I Will not steal the size of this thing\nWhat I Know it isn't right\nSo I get some\n'cause I Know it's so I've got\nAbout well I did not does not do the may", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
