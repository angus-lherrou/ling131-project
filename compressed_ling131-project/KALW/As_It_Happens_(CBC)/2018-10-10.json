{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "About the work that we've been doing around um our student centered learning climate which is really I Believe in our trust in our teachers' ability to meet the needs of every single Lerner in our building um and I think it's a\nHigh profile comment to share tonight too that we have the capacity to serve the students in our district and in our community and in our city and when you invest in strategy to support teachers capacity development and not just capacity development that confidence around serving the diverse students that come into our classrooms\nI think and we can really make a difference for the students we serve and also in the long term for the teachers capacity to continue to serve the diverse students that come into Iran's stuff thanks\n[noise]\nThank you do all these friends of hers who came in and to many many more um again I Wish we could have a whole board meeting around ... from ... but I'm due to time I am in my ... minutes\n\nQuestions from commissioners come ...\nThank you so much for is that is that's kind of um and I want to thank all their principles for your hard work and it was always good to see the improvement that's happening in our schools and just learning how is happening and one of the questions I think this may be more for superintendent just in terms of cause I Know we always talk about our schools are\nDoing well and they are improving and increasing and addressing the gaps\n... opportunity for learning community are we allowed\nFor other schools to learn from the best practices that are happening in the schools that are successful 'cause I Know every year we have some schools that are proven\nBut what platform have we made available for our schools that are struggling to have some support from these grade schools not to put more work on your plate but um yeah I Know we can learn from schools that are are filling\nYeah [noise] that's one of the um [noise] areas that we have as you know we have lead in place where are we have courts and they have cohort meetings a monthly at least monthly\nAnd what happens inside of those court meetings are opportunities for people to our principles to present what they're doing what they're doing a well or what their struggles are have those conversations\nBut then that's an opportunity for them to learn from each other when we see best practices or we see schools that are highlighted are operating at higher levels\nOther schools have the opportunity to learn from them or the other aspect and then I'll let a bread um\nOr add on to anything but we have an instructional rounds where a groups of principles are actually walking through schools um where we have practices that are increasing student achievement so they have the opportunity to talk about what they're doing how instruction is happening at this school [noise] um [noise]\nWhat's happening exactly in the classroom what's happening with professional development so they're able to have opportunities to learn from each other\nOther thing that I read I particularly with a focus on African American students success within our district\nOr is that the superintendents pitch initiative is also created another learning network that cuts across cohorts\nAnd we're in the process right now working with the schools to identify their particular focus and the strategies that they're going to be implementing that our research based regarding the success of African American students\nUm and then they will also be network with each other according to those focus areas so and then we'll be studying and learning from this effort\nAnd the district over the course of the year we're also doing some additional work I'm with curriculum and instruction around in going all the way down to the level of the classroom where teachers have shown particular success\nUm with student achievement to do some videographer the and also a interviews of those teachers get an understanding of how they are so successful year after year with students um who are historically underserved by the larger system so that's something that we're also putting in place this year\nI'm I'm Glad to hear that and can you just give me a brief of they don't ... Ali fits into ... was just described\nSo Ali the um African American achievement leadership initiative um the way that ties in first and foremost is the um [noise] uh\nThe special assistant to the superintendent is a um [noise] a major\nA player a major component of the pitch work and what's happening is is ah in being in pitch it's both looking at pitch is really designed around looking at those best practices\nAre and replicating those and then um which is a big part of what Ali is doing which is exactly what you just described is making sure that we are of finding those best practices and then figuring out how to best replicate\nA what's happening especially successfully a for African American students so that we're able to replicate that throughout the district [noise]\nI think that as a an institution what we don't want to do or what you heard um [noise]\nFrom our principles is that where we don't want to do is if we continue to do the same thing we're going to continue to have those same results\nSo what we're trying to do is figure out what is working and then as an institution we have to be become much more flexible flexible around changing our practices especially when we identify practices that are working\nThat is an area that we still uh have a ways to go as an institution um [noise] it's\nWe have done things in a certain way and gotten the results that we have a you just heard that one of the things that I did a year ago was um spend time with our school leadership looking at data especially data over the last Thirty years and if you look at\nA different uh um assessments across those Thirty years what you see is that same gap\nOr ... at the estimates have changed but that gap has remained stagnant\nSo it's really a reflected practice of us asking the question what are we doing what have we done and how are we going to do things differently if we're expecting different results and then as an institution when we are identifying practices that are having the kinds of results that we would expect or hope for\nHow are we going to make sure we're replicating those throughout the system and out and I'll you know be totally honest and transplant\nTransparent we aren't at that place right now where we quickly\nOr adapt to a best practice and begin to replicate that throughout the system but that is one of our goals\nIn my last what two more questions problem but um who was the best\nAsking me as the San Francisco\nI'm but I'm from from that standpoint [noise]\nUm Long Beach has made a lot of strange that would definitely say lung which has had a guy\nFor him and the reason I'm asking that is just because again as we talked about shared learning and best practices his core also set up for us to work together to learn what other districts are doing and how they're being successful so are the things that are working other districts we may be able to implement some of those strategies\nYou\nThought that was my comment I had to make which was all the five schools listed in here are the schools\nCommission or um so\nI thank you for publication and thinking two principal for showing up in and sharing with that it's always good to see you and I agree I think we should have more principles kind of talked about um [noise] I I was going to express I mean I I\nI feel some frustration I think because what you just said superintendent that you know we've been doing various thing for Thirty years and we and whatever the assessment we still see the same gap\nAnd in all of my time on this board it just seems like we haven't really made much progress for for all of the investment and the time and effort in and really good work that everybody's put in so um [noise]\nI guess I ... it's it's interesting what you just said I Wonder if you can give me an example of what is a practice that is um that you're seeing in some places in the district that you that you can tell it's promising that that we have yet to adopt district wide you have any examples at your fingertips [noise] so\nThe edge John Muir we are seeing a lesson study process that has shown [noise] um [noise]\nSignificant results with African American students in math or we are so that we have watched that process for the last at least two years I Believe three years if not longer and right now it is in um [noise]\nIt in for schools\nFor schools\nThree schools and growing so three schools and so we've seen this ... process so this is what I mean about our flexibility in being able to move this process um\nSpread quicker is is the best way I can say it um and I am working with staff to become more flexible\nAnd\nDo you remember the never being forty four percent in may and I made it a lot of\nNumbers and say well how is more actually number of stores that were presented in may sip is number of students if you look at this light\nThat was presented in made the increase was that increase the up what ... was presented to you and I'm presenting to you the percentages\nThat go behind those numbers um well it's an domes of red hot I have the numbers your it was a touchy nine and forty three percent chronic at San Diego where he was in the last two years that this year has fallen into twenty ninth which I think\nIt's a double digit um reductions and fine\nWith me now to have a follow up with 'em either of them and vibrant\nGive you the denominator of dance numbers as bad as ours\nIs if you lie they and ours it's\nThan they presented the numbers of students increasing is what they presented within their slides and what we are presenting to you is the heat\nSo that was numbers that book presented during a dummy presentation which also showed an increase in the numbers and what we are presenting to you is the rate which is also an increase in their late\n... percent was forty four percent them or did you did you see the funding\n\nIs are we can pull it we can put up with I mean the the the the ... the disparity in the numbers in terms of like ... percent from two years ago to now is similar as it was and they may\nAs it is now than was started in the school year um\nIt's it's it's been I think even the nice discussion has been difficult I think you you could be clarified it a bit I'm Mr Sam it's been difficult to get to an idea of what is the co he's a plan to address this and\nHow are we putting our full weight behind keeping kids in school so I I Know the situation is may vary but even having a clear understanding of what are the major factors 'cause as a home sort of thing right is it or\nEven be better understanding who who should be carrying a lot of the the\nAre we increased our staff allocations to help support ... sites that had the biggest issues rock climbing up since ... so\nYou talked about a renewed effort that the district needs that um what is the timeline for rolling out a strategy to support those efforts\nOn currently engaging with\nA both Kevin ... and ... about getting a handle on the data um and also the relationship between parties and apps and says and what are all the different ways that students can get absence of for example for a day so that we're understanding what are the\nThe the triggering causes and also the accuracy of data entry has also been a variable that has been a plate that has varied from school to school but it is my understanding is that it is improving and part of that improvement is perhaps also relatives or as reflected in some of the increases\nSo what's we have a a a clear sense of that and then identifying where are the schools that are in greatest need of an effort then um\nI'll be working both with lead and with students having community services and our PA to develop a plan around\nThe school setting targets and experimenting with that or strategies for better communication and coordination and early warning and engagement of students\nUm to try and achieve some reductions in absenteeism over shorter period of time not just waiting until the end of the year to see what the final data showing up so I Would\nI mean I\nOptimistically within a month um boy have something ready to engage with the schools\n[noise] okay when I when I when I um I remember visiting\nCharles Drew than than talking about sort of how things work out in terms of students making games when they're on campus and them seeing productions over the over winter break in the summer and the issues around students getting the school late or whatever the case may be ... when I\nWhen I um it makes sense that that Kevin into district data off this would be involved in this but they're not really in some of the on the ground\nWith all of the schools when it comes to getting their kids in school\nDo we do we have a list of the schools that are suffering the most were kinda got since he has them or they simply involved in the planning process to help improve tend to set their sights because we're not because of what I hear from you know here we'd suing Kevin I don't think that\nThat would be mostly responsible for driving these outcomes right\nThose those schools will be engaged in that process is not going to be something that we cook up on our own and then mandate that they implement we need our best thinking as well about what's working\nAnd not only from the schools that are suffering the most as you say but the ones that have actually made improvements they need to learn from those schools as well so this is partially about shining a light\nOn this issue or so that\nThe the system itself understands that if you're if you're not in school\nThen you can't learn and students who are chronically absent are the ones who are we we see it in the the other outcome showing up in the other outcomes and if we can improve chronic absenteeism we can improve graduation rates we can improve\nGPA we can improve student achievement overall so it's it's a base flying it's a baseline issue that we need to address as a system\nDo you have a sense if it's um how was breaking down by school level is mostly elementary and is it at the sites where we have the highest concentration of African American students or is it the same rate at\nOther bring that at that data back to you or versus making generalizations here I'd rather be able to show you the data\nOK okay do you know I'm\nAs you know eats its foot addict like as you just saw a ... tot which is on this side of the odyssey you mentioned that yeah that it did show a drop of ten percent in chronic apps and kids and rate should that have been successes I'm On the Web site too as well as on the east\nAnd so you do you do know the schools that are suffering from the most then yes is it similar on the west side in the east side in terms of African American students\nAfrican American students uh I Would say yes that aid has been over ... percent a chronic absenteeism on both sides\nOkay so across the district yes there's over twenty percent yes definitely of it as a as a liar who would even as an over forty percent in any school is it over fifty percent any school\nNot fifty but I Know that are some that are over ... percent\nOkay um\nWhat what is the what is the district's up I mean we we we managed to ... we we push instruction how confident are we that we can really handle that so that we need to city support to address this effectively\nSo it's one it's a denim find the issue [noise] ah we have so one of the questions was what are we doing about this and right now I Know that that um maturity isn't here tonight but he has um when he presented the state in the spring we met immediately afterwards\nAnd he was um he was very troubled by the data I'm to the point of making sure that we had a plan in place for addressing chronic absenteeism\nSo uh this was rolled out in the in the fall in the beginning of this school year um but ultimately where what has happened is um [noise]\nYou know you talked about where the implementation ... and it really lies with the school staff so it's really wants to this plan is rolled out then it's worth school staff working with parents and families so right now um\n[noise] I Can't answer the question of whether we need additional assistance until we see what happens with the current plan and is it actually addressing the needs of especially schools where the rate is extremely hot\nOkay thank you\nI think I think this is the most pressing issue that we're facing um we have a lot of pressing issues I mean obviously we we did what a lot but uh\nIt's hard for me to just let the slide you know this is this is incredibly troubling to me that the rates are as high as they are and um so I Would like to follow up where we have a better data breakdown so I can better understand the issue\nOf ... I I really like to see the plan before the end of the year I think we should have had that played out at the start of the school year we knew what the race where in may still sounds like people are trying to figure out what's going on so\nThey stay on the street\nThey're walking like nothing happened\nAnd my father doesn't have any came in Iraq or not even a parking ticket\nAt the same time you mentioned that he has this petition in place that he's married to your mother who has become a US citizen they had filed for US citizenship for him US citizenship and immigration said they received the application they confirmed that\nBut that didn't seem to affect the people the ice police in Ohio they said they're going to deport him anyways\nYeah they they they really rule I I have the the email the they central to um to our lawyer they relive rulebook\nWhat will happen with your stepfather in Argentina he hasn't been there in Eighteen years what will have an Eighteen\nYears and you have no idea how by is my country you have no idea is really really bad and we're really scare\nBecause he used to leave it's like a port town where people are by the you know and\nI Know they can see him like oh look here the guy who is on my I was on Miami maybe he has family there\nOr maybe he has a money\nAnd we don't really care about that because we don't know this\nPeople what they can do [noise] but that's where he's going at this point yes [noise]\nBut I'm so sorry about what your family is going to uh but I Do appreciate the to speak with us thank you thank you take care\n... is the

one he's he's really unlike any other form of vivid design because it's not really looking at a pure clarity on what it's really wanting to do to actually slowed down the conventional reading\nAnd so that's how it can do that so it begins to do that by preventing at talk face which is unfamiliar so that's the ... you know he's just saying that and it slows us down because their brain will spend the time trying to kind of almost sold the puzzle if you if you if you want to think of it like that\nAnd that slows the reading down and that triggers memory and that's why these talks I says being designed as a high last taught face for the promotion of memory\nWhat did you find out what did they discover when they actually tested on students\n[noise] fairly tested across a bet four hundred are much a university students that's the way by and they were given all sorts of case ranging from test that would just sit in the sand and talks like a real hell let it go right through to ridiculously kind of\nA fragmented disrupted tough faces that they'll almost impossible to read and somewhere in the middle of that spectrum\nSense to get a cat which was the end top right so what we found out
