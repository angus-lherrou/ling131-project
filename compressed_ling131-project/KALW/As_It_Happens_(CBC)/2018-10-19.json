most powerful security official and then our guest says was so essential to his western allies they ignored the dark secrets behind this power admiral\nRestraint would vice admiral mark Norman ... to be tried for allegedly leaking secrets to conservative said the Trudeau government stonewalling and they want to see in a permanent documents\nHeld to not pay Canadian CEOs usually compete against each other but today more than a hundred team to oppose the Ontario governments trapping of the hobbies just basic income project an accident\nWaiting to happen and the British house of commons today one of them being found themselves unable to decipher the words of his blood region calling wouldn't stop going for\nThat thing in disguise our gas showed up in uh Toronto park to celebrate the

first ask questions later [noise]\n\nThings are changing quickly in Afghanistan tonight Taliban assassin as gun down the entire leadership of the country's Lynch pins southern provinces they met with the ...\nKind of our police general had been the target of repeated Taliban attacks as a power broker general robs it was considered essential by his allies including the United states and at one point Canada\nBut there were also reports that the generals power had some very dark ribs Matthew ... is a journalist to cover the rise of ... we reached Matthew ... in New York\nNow he has you know there have been so many failed attempts to assassinate general Abdul Raziq\nCome this one was successful how did the assassination take place\nAll the details are still a little unclear but it appears to be um something that happened many other high profile assassinations where there was an infiltrate or a the initial information saying one of the governor's bodyguard actually carried out the attack\nAnd this was the he was shocked and heading to a helicopter he was with members of the U.S military\nExactly this is a high level meeting with the top us general in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller\nA he was apparently harmed but outdoor I like the police people killed as was the um spicy or the province of them will mean and it's unclear what's happened with the governors all my we saw who but a ... at least the injured if not killed as well\nAnd so if we say is also dead and some are saying he is but he we we haven't had that confirmed and now the only time you just mentioned Abdullah ... this is the leadership of Kandahar and wiped out in one fell swoop\nYeah it's a devastating blow up for the Afghan government\nAnd its shore to make the already dire security situation in the south considerably worse\nBut the Taliban and said they've claimed responsibility and they say their target was general Abdul runs it why is that why was he they're tracking\nDo otherwise because probably been the number one target of the Taliban or for many years\nShe is the most powerful or was the most powerful security commander in southern Afghanistan he's in the story is for brutality and effective if the if the Taliban there's a kind of bitter personal quality to it because the number of members of ... family had been killed by Taliban or by rivals you know a lot of these\nThings are mixed up and tribal vendettas as well or an unrealistic was extremely brutal towel that any\nYou know there's there's the longstanding evidence that he was practicing hum torture and extra ... executions\nSo the Taliban have long held at at the top of their list\nAnd it wasn't just the Taliban loses it means he there was a un report just last year that called for his prosecution for allegations of torture disappearance is that the ads that they were methods of torture of\nSo what's going on with the economy is that it's not that robots will come to take your job or what what is not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector that today so today what's happening is that a lot of people just aren't being hired from the beginning\nWhich means which means there's not enough local demand is not enough local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse\nOr so I think we need to look at ... as an economic issue not a social assistance issue it's a way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone and so they can compete on a global level and that can actually find find work that suits best suits them\nKind of person I was like you in your own family is in ... when you when you write this letter\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories intersect with me I mean I grew up in a household that had a hot domestic violence I Wish my mom has the means to leave and I think if she had to be I think maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt it passed in the house the Nixon was going to sign it into law except some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end in in significant increase in the divorce rate\nAmong married couples who had basic income because women were able to leave abusive households than it frankly I think that's a good thing we've also seen that happened in the trials\nIn Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony or we've we've seen the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders and the village can't control them any more\nSo when I think they can come as deeply amounts of paying for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener\nKnew that you would never starve\nYou have this this money coming in and use no shame around the money this is if everyone gets it if it's universal the wave roads and and and police protection at hospitals are universal there's no shame and using that money to to stop tick tick a breather ... think of your life and think of what you want to do next uh imagine the confidence the self reliance the\nThe ambition we can we can unlock the entrepreneurship it can release if everyone can take a long term perspective on their lives\nWill be watching to see if the Ontario that responds to that in just a man is speaking thank you thank you very much\n... organized the campaign CEOs for basic income we reached him in Toronto\nAnd we received a statement from Ontario the ministry of children community and social services it reads in part quote the government for the people has committed to a one hundred day review of social assistance and poverty reduction strategies in Ontario best assist the one in seven people\nAnd is expected on November eight twenty eight team unquote\nWith about a year to go before the next federal election the conservatives are on a push to introduce or\nReintroduce I guess their leader to Canadians and that means that you are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more of Andrew sheer on this weekend the Sunday Edition will be airing a wide ranging discussion between Mr Sharon Michael end right\nInterview covers a lot of ground here's a patch which in which Michael asks the conservative leader about the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist ... ... ...\nIs it most concerning uh international issue at the moment facing Canada would face you prime minister of course is the the murder the butchery of ... I'm In the Saudi consulate in [noise]\nIn a ... if you are prime minister how would you respond to that would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be caught the fact that I don't have the same level some briefings that the liberals have in the primary strategies aware of much more to a story than I Am through security and intelligence briefings and things like that\nI Believe though that this incident should be a wakeup call uh about uh the governance Saudi Arabia at about it's it's um [noise]\nUh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nI that this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this it that the idea that it happened to you know in another country not not in Canada ...\n... the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of concerns about the sanctioning of of of terrorist groups and and and where the money follows a lot of that has come through\nA new entities within within that country and I think this we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I shouldn't say western because in fact struck she's all around the world for freedom loving nations should all come together and say we've got a big problem here if we cannot allow a government\nTo act with impunity in this fashion gruesome horrific ah doesn't begin to describe what happens\nNow there's an excerpt of conservative leader Andrew shears conversation with Michael n right which will be on the Sunday Edition this weekend you can hear the full interview on Sunday\n\nOh\nIn the festivities in Toronto park yesterday there was one character who stood out tall furry creatures that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the beloved character from the long running TV oh children's program poker outdoor [noise]\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature was not poker room at all\nIt was to go to the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events\nWe reached Scott in Toronto\nNot for those who didn't get a chance to see him lettuce took a look like well choked\nWhich I created a parody of and is a character who will talk about responsible drug use now that Canada has legalized candidates\nFor recreational use there can be more discussion about responsible altered states\nHigh end so bet for getting to the description Doug or looks like poker for people who have not seen poker who don't have kids what does it look like\nWell poker room is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called oh could outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids knows about ... ... and it was about ... he didn't know about token now so this is that this is what you you were ... and you I took them\nYes I was the um ... out of ... land for TV oh and they're affiliated agencies and I got to meet the queen has poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol\nAnd um ... when he had his twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\n... that now we never got to hear your voice which is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of the land talking was a\nSort of in some way and when I was told to talk I was given the instruction to be kind of like Julia Child and Kermit the frog [laughter] so it was a game\n[laughter] and yes mostly in send you waited like the summers in their day\nRight now of course we didn't imagine ... ah smoking a giant split with\nNo and uh that would be the evolution of the next generation where ... grew and rainbow grew signature route who is death and go signing and ... who is with special needs character\nSo this was a project that I've evolved the character from and into any Internet program for eight to thirty year olds\nHow do people react you were at the the the four twenty has today this at this well this big rally yeah and um you were there as to canoe as they may just mentioned you were smoking a giant novelty splints and how do people react team\nWill the giant split as it were is probably the symbol that lets people know that it's poker room and\nBecause it is a parody on poker rule I often would get people saying poker ruin I'd have to point to that joint and say you know ... ... but because yesterday was and it was a historic gay people wanted to take pictures with iconic characters a ball man was also there\nAnd I think for the most part if it wasn't taking a picture of somebody's smoking some actual substance that it was the next best thing\nNow did did people know that this is not just somebody making fun of poker you are ...\n... well my children didn't know when I was doing it for TV oh because that was part of the mystique when I actually\nUh talks a lot of a sunny ways and transparency they have the ability to ensure that all documents or at least we don't care what's in them\nThat will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd I know this story was originally published by CDC news journalist at that time was James had more who went to work for a defense minister ... ... just weeks after that story was published is that what you're referring to\n... that's part of the intrigued with this story Carol and you know Mr ... more of a reported on defense issues and have served briefly in the armed forces I Believe was aware of of some of these discussions then went and worked internally\nI Know he wouldn't have been at the cabinet meetings what we're driving at his word or any discussions involving a Mr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet with respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they'd heard from interested parties all of this deserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nVice admiral Norman is represented by Murray hand them very very good defense lawyer with ... for success or is it possible that this political interference doing is just a pie in the defense lawyer ... down in the ... case against declined\nThere is no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when\nThings are left in the hands of defense counsel the trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel by not providing documents that are central to the case if the trust that was breached in this case is the trust and confidence around decisions are cabinet sorry you have\nTo release those documents to see if indeed trust or minutes or cabinet memos were leaked the government can't have it both ways they basically ran\nA very respected senior officer out of the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up for his reputation he wants to return to duty if the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the charges were dropped because it's a farce\nI Will be in there we will be following this story and this new tool
