your data\nAnd the agreements today I think are pretty clear that at least for twenty three me that you know once they do something with that data\nIn this case you know partner with a pharmaceutical

to judge the red eye [noise]\n\nOttawa today the minister of public safety announced that he is ending solitary confinement in federal prisons Roger Goodell is making that move in response to it\nSmith and then there's the bc judge who ruled earlier this year that keeping prisoners locked up alone for twenty two hours or more a day is a violation of their constitutional rights\nUnder the legislation introduced today inmates will be presented with what is being called the opportunity to leave their cells for four hours each day reporters asked whether that is just a solitary confinement by another name here's what minister Goodell had to say\nIt is not a it is a fundamentally different approach would you go to the to the definition\nOf what young nations would call administrative segregation or solitary confinement it's of those two hours that are the key threshold when you're able to provide more than that as we're going to be doing under this new system with the proper kinds of interventions this will lead to the accomplishment of two objectives\nKeeping the institutions and the people in those institutions including the style\nSafe and secure but at the same time being able to continue the programming that will have the impact of contributing to the long term rehabilitation of prisoners so the key question\nIs are they going to be released in a condition\nWhere they have some prospect\nA leading a law abiding life\nOr are you just going to leave them in a condition where they will undoubtedly re offend again and there'll be more victims and there'll be less safe community was\nRough Goodell minister of public safety speaking to reporters in on a walk earlier today [noise] Catherine Latimer is the executive director of the John Howard society which has been challenging the constitutionality of solitary confinement in court we reach ms Latimer notable\nThere's an item and we just heard minister Goodell he says this is the end of solitary confinement in federal Canadian prisons what do you think\nOh you know I really hope minister Goodell is correct in terms of this being a significantly different regime than what we had seen under administrative segregation but I have my doubts I have my doubts about how this will be put into place\nHe says that the key to making this not the same thing is the amount of time that the inmate will be able to be outside of that confinement and so\nUh the two hours is considered by the United nations to be\nA not enough and that that's the key threshold that had to get past and that so that they're doubling that so four hours it would be the amount of time that they would be be able to be out of their cells and so able to get the mental health services and the other services they need what you make of that\nWhat does that do to either the rogue agent as a theory or the botched interrogation theory\nIt makes it all a charade it it it makes it makes what we've seen\nYou know everyone who looks at this has an understanding of what likely occurred it doesn't matter if you're a Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Bob Corker Senator Marco Rubio all Republicans all think democracy Yogi was murdered but yet again the one single person not coming to that conclusion as the president the United states Donald Trump\nTo come to the point where it doesn't matter that ... we we know they're lying there saying these things you know it's not too and it doesn't matter that deadline doesn't matter we're just going to at some point to that that don't accept that this is what is going to give you the truth even though everyone knows it's not and\nAnd Donald Trump and the the crown prince and the king just hope the world loses interest\nI think that as a gamble that they may be taking and I think would be a mistake on their part um I think it's very hard to imagine that Mohammed bin some on will\nEver get an interview with any other global mainstream journalist and this not be the anchor of that interview where they start you know our own my own magazine the Atlantic Jeff Goldberg writer in chief at a very wide ranging interview with ... and saw him on when he visited the United states in Washington\nA recently I Can't imagine him ever having that opportunity again without being directly\nAh challenged about um ah what Saudis ah allegedly did a against Jamal crush of having this part of it and and that's that's the future that that they're going to have if they think that they can you know try to exhaust the world with this and turn away and act as if nothing had happened\nJust finally because democracy ... was your friend to sit and said that he suspected he lives in this kind of danger\n[noise] Jamal could show the I've known him for a very long time\nI Can't speak for him now of course any more I don't think he ever conveyed that he thought it was life was in danger story that we don't know we don't see is that there is grief inside Saudi Arabia there is frustration inside the royal court there's anger\nAround Mohammed bin so I'm On that he puts them in this position because they actually like an admired and respected ... much of what Jamal was doing even as he was criticizing um their government on occasion but I think Jim all\nNew and had reached a point where he felt the pressure points were so severe um I never had a talk with him about whether he felt unsafe\nBut I think he realized he needed to take begin taking precautions\nHave I leave it there is Steve and of course will be following the story I appreciate you talking to

of the candidates culture and community and have been from coast to coast for Thirty years so I feel that it's a win for for me and for the candidates culture and people who are involved with

on billions of dollars in foreign debt the value of the Icelandic krona plummeted the stock market took a deep dive\nAnd almost every business went bankrupt\nIceland's courts doggedly pursue those responsible for the crash and last week marked the final prosecution of a former bank CEO\nAnd one of those caught up in the prosecution's was Iceland's former prime minister Gary Hart as it happens spoke with miss a Honda in September of twenty ten after Iceland's parliament had recommended criminal charges against him Carol asked him how he felt about that\nI think they are politically motivated and I think some of my old political opponents are secular political scores by criminalizing the political process and I think that's a very sad development\nThat's going to show was about but I said that are in the show to the restaurant the politics of course the banking crisis was a very serious matter\nI think no one is more aware of that on my show but the research for the crisis we're not a\nPolitical they were largely mistakes made in the system itself Barkley a sharp of outside developments but it was a set of complicated a complicated set of issues than September October to have it we have is that if a crisis\nBut you know longer in politics so what's to be gained by people in parliament voting in in to see you taken before this this court\nWill face a very good question I ask myself the same question it's a criminal charge up has been brought against me what are the charges\nSeveral different kinds of of negative ... but I have not been crushed to come up in a criminal investigation my point of view have not been brought forward\nYou are looking at what's been called the largest collapsed banking collapse in economic history it happened on your watch how should you be held to account for that well\nI have accepted my political responsibility by leaving politics\nBut it was on your watch those banks accumulated external debt that was many times last year the gross domestic product of your country was in Maine and see that didn't happen overnight to acquire a billion euros guy\nAnd aligned it was completely in line with European roads clearly this was unwise something should have been done about it we all realize that by now\nBut I don't think we could ever worked at the financial crisis it had been brewing for a long time and the problem of course was left in the early months of ... and throughout the night none of us show this company and not cited member no we're political leaders show it either\nThat was Iceland's former prime

chews up a book launch event in London we return in Cardiff, Wales\nAlison I Know that uh to Mr ... children are at the book lunch yesterday what did they tell the crowd about what this book meant to them\nIt was a very emotional ... because of the ... last\nStephen Hawking earlier in the air so they talked to last about how he was greatly ... during the ... which we were given the opportunity to hear some of\nThe quotes from the book read out by Steven himself it was recorded before he passed away and it was an incredibly emotional thing to listen to especially for his children\nAnd for you how how how emotional was for you\nIt was I'm ... I'm not afraid to admit that I cry policy that way he was talking about the future\nSpecifically talking about the difficulties we face I'm In climate both political and environmental\nAnd I'm One of the things I Do is is that she was trying to reach out to people especially young audience says specially young girls and trying to inspire them to become scientists and I'm One of the parts that he read out during the ... launched it was played specifically said about inspiring the next generation\nAnd hopefully by doing so we can increase the chances of inspiring the new Weinstein whether she might be [laughter]\nI just best outcry and it just really hit me hard that one that's the greatest minds our time is just\nSo aware of the importance of science education but also does is she in science making show\nThat the ... the next discovery don't know whether whether next discovery is going to come from or who's going to discover it and the next Einstein could very well be a woman exactly exactly and she might be a small go at this point in time and we just need to buy I had to stop off off getting these questions\nLike the ones I don't sit in the book you know will can be achieved time travel Cal them we populate space and things like that we need\n... in in young children to be able to answer these huge questions of all time\nI Want to get to some of those questions in a moment and how he answers them in this book but just because it it is a posthumously published book does he actually finished with himself or or how did this come about or that this this book should actually exist\nSo the book is essentially a response to the response of his first book that brief history of time because you know his his first book was so well written and even as complex as\nThe physics of black holes and the big bang I'm it catches lot of people's interest in that full and because he was such a great mind in history", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
