come from La Crosse ice hockey program or in Cambridge minor hockey so this was there this is their first full taste of a full ice hockey\nIsrael eight year old boys seven or eight year old boys yes\nNow this day I understand from the kitchen or coach that he he wasn't even trying to score I mean he actually was inspecting his his boys to do things to reduce the school or what what was he doing what was the insects and\nI'm actually they were they had numerous break ways and their player would peel off into the corner\nAnd pass the buck up to their defense men and move the puck around the perimeter [noise] um and then by circumstance or us not being able to clear the ... zone uh it would end up in front of our net and what\nEight year old boys want to do is scores so they would literally give us an opportunity to clear the puck and the puck sitting on the goal I mean they would just happen to him\nAnd so how you boys responding to all of this\nThey were following we we don't put up a score differential bigger than six ever\nUm they understood they were being scored on a lot um but we kept their emotions in check and every time they went on the ice they just\nKept trying

other when they're this young\nThe imbalance has nothing to do with the two organizations I Would solely have to talk to the alliance hockey federation which is who we play under um as for the
