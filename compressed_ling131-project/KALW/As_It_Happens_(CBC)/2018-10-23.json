today these blades face away from the wind like a pin will you blow from behind the blades are angle so that as a spin around they're more in concert with the wind is not fighting it as much\nThat

thinking that they're ... committed a good cook by that they said they had been in dispute that and that these guys died and cut themselves with pieces I've no idea what was it\nThat housing will probably look more or less the same but the way we run it will be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profit that means we could offer lower rent and then those buildings still make revenue so then we can use that extra revenue to put it into social housing which would be kind of welfare rate housing\nWhich we also desperately need because the number of homeless center city has doubled since two thousand five\nOkay now you've also said you'll triple the empty home tax why do you think that will be effective well\nThe previous council did bring in a one percent tax on empty homes and we know it's starting to fill units that were just purely being speculated upon really empty condos essentially are they are starting to fill up now is as the owners try to ah\nYou know avoid the tax but we want to accelerate this as well and actually we're finding now that some speculators are selling their condos to folks that want to live in them so the the taxes are proving effective and tripling it will ah just amplifies that affect them is\nNow the race was really very tight\nUh your main rival can send has not even concede and assuming he doesn't request a a recount he'll be presiding over not just a divided council but a divided city I mean how how are you going to push forward with these housing policies without consensus on council or or in the city more broadly\nWell or as an MP for seven years I actually managed to kind of the unsinkable as I got to measure passed through the house of commons even though it was opposed by the sitting majority Harper government which was to bring electronic petitioning to Canada\nSo I have experience working across the aisle other is this kind of joke that I was the most popular and pee and all parties but my own because I Would work so often across the aisle so I'm very familiar with how to do that uh\nYou know I was ah I I wrote a book with Michael Chong last year a who's a conservative MP and that was awful arrested a\nWith a lizard with me trying to stop the Kendra Morgan pipeline so I have worked across party lines often as an empty and I know I can do that in city council have already had some great

year your predecessor Gregor Robertson called for the decriminalization of some drugs for safe supply that is making available clean drugs that aren't paying ten\nWhat will you do to address the opioid epidemic well I Know Gregor was on the right path\nAt least under the Harper regime that was all responsive to specific requests from the city\nSo I think I've said that I Would strike and emergency task force with a health care professionals and first line responders to give us immediate steps that we can take\nAnd then it's my job to help go and get that implemented so that would be to for example talk to the federal government about getting specific exemptions from the criminal code to talk to the provincial government about some specific health care funding and to really focus on what I've been advised is the best step forward is this a substitution programs\nAnd new ways of uh distributing these substitute drugs\nHave just one last question a voter turnout was thirty nine percent that one down some last election what are you going to do to make people feel like it's actually worth shelling out to vote\nWhile we have the worst electoral system in the world here it's called an at large system it was an import from the United states are no other city major city in Canada uses it a and in fact it's been struck down as discriminatory based on race in in ... dozens and dozens of US cities\nSo I've said that this will be the last time we uh we used this type of system you can't believe the ballot it's literally it falls off the edge of the table that so long because everybody is included on it we don't have award system like you'd have in Toronto or or Montreal\nAnd so we have to change this for ... for the electric to understand what's going on I think there are as\nClose to two hundred names on the ballot that without really much information to vote who to vote for so this does have an impact on participation and uh we have to change it it was an area specialty fair me as an academic at Simon Fraser university so this is what I'll be working with the province to get the changes here\nOkay Mr Stewart ... thanks very much and good luck thank you

I was groped in the back of the car there were two other people there\nUm and the other two were not anything I had remembered one was another groping which had happened at a at a dance and the other was um he had said he had kind of\nA close the door and a bathroom while we were in their together and would not let me out until I kissed him which he said I did\nSo I wrote him back and said you know I I don't remember these things I Believe you\nBut I don't remember them and I felt it was really important each and kind of ironic if you think about it that I felt I needed to say to him I Believe you\nKnow in the course of the me too movement which is just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologize after being public ... and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed or in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um and this really did hit me with the fact that she did not have to do this I mean he could have\nAnd I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for dinner tonight you know and\nAnd he could have been quite confident that I Would move on with my life as I have for the past Thirty years and not you know really talk about it anymore and he didn't have to fess up and also the kind of\nTone and content of his apology was\nWas exceptional it was complete vulnerability he did not say you know I did this thing but I and I I was just a kid or I didn't know any better or that's just how it was back then he said\nI did these things he lifted them very very clearly he said I\nAbout this in the intervening years I've always wanted to reach out to you and apologize and he just said I'm Sorry yeah\nWell and obviously he there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about this is you don't say whether or not you accepted his apology\nThat the the the last line in in in your call and and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology at you you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget\n'em why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept it I Do accept it and I think that's a big\nWay forward in terms of the me too movement I don't think of when they need to\n... on and off the hook for their actions and I I don't believe that however I think there is a lot of there's a lot of power that women have in freeing men who are able to come to the point that this man was able to county\nWhich is to say to recognize the wrong to address the wrong be making making apologizing okay I think is a really powerful thing\nLeslie thank you so much for talking with me today\nThanks for having a moon show\nWe reached Leslie low in Halifax is low is a columnist with the health effects Arab\nIt was one small step for a marathon man and a big leap for the Canadian men's record time\nWhen camel Evans crossed the finish line at the Toronto waterfront marathon yesterday\nHe not only completed his first marathon he smashed or record that had been on the books for forty three years Mr Eleven's time two hours nine minutes twenty five seconds was forty four seconds faster than the Canadian men's previous record it to our ten minutes nine seconds\nWhich Mr lemons sat incidentally after recovering from a serious foot injury this morning camel Evans spoke with Matt Galloway hosts the metro morning CBC Toronto about the record performance\nAh I'm I'm a little bit for sure especially uh just the early turnaround are leaving this morning but I'm looking forward to that of a break here and I'm sure I'll feel great after\nGoing into this race this is your first marathon you had had a great career before this point but a marathon is completely different um what were your expectations\nI knew I was a very fit and I thought\nIf things went well like it a good time maybe get close to that record but it's like you said the marathon is based and they're just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being my first one is very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from running shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of this the athlete's foot by softening the five getting picky on the track but for me I had a very serious surgery on my\nUm I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track and so it was just sort of a natural fit but I could do a little workouts that the marathon required a little bit easier it was just easier on my body as a result I just ah really took to the training and\nAs a continued on I I Love the corporation and I'm ... now\nIn that recovery me as you mentioned serious injury um do you run for a long period of time were you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all\nI don't think I ever faced that but I think that was very serious concern with the surgery I mean you can never do you want to come back from something serious like that back\nCan't be an option but I I had serious boats at different points in my recovery vote whether you wanted to continue to do this you know it's very hard road to come back from\nThis records drone drains record stood for forty three years and people have gotten close to the records they've almost beating the record and then because of the marathon and the fact that it's a long race and anything can happen some things have happened in it's falling apart at what point in the race yesterday did you start to think seriously that you might have it in your science\nThe reality is I didn't know exactly how close I was into probably the last few kilometers and I knew with an absolute certainty that I had it with the five hundred meters less but up to that point it was\nAnything could happen I can completely blow it so but yeah by that
