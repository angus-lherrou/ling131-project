would be I\n... people have been warned so we can start at the beginning why did you call the central cabinet minister Lawrence the collie and\nI was ...\nWe had our Raleigh their boats house or the bad deal that or the federal government was set up for the Jerry on the farmers a hundred of this land to both of thoughts on the power and focus sounds and it's not like farmers here the pickup focus

the ... model is one thought well some farmers persuaded launched to stay on the ship a lesson to be kids bonds was not happy eventually Lawrence we leave or last urban without without my voice has a tendency to carry for some reason\nI Lawrence earlier about the mayor elect him and I said you're a\nLarge just like that or was it a bit louder than that far\nBut like my voice carries a lot of them not to say it loud he heard\nOn the road he looked at me he looked shower but I'm absolutely falling let the federal muster that he's letting the federal government like Gary down this road it's a deal with the devil and we don't like it\nOkay to some people know the deal the devil you speaking as is the U.S and see a which is if the trade deal distinct between Canada and the United states and Mexico right\nThat's right they have given away a huge piece of our industry for forty years my cell phone ... dairy farmers are worked for lots of built equity I've never taken any money or the from I've always thought about English from\nThey've given all of our games away and we are in la ...\n... so the kids you are referring to these are the next generation of farmers who will inherit these dairy farms and you wanted they want to say what it meant that they did this deal how this deal is going to affect them right\nAbsolutely on law and still don't want to stay for it\nSo he was made to stay and um he was getting quite cranky at the end of it goes one young mother in particular rip came to him and told them don't sign this deal in large watch Lafayette er and said I'm going to sign this deal\nSo well I was being a bit of a problem and not while he was leaving a lot of like oh they're more like a book about five seconds after I did that a farmer behind me said you can't you know we don't do name Carlo sockeye goes on and we're on he was right I decided I had to apologize to do that\nBut just before we get to your apologies that I mean ...\nI Know that that's it well I hang on

crutch month crutches normal I used to work but um oh yeah it's it's a it's a slight the column up in ... and he was quite sour about it and I really did owe them on an apology and I gave you a heartfelt apology\nWhy did you decide to issue this apology to the ministers who a letter to the editor\nAll politicians read the letters to the editor\nAnd what do you own your way through apology

said he should tender his resignation and come home to ... and then you said please don't be remembered as the jerk that destroyed the dairy industry\nSo now you told me he's going to be a jerk if he doesn't resign\nAll all all of them I don't want to be remembered as a joke I didn't actually call him a jerk\nBut so if he doesn't do what you say you should do which is ... resigned and come home

his office told as it happens he read that letter and accept Mr McFarland apology [laughter]\nThey have some self awareness ability and that's interesting when we're thinking about\nMaybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nSo you didn't have those one in five young to know the other war but also there they were they're aware that there is a test and so they're probably being more reflective ... on their nice date\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in that study about driving and and and the use of cannabis is so again I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can\nIf they can be targeted to sensitized uh the public and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nGiven your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that that bought the ... messages that if you are under the influence of candidates if you smoke or inhaling you shouldn't be driving and you should wait a long enough period of time before Dr resuming you're driving in our case even after five hours\nA their capacity were still impaired so uh you need to uh wait to significant amount of time before taking the wheel again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and then you I Know you were interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do some more studies like this\nI there are many said they needed but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a older I'm drivers who are using a candidates for medicinal reason\nA daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and I don't know that we can extrapolate our results to these other groups where the impact or the influence of Kennedy's me have different defect\nAll right well very very interesting information during this historical week so we are in the mid ...\n[noise] that was professor Isabel ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in Montreal [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... long is struggling to sell something that once seemed like a no brainer Mr ... is Justin Trudeau is minister of inter governmental affairs he took on the job this summer as what was once widespread support for liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode and the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of its commitment to combating climate change but Ontario Manitoba ... and the odds are all now oppose we reached enter governmental affairs minister Dominic ... in Ottawa\nMinister though you had a broad prevention support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious and they were on side now you have ... would be premieres lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\nBut so Carol from our perspective um we have been consistent with Canadians are on with our international and global partners to Canada must take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that and twenty Fifteen\nAs you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which spoke about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute or climate change plan\nAnd we have to all Canadians and we've told internationally international community that Canada was going to take robust as serious action\nAnd so we're continuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay\nTo go back to what you just said because you said that they're they're taking a different tack you have ... years of the premium Ontario or they want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be there premier who are not just opposing you taking a different tack they are campaigning\nBy fighting the carbon tax they are putting out rallies come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds for their campaigns on the backs of saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of push back you have a full scale wind coming toward you\nSo again if some conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens wouldn't be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country but if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally does not have\nThe challenges of climate change we're telling Canadians we do and and provincial premier skin organized\nRallies if they want and say what they want it those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing forward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real\nWe saw like heroin New Brunswick with the historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit auto and gotten a few weeks ago so Canadians noticed Israel and they expect their government to take coherent and concerted action\nThan we have said that we will we are prepared to do that in the case of provinces that decide not to be partners we have a federal plan including a price on pollution which will come into effect on January first\nAnd we will then be in a position to give the money back to Canadians in those jurisdictions where we apply to federal plan because provincial leaders have decided not to take their obligations seriously\nI guess I'm asking is that yes it some of these ... are\nActually campaigning on fighting the carbon tax or calling it the job killing taxes you know and they're being successful doing that is it entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or is it the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed to make it clear to Canadians why you think it's necessary\nSo again that the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner\nIn third place he used to accuse the liberals have having all these job killing tax secret plans and Canadians took us from from third place to first place\nWith a majority government and implementing a price on pollution and coming up with a robust serious plan\nThat deals with the real challenge of climate change is that commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces territories across the country just because one or two or three find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't\nCross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just a few news is that you've got for clean is against you you've got Ontario there's got to on prince Edward island plus now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago destined to do was celebrating him as the conservatives who gets it\nAnd then you've got Alberto ... he could take over next that's not just a few years more than half the Canadian population\nBut again I admit Jason Kenny has to be careful not to assume the job of premier until he wins it in elections\nHow Mr palace there\nAgain that would be a good question for Mr ... because if he decides to change his plan or where to draw plan that he had shared with us that included putting a price on pollution\nIf he decides to sort of flip flopper change his approach I don't think that mandatory buttons um who have seen first hand also the very real effects of climate change in previous years\nThere should or shouldn't necessarily think that that constitutes the best plan that we've talked a few minutes earlier about\nA price on pollution and making polluters pay is one of the most significant ineffective elements it's by no means the only element and we have in a climate plan with a number of provinces a whole series of other measures which are also part of reducing our emissions but I we were
