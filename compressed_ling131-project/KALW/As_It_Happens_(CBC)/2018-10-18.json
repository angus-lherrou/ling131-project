[noise]\nEach year marketplace partners up with polling from Edison research to African Americans a few questions how the economy doing are you worried about a downturn is the government handling the economy well things like that\nThis year though the poll included a new question asking people how much influence they thought tech companies had on the economy\nAt us and found that Seventy eight percent of Americans believe big tech companies like Amazon apple or Google have a good amount or great deal of influence on the economy\nWhat's surprising is that fewer Americans more like sixty eight percent of people think the president or Congress have that much influence over the economy here to break it down at me they're heroes and co founder and president of Edison research\nI remember a survey from the Nineteen nineties that that's the question who gets more credit for the good economy Bill Clinton or Bill Gates and Bill Gates one strongly um I think the American public definitely thinks the president has some influence on the economy definitely blames the president of the economy does badly\nBut I think there are savvy enough to understand that it's really these companies these entities you're outside of our government that makes our economy good or bad weather it's\nGo back to the auto companies of the early parts of the twenty century well through the twentieth century or any other sort of emerging kind of technology to change things ... et cetera and now for the last twenty five years it's been the tech companies\nIs the first time the Edison and marketplace have asked this question specifically right what prompted that as it related to the kind of the conversations we're having right now about the influence of these companies will not\nThings that affect the economy to get a sense for what people think is really responsible for what changes the economy ... people were very likely to say large financial institutions as well have an influence on the economy obviously people saw what happened\nDuring the global financial crisis about ten years ago and so they can see the influence of those kinds of companies have on the economy and in general they saw that all kinds of businesses have more influence than politicians are Congress or president or many other things that we looked at two\nAnd then obviously politics is very polarizing and divisive right now and yet the strong majority the Seventy eight percent who said tech companies and banks had a lot of influence across political age and gender lines what does that tell you is it are they unifying in a positive way\nWell I think it's important that we clarify that the fact that people say they have a lot of influence on the economy doesn't necessarily mean they think it's a good influence they just see that the influence lose their and yeah this was absolutely one of the few areas in our poll where there's almost no difference between Republicans and Democrats in the way they see these things\nSo I think it's just a generalized awareness of what really does drive our economy and it seems to be big companies\nThat Larry Rosen cofounder and president of Edison research you can find other takeaways from the Edison poll about trade our economic anxiety index and the bull by the numbers on our website marketplace dot org\nI'm only what and that's marketplace sec\nHello I'm Carol a\nGood evening I'm Jeff Douglas this is as it happens\nTonight addressing a chronic problem now that pot is legal the feds say they'll also make it easier for

Canada\nJust checking for many Canadians today marijuana legalization has simply been water cooler talk for others it was an historic event outside of licensed marijuana shops across the country here's how Canadians reacted\nMy main goal was to be the first one [noise] buying\nMean like it's a it's like Christmas and New Year's and all in one\nDay so it's a big day for me how I wanted the variety 'cause it's gonna be a lot of different kinds of different smells in Turkey and all the different strains so it's a good idea to cut\nWhile you're really looking for\nI think it's like a big deal it's like a moment and it's like [noise]\nIt's like a crack in like the like puritanical ideals of like\nBall now that I can purchase it legally my money will go to the government set of going somewhere else or for another nefarious purpose right\nAs some voices from across Canada today which is a people purchasing legal marijuana for the first time\nFor others today is bittersweet\nAccording to a group called ... amnesty there are half a million Canadians who have convictions related to marijuana charges on today in the federal government announced that it would be pardoning knows who's carry simple possession convictions\nBut that does not go far enough for and BP member of parliament Matthew ... who address prime minister Justin Trudeau during question period today\nBy taking action to legalize and my stating clearly that he believes that the war on drugs fail and recognizing a historic injustice way it's been pointed out so clearly\nIs worried fish and the fact that we see vulnerable Canadians racialized is indigenous people\nMore disproportionately affected by that so I asked the question again Mr Speaker will they yesterday will favor explained to me\nReally and there's discrimination\nMarginalized some racialized communities across the country we're\nThat will be free\nIn order to make sure\nFollow a decent proportionately marginalized people

reached him in Toronto\nMr personality to think that less than twenty four hours ago marijuana was illegal in Canada and now it's not what do you make of that\nI mean a a good step in the right direction it get\nFrom that needed to happen quite some time now I don't think it's the final step that we need to take I think there's a lot more that we can do to address what we consider drugs and drug addiction and how we ... them and how we police people that use drug for recreation or on the other\nTo believe the faculty is when they say they are not targeting innocent civilians in Yemen\nThese arms sales you referring to in Canada is part of that we are selling armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia\nBut at the same time we heard a Donald Trump say well that is as bad as it is what happened to to denounce showed me a are we really going to jeopardize a hundred billion dollars in trade ... much of that with arms\nTo add to complain to to protest the death of one man\nWell that is exactly why we shouldn't just be focusing on one man although it is important to use the tragedy of anyone's death ah to talk about the wider issues and is it important to say the city's not to protest for one man to to protest for the\nThousands of people innocent people who have died because if you are in which case providing the um avid planes providing the navigation providing the servicing of those planes\nUh the reality is the teacher's not supplying just these big ticket weapons eighties person and the allies NATO allies particularly conducting this war and we have to take responsibility for that\nYou think though that did Great Britain or will learn take a lesson from what happened to Canada as you know\nOur foreign affairs minister recently even before the case of a general ... she complained about the treatment of human rights abuses going on in Saudi Arabia and Canada received very severe diplomatic sanctions from Saudi Arabia is a huge\n... we didn't get much support from other countries as well and you mentioned that dust up do you think that that may stand as a lesson to other countries that might stand up to Saudi Arabia\nWell I Hope that it shows that we were cowardly and not supporting a commonwealth ally in Canada and we\nShould actually follow suit a there is always a danger if you don't stand up then you find you a next on the firing ... and yes there will be some\nTough words and some of it sent back to go forward either way but it's all I Would prefer to see a country's\nStanding up for it to dry and having a combat pay all their eggs bold than um find we have unwittingly supported the ethnic cleansing of a particular group of people in the Yemen do\nYou think that the war in Yemen will ever be the focus of our criticism of ...\nFor lots of people have asked to fight it out of mind and the Yemen is an incredibly complex and difficult comfortably that means that uh um is it easier for people to forget about it\nDo you think though that it's easier to wrap your head around our heads around the violent deaths of one man then to contemplate an impending famine is they're now saying is the case in Yemen and Thirteen million people\nIt it's always the case isn't that the the the two um rally around the example of one\nLove one thousand I'm ... and as I say it is the ability of politicians\nAnd journalists to to expose the example is about the pattern of behavior of an aggressive or violent state\nThat has been a hotbed of many of the MEK snuff the ideology is that we see it in a world today and that full it must be a wakeup call to stop 'em a conflict and cooperation with um with the dangerous regime\nIs there a similar they proceed speaking with you thank you thank you very much\nLloyd Russell ... is a

I gave you both\nNames yes now how about the the other one is what\nAces teams are THC okay\nAnd how do you sound sold your product yet\nUnfortunately I haven't because I've just come back from

that uh it was exacerbated by doing vertical ... stairs in Portugal [laughter]\nAre you a regular user you just trying to support your son's business\nMy regular user and um have been for fifty years not not not starting after breakfast or anything like that\nBut at the end of the day at the end of the work day usually before supper I Would I Would have a joint and or maybe a ... show before going

it's it it it's just a relief whereas before I Would be very circumspect and only talk to my friends who I knew\nAnd uh but now it makes it all the different sort of the world because\nAnybody who says to me ... this that well you know it's two thousand and eight gain this should have all been done fifty years ago when the true do you know they should have said I'm going to legalize cannabis watch may\nOkay well and you had you actually have a story about how he had to do the father the man who actually now has legalized that that\nIs correct ... went and worked and worked for him diligently at no charge to organize the largest political capital trade ever held in the province of land and I'll tell you one of the key organizers was Mr rex Murphy\nUnderstand part of this story takes place in the woods\nSo that was in a place called carbon there and it was at a hotel and they went first stroll with the security people you know behind Trudeau\nWho's that initial ... rex Murphy and here today\nAnd fear and whether rex let down is a good and tell you about that I have\nHow consequential you research is is that scientists who have we do or responding to what you published are\nIn shock that this is around the world and extremely disturbing a research report did you has released and and ... and we've seen this everywhere we're seeing declines in all kinds of\nAnimals and and parts of the food chain why is it so much more significant in spite of Puerto Rico\nWell that's a great question yeah I'd like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHad been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years\nThat's thought to be primarily a fungus and affection but the consequences I think are so somewhat unexpected\nOf our study in that if it's replicated and we'd need more data keep telling everyone that but it's true on these are complex systems we just did a little kid a rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico in the tropical dry forests Andres and I studied before\nThat a similar declines insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has profound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico then that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future\nOf by a diversity and the preservation of systems um I think it was unexpected it's a it's a rather unknown effect in tropical rain forest\nBecause people don't measure insects and I'm like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted it's the tropics they're warm they're doing fine maybe logging um in some cases no pesticides would have an effect\nBut not this kind of extreme collapse\nAnd so why why why do you think is happening in ... yes well ten years ago actually colleagues\nThat tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive to increases in temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because you'd think oh wait a second they evolve and how's it going to affect it by a couple of degrees of funny\nBut they showed it probably is a very narrow range thermal tolerance\nFor that was their predictions born out many laboratory experience but Andres I went down to Puerto Rico to the first truly happening in the tropical rainforests and as far as we can tell the story chewy predict should have been born out\nBad and it's just devastating do have this News I'm glad you went there and ... back this research and I appreciate you towns thank you thank you so much take here\n... lister is a biologist with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute we reached him in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts\n\nHe made a bid for some freedom was swiftly reject it Paul Bernardo had a parole hearing today the convicted murderer and rapist has been in prison since Nineteen Ninety five\nThe mothers of Leslie my happy and Kristin French to have Mr Bernardo victims red impact statements that the hearing a third woman who was raped by Mr Bernardo and survived read a statement as well\nMr Bernardo spoke on his own behalf he admitted he had quote hurt a lot of people but claimed that he no longer poses a threat to the parole board disagreed Mr Bernardo will remain behind bars\nTim dancing the lawyer who represents them happy and the French is spoke to reporters after the hearing\nEven before today um and it isn't the victim impact statement on O'Donnell referred to it specifically in her victim impact statements that there's never been an apology by ... never any indication whatsoever of remorse and uh\nYou know I think some self pity that we saw today and there was nothing that we saw a ...\nYou know reached out to the family to say I'm Sorry and that he's remorseful when he talked about was he knows that what he did was wrong and it was terrible but that's something different than reaching out to the families and and apologizing to them directly\nMr dancing was also asked for his impressions of Mr Bernardo statement before the parole board\nI thought that he was exhibit age to be Frank I'm\nHis explanations about justification\nAnd his self esteem I don't think that he had an appreciation\nThat he wasn't helping himself\nUm but as I said and I mean this sincerely I thought the parole board\nWere was very well prepared and and and and had really done their research and understood the file and asked important questions to bring out a some of his responses so you know we really do applaud the parole board for that [noise] um [noise]\nSomeone like Paul Bernardo talks about well what what my ... my trigger is is a is low self esteem\nLet me just take that by itself in light of his his history\nThere isn't an expert in the world of psychiatry and psychology that wouldn't tell you that\nHis explanations where we're proof positive that he represented a very serious threat to public safety and even more so for the board as they did do reaffirmed the dangerous offender designation which is ...\nDangerous so\nI don't think he did himself pretty good\nTim dance and his lawyer for the families of Leslie my coffee and Christian French Paul Bernard has been for parole was rejected today he's been in prison for twenty five years\nMm\n\nThey are a Canadian mine rescue team called the diamond in the Bronx and they just made history the diamonds are the first

that's the opportunity to raise awareness on diversity equation with a specific focus on emergency response which has been a dream of mine for eleven and a half years so it was a lifetime\nAnd how to others in Russia at this competition how did they react to seeing an all female team of mine rescuers\nIt was it ... it was positive all around from the time we arrived in were introduced at the opening ceremonies we receive nothing but a warm welcome we received standing ovations anytime we went up on stage during our final like a relay race we\nReceived a standing ovation and can't pay chairs from the crowd yelling Canada a diamond ... than it was just\nAmazing I've never felt such a warm welcome anywhere so it was it was overwhelming and diamonds are there are that's the name of your team yet but I mean when the team and also the name of the nonprofit that money\nBut in Russia as you know this is a country where it's actually illegal for women to work in underground mines\nYeah it is and our team was the first women to perform and work on the underground workings of a mining operations in Russia\nWhat does the men say about that\n[noise] well you haven't received any negative feedback so far it's been positive with the other competitors it was nothing but positive reaction there with a few competitors that actually came to us and told us when you were that\nThey were so impressed with us that they were going home to their daughters that they could do anything to\nDo so and the competition itself what did you actually have to do describes some of the events in this competition\nThere were seven events total one living underground formulation where you go underground and you're actually perform work to address the problem or whether it's
