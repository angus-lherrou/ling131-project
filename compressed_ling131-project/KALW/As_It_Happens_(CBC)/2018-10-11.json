innovation that was built on this technology right whether it is social networking or gaming or video a lot of those companies that built their products on top of this infrastructure or American companies so the U.S was kind of a hub\nFor this you know giant economic boost for the country and that is why so many countries I mean you have the European Union\nIsn't this tens of billions and then of course there's China\nWhich has invested more than any of these competitors as far as the infrastructure so the assumption is if you're first to kind of build this ten lane superhighway in the sky that you know if you feel that they're going to come right that these companies and these innovators are going to come to your country\nYeah what are people saying about the challenges of rolling out this infrastructure\nOne of the great big challenges that comes over and over with five gee is how expensive it is to build the network on one reason is because of the nature of the frequency where these signals are going to be transmitted is the cells are going to have to be really close together so every little physical piece of infrastructure is going to have to be much closer together\nThan it is now and they don't have to be this big giant cell phone towers the nature of the technology is you know could be a small little pizza box sized thing on top of a light pole but all those have to be installed you have to negotiate with the city or the owner of a house\nTo be able to put up there so one of the price tax that one of the consulting firm said was you know on the

another will be out on the market\nYou know what's the broader timeline well you know a lot of folks in the industry talk about a five year rollout and even more broadly that each of the past generations of wireless technology three G. for each of those generations has been about a decade so maybe that kind of order of magnitude\nGot hung up the marketplace reporter and our former China

this happen and you know it's like a nightmare um\nHow did this happened so quickly\nWell how did it happen how would how are they are no warnings what what are you hearing\nWell it was a thunderstorm last friday and south of the Yucatan and then Saturday morning it was a tropical storm\nAnd I was not that concern at that point but I have a number of boat captains that became very concerned and they said this is one that we need to watch\nAnd by Sunday Morning it was almost panic bill with everybody I was talking to\nI started to pack up things to take just in case the house will be there

love lost between the the Turkish administration and the Saudi royal family so can we really trust the Turks are saying I mean don't don't they don't they have an out against the Saudi royal family\nThere is a kind of a ... minutes between the two governments but there's also kind of friends with both sides have been careful to maintain cordial relations\nThere both important regional players and I think they both feel a need to continue to get along and really is quite inconvenient for the Turks that for president on\nTo have that rupture now because Saudi is a it's a pretty big trading partner and the economy's in trouble already so there's not much incentive for him to be picking a fight\nWe know in Canada what it is to take on Miami had been some on and has had quite a desktop with him it was in fact Mr ... he wrote about that\nBut why doesn't the rest of the world responded dismissing the U.S patent Donald Trump saying he's concerned that Mr ... hopes his all all

but it every day gets less and less likely and it's really hard for me to believe that the Saudis are keeping 'em someplace locked up and it doesn't make a lot of sense that he's kind of a runaway a

opportunities the country is very diverse and like all over the last ten years or more kind of of the immigration system where they welcome new immigrants so those are some other\nReasons why I

do it like um that that part of a shock to me by surprise on\nYou know I didn't know it was\nI didn't know that we're going to lead Zach right I thought it would just like stunned but then they asked us to leave about what it was fine\nBecause by the time we were there for the than fifty minutes so um before we actually went into it they actually did all this safety procedure to check on all those stuff so they check to ensure that everything is secure secured so I think that kind of up just to get a lot more comfortable\nAgain and I mean people who do the citizenship those I've not done it and I know people who have it's quite a memorable day the advanced yet [laughter] so you didn't have to do much to make it a special lines for you why did you agreed to be one of these people\nWere

revealed that and then she asked me if I I'm an adventurous person so so I said yes then she asked me if I've ever done a bunch of jumping I told her no she asked me if I Would do it till they're not
