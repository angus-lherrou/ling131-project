{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "And because I knew it I could see things out there in the campaign that other people would just go right by I mean we're in there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the tweet shows the Jewish symbol over images of Hillary Clinton and dollar bills [laughter] the message over the star says most corrupt candidate ever\nA lot of people said wait a minute that the Jewish star this must be an anti Semitic reference\nMega debate boils down to whether or not you think a six sided star looks more like a star of David or a sheriff's badge\nThan they should know don't be silly that the sheriff star ... but because I was trolling around looking\nAt the images on these alt right websites I knew exactly where they had gotten that it wasn't some innocent thing they didn't stumble into what they went looking for that image and somehow thought that was a good thing to send out [noise]\nAnd then the final campaign that candidate Trump ran his closing statements or the twenty sixteen presidential campaign [noise]\nWe found\nPolitical establishment with a new government controlled by the American\nDark dark ad that spoke of global special interests coming after America\nFor those who controls the levers of power\nAnd for the global nationally they partner with these people\nAnd as they ran these words global special interests you saw the Jewish faith is of Janet Yellen the Federal Reserve chairman of Lloyd Blankfein the chairman of Goldman Sachs and of George Soros the Jewish philanthropist mhm three Jewish images\nComing on top of those words global special interest it was just hard to mistake\nAnd we will take back this review\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\n\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were called on it by reporters always said you were seeing things that aren't there\nThat's right and remember the plausible deniability always came from the terrorists men that is a bunker Trump\nNow so you think the president does not like using a prejudiced against you think about the president of the United states you bet and you know ... and ... you know why they hate us\nDonald Trump has a Jewish daughter Ivanka he has a son in law who was an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren and the Jewish ... how do we understand what you're describing is kind of unmistakable appeals to anti Semitism in an ad like this being president in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters\nHe and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included racist that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to accused him of racism or anti Semitism but I Will say that when confronted with the darker side of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely about an electoral calculation by the president by those around him\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste or lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of awakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it often felt a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that change\n[noise]\nIt was ... it was a white nationalist rally that seems like it was about race\nBut suddenly you had all these young white man [noise] marching in unison and chanting\n\n\n\nShoes will not replace [noise] and I remember being truly confused by that chance like why are white nationalist talking about ... it did not make a whole lot then\nIt made a lot of them [noise] why\nBecause there is kind of a him the on of evil in the old writes in this new breed of\nNeo Nazis and in that pantheon the watch word is white genocide that they believe that the white race is being supplanted replaced watered down\nAnd they also believe that the white rate is superior to Latinos to blacks to anyone who is not white right and remembered Jews in their mind or not white\nBut they look around them and they say well wait a minute if we're the superior race how could it be that these brown skinned black skinned people are succeeding in white genocide are replacing up and that's where they look for the\nPuppet master and they find the Jews the Jews in the alt right world\nAre the ones who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orchestra raiders of white genocide are Jews that's why Jews will not replace us\n[noise] so what's the connection why are Jews now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians Mexicans et cetera\nFrom member of the stranger for you or a stranger in the land of Egypt\nIt is actually part of the religion to welcome strangers to welcome immigrants are welcome refugees and actually American Jews really created the concept of repairing the world to tune alone\nAnd this kind of welcoming response to the stranger extended to the Nineteen fifties to African Americans who were then\nStoring the civil rights movement [noise]\n[laughter]\nI Love the rabbi all the Jewish community but later on down the regime\nThat most important things that are done in my life\nThat bigotry\nOn the most urgent problem\nEdging\nDisgraceful\nShame for the most tragic problem is\nFiling the civil rights movement was a seminal moment for Jewish and black alliances\n\nAnd yeah and that has tremendous resonance to Jews and two of fighters in civil rights and it also has tremendous resonance for the alt right who always the Jews somewhere\nIn the background orchestrating their demise\nWhat's kind of complicated about this discussion is that I was so prepared to have you told me that\nAll these troops you heard about were factually falls but what's really tricky about this conversation\nAnd hard to grapple with is that Jews in America have done the things I welcoming outsiders that they're being accused of\nDoing by these white nationalist [noise]\nIn ways that completely ... filed a simple ... heat but what white nationalist believe is that these things are describing are being done not out of altruism not out of a kind of scared of generosity but to undermine white people they see it as something being taken away rather than something being given\nExactly it all fits into the alt right world of white genocide\n[noise]\nWe'll be right back to\nThe daily is supported by home adviser matching homeowners was home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major
