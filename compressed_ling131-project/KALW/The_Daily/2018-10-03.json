{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "You know a number of people said to me was the one at the keg he was a guy standing by the keg\nDoing what drinking a lot and\nActually what was interesting to me was that you know one source said to me that Brett\nWant it to be the guy who got the girls and he wasn't the guy who got the girls so he tended to drink a lot and to some extent use disrespectful language when talking about women but no one could remember anyone he had dated so there was this kind of an interesting picture of sort of a wannabe\nMan about campus who actually really was known for holding up the walls that was a phrase that I heard a few times and what does that mean and that means the guy who was so drunk he needs to stand along the wall because if he came away from the wall he might fall and so that was known for holding up the walls [laughter] [noise]\nAnd I caught a nominee Brett Kavanaugh outbreaks of silence for the first time\nFor me I found that right after Brett Kavanaugh appeared on Fox with his wife and portrayed himself as something of a choir boy\nI was focused on trying to be number one in my class\nOn the top to the ... are\nDoing my service projects going in church of the vast majority\nInformation started to shake out in a more overt way where people were sort of proactively calling me and saying wait a minute that's not the bread I knew\nOf them went so far as to say you know you can't lie or way onto the Supreme Court um and what did they think\nWas the lie you know basically that ... was whitewashing his past\nWhat ever a time that you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened then I for no\nCause I never have never set in ...\nKnow that he was portraying version of a young person that they did not recognize and they felt was disingenuous and that that went to the level of character\nAnd it spoke to someone's integrity and truthfulness and they thought it was important information for them to share they may not have stepped forward otherwise but this was a bright line he crossed\nSo then came to hear [noise]\nFor the ... before the movie will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but for for ...\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment as I'm dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at that time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about we're not on what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us went to dance with her she hung out with us is uh\nYou can out of context a media circus that there's been generated by this thought in reported that referred to sex or to not\nThe people I was talking to who knew him at the time cried BS on it they said\nBrett Kavanaugh spoke about her disrespect least so did his friends it was not at all if he's presenting it and that's just a lie in terms of the drinking\nA drink beer with my friends\nJudge Kavanaugh presented himself as someone who liked beer\nI still like beer sometimes I had too many years\nSo did other people and then tried to turn the table on other people in other topics\nI liked it better for that I like beer I don't know if you're trying to like the center and um what do you watch the ... one is or what are you what I Would have you\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happens\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know of you\nTo you if that's not happened\nIs that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have\nI have no drinking problem in order to walk\nThe alumni I was talking to say no ... was a very heavy drinker and by the way so where we are all he was not necessarily exceptional in heavy drinking at least at Georgetown Prep but falling down drunk stumbling downstairs vomiting all of these behaviors that we associate with excessive drinking that are at issue here\nHappened to him and happened to a lot of us and he's not being honest about that either he was never the choir boy he's presenting himself to be never never never that was a text message that I got from somebody and the idea was that I as a reporter need to help sort this out because the public is being misled [noise]\n\nThe daily is supported by home advisor

the testimony that prompted so many ...\nAfter the hearing what was interesting was the gloves came off\nOne of his ... classmates says the person he portrayed himself to be today does not match the person she knew at Yale room\nAnd you suddenly saw up some of the people who had been reluctant to speak to me in the first place on national television\nI don't buy it I I Am I in fact not Brad I knew as soon as I met him in college it's not the bread I sighed during four years at Yale\nTalking about Brett as a drink or who would get incoherent\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Wylie yeah he was a big party are often drank the access and there had to be a number of night where he does not remember\nI had one of my sources say to me anyone who says that he wasn't rip roaring drunk isn't telling the truth\nAnd I would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said um I drank to access in high school I drank access in college I did some stupid things um but it now but I never sexually assaulted anybody but he'll lie under oath to lie about that\nThan what else is true can be ... you know and the highest position and the judiciary and our Lance and not the difference between truth and lies that that's just terrible it\nThey just kind of let loose in a whole new way\nWhat was also interesting was that whole sense of loyalty to him and those who are still protecting him\nWhile also was eroded where the suddenly became a little bit of a come to Jesus moment where people realize they had to choose sides and if that meant losing friends it was worth it the stakes were too high and they were going to come down on the side of truth\n... and who are some of the people who came forward\nA most noteworthy was one of my classmates named Chad loving ten he was the class of eighty seven he was a basketball player a very big guy\nHe said he had a statement he was going to give it to me Monday today he ended up giving it to me last night and it was pretty powerful statement went to the thing he talks about how he was formerly reluctant to speak\nBut he didn't necessarily think Brits alcohol use in college had relevance but\nThat now after hearing him on Fox and hearing him testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary committee he became quote deeply troubled by what has been a blade mischaracterization buy bread himself as drinking at Yale and quote and how does he described\nThe drinking you saw he goes on to say that especially in their first two years of college when he often drank with Brett quote on many occasions I heard Brett slurring his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was here when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nOn one of the last occasions I purposely socialize with Brett\nI witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark not by just using the situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail
