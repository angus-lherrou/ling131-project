{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Have come forward and tried to reach the [noise]\nTo describe this behavior that they see as at odds with that [noise]\nWe drank beer and\n\nYeah so so did I say the vast majority of of people our age at the time but in any of that one drink beer and\nAnd are still do so whatever yeah\nEspecially when it comes to the string\nSaid they weren't quite sure how to reach the FBI and we're having trouble actually getting a hold of people at the FBI so it seems like knowing whether the FBI has connected with them and bothered to talk to them\nWould be telling\nIn knowing just how much the FBI is incorporating this question of truthfulness\nAssassination [noise]\nRight and I think we may not know until the reopen background check is officially completed and we see what the scope is that they've done\nAs of now there is definitely evidence that suggests that a lot of the people who are wanting to come forward are struggling to feel like they're heard some of them are being told to simply file reports an online Web portal which seems\nOne person described to me as sticking a needle back in the haystack that that whenever they're going to say isn't actually going to get to the right people in other cases there had been names that have been given directly to FBI agents directly involved in this inquiry and yet the people whose names have been given have not yet been\nCalled by the FBI and so\nWe don't know for sure whether there was a directive by the FBI to specifically focused on his honesty and whether or not he misled or lied or mischaracterized himself during that testimony however keep in mind\nAll of this is intertwined all of this is related questions about his drinking could potentially affect how you decide whether or not he was truthful and denying the sexual misconduct right if a senator concludes hey he wasn't truthful about his drinking so therefore I don't believe his denials on the sexual misconduct\nYou could also see a situation in which a senator might say look I Believe his denials about the sexual misconduct I don't think he\nTempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed himself in the dorm room but I also think that when he back before us for several hours in the Senate Judiciary committee and downplayed his drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and and I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the Senate committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I don't think he should be on the court because regardless of whether I think he committed sexual misconduct you want somebody on the court who's honest and I don't believe that that's that's the kind of thought process that a senator could go through\nSo this is not about getting a definitive answer about whether\nJudge Kavanaugh salted Dr Fauci Ford or\nWe'll be making that to terminate the FBI is not going to conclude what the FBI is going to do is summaries of the interviews for\nThese noon at the FBI is the three oh two next interview for them of all of these people will be ultimately delivered to the senators who will then be able to read them and\nUse the information as more grist in what they are going to ultimately have to do which is either yes or no on his nomination to the Supreme Court\nSo senators will have access to the FBI and you see these three oh two forms will\nEver get to see them [noise] [noise] well that's a good question and we don't know the answer to that normally the answer is no the FBI three oh two forms are not something that normally becomes public Senator McConnell the leader of the Republicans have said he doesn't expect them to become public\nUh we'll get an F ...\nIt'll be made available to each senator\nAnd all the senators\nWill be allowed to look at it that's the way the reports are always handle\nHowever ... this is a remarkable moment and a unique moment and there are senators on both sides who have said I Hope\nThat they will make the report public Judiciary Committee member Corning spoke of making the findings public\nIn spring will be satisfied until some public statement about what the official from a background investigation shows they can't\nImagine that it wouldn't become public for the public has a sense of what did the FBI find from talking to people\nMike thanks very much sure happy to be on the show any\nEarlier today with the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh completed\nThe Judiciary Committee allowed senators to review an angle copy of its report Republicans and Democrats were given alternating hour long time to examine the document\nDemocratic senators called the report incomplete and insufficient\nIt looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps by the White House I don't know\nWon't Republicans and errors that the report offered no corroborating evidence to any allegations made against\nThe senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check out what their requests it and I am ready to that we'll be right
