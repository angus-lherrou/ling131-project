the American people\nAnd new devised a contract with America which I worked with him on quite a bit\nTo help give people something to talk about\nEvery item in our contract you supported by sixty percent or more of the American people this is a contract with Americans for America\nBut the main dynamic was sitting President Clinton had done a number of things that aggravated the conservative base\nTonight I Want to report to you on the progress we've made a made turned out to vote for Newt\nSaw that that was going to give us seats that we had never been able to win before\nDo you remember specifically what things Clinton was doing that was riling up the ...\nWe asked the well off just pay their fair share\nUm first of all he raised taxes and that was a bad thing\nIf you send the legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away you will force me to take this pen detail the legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over again then of course the failed attempt\nTo pass Clinton care which was probably the biggest negative issue and then there were some social issues\nI Believe that American citizens who wants to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies him from doing so\nGays in the military and things like I think that we today couldn't imagine we're really controversial even but back then they were\nRight and then after down town I remember gay marriage being a pretty prominent issue\nThis is not prejudice legislation the defense of Marriage Act is not mean spirited ... it is a preemptive measures to make sure that a handful of judges and a single state cannot impose and agenda up on the entire nation\nAnd another one that I remember one so called partial birth abortion yeah and I'm curious how much thought went into focusing on that specific issues because they certainly didn't seem arbitrary\nYeah well you're not wrong first of all the central social issue really was and in my judgment is abortion mhm in the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the ... right to life movement United around the notion of amending the constitution to ban abortion\nPeople figured out a couple of things first of all that there was not going to be political support for amending the constitution and second of all of their wasn't political support for banning abortion but right fly much still was quite United\nAround trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be a ...\nBill Clinton you know ran for office saying where abortion is safe abortion should be stable illegal\nLegal but rare\nHe felt the need to use the word rare because he understood people were an easy about abortion even though they did not want to ban so binding away to try to restrict some abortions without banning abortion across the board resulted in\nThe focus on late term abortions which most people oppose that most people bought by the way were illegal\nThe term partial birth abortion means the person performing abortions partially that generally delivers a living feeders before killing the fetus and completing the delivery\nNamed partial birth abortion did not exist until someone who wanted to ban and abortion procedure is made up this erroneous and inflammatory term when it came to these particular late term abortions\nWhat seems to me either very clever\nDefinitely cynical depending on your point of view\nWas that it forced Democrats to articulate a position on abortion and its most extreme\nYeah I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't that's not the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back in the Nineteen eighties and the Reagan Democrats essentially were southerners that used to be Democrats and blue collar northerners mainly Catholics that used to be Democrats crossed over and they voted\nFor Reagan well in both cases there were Democrats that were at odds with the liberal consensus on these social and cultural issues we've been talking about\nYou take a democratic politician and you'd put them in a very difficult position if you force them to come front and center on some of those issues because it created a wedge between their liberal base if you want to use that term\nThe more traditional\nConservative cultural voters so to force Democrats to confront those issues\nYou know was a winner for the Republicans no question about it you know it's funny one of those\nEarly memories I have back then was\nSeen Patty Murray\nIs very liberal Democrat\nFrom Washington state yeah I'm I'm trying to remember her son his his editor who was voted in during the year of the women and I think she was an avatar progressive promise and suddenly the Senate was voting on the defense of Marriage Act\nShe like the majority\nOf Democrats was voting to ban gay marriage and I remember coming off the Senate floor and being surrounded by a scrum of local reporters and she looked pretty miserable defending her position\nYeah the ... well the Democrats were definitely tortured over those issues and a lot of them change their position to conform\nA more liberal cultural view and that accelerated the movement of cultural conservatives into the Republican Party there were no longer\nRonald Reagan Democrats or Bush Democrats [noise] they were Republican\nHow do you think the strategy has aged\nWow that's a good question I I think that yeah I I think that there are some issues where it's\nContinued to work but I think that there are some problems\nThe Republican space long term\nOf the changes in the culture the most obvious I think and it's a place where I think Republicans are changing as on\nOn the L. D. V. T. Q. issues but I think\nThat those issues\nI I don't know if I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would simply liked to say that\nThey present a challenge to Republicans\nWith stay to the benefit of President Trump and\nSo you were anticipating where my mind was moving wishes that certainly hit slated to thousands for gay marriage seemed to be working and the Republicans favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more of them favor of gay marriage not\nAnd many older Republicans are keeping mount about this issue I keep thinking about how John Kades during the debates you know gave this response when asked about gay marriage where he just\nBasically said that his God told them to love everyone I I think I think that the gay issue\nIs\nA little different than some of the other cultural issues\nOne of the things that's happened is that everybody today knows\nThat was not always the case\nReally gets people kept it hidden\nAnd an awful lot\nThe Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a logical issue or a theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do you think that they were on the wrong side of history\nI mean on that one I Would say\nThen more broadly do you think that maybe other wedge issues are short sighted\nMean because that was one of them\nWell I don't I don't want to broaden by response on that you know I don't want to say that's true of cultural conservatism generally\nI I Would not extrapolate\nWondering [noise]\nIn\nIn\nThe daily uh supported by homemade visor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals full a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major models homeowners can read reviews of local pros added book appointments online at home at ... dot com\nAnd by fracture creating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass a fracture is an image frame andme out all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more attracted me dot com slash daily\nCorruption scandal and greed in college basketball we talk with Michael ... about what he calls the buying and selling of basketball players some as young as eleven it involves sports apparel companies scouts coaches parents\nFinancial ... something years and billions of dollars his new book is the last temptation if we're the teen oh China [noise]\nFresh air coming your way of six o'clock this evening ten minutes from now in Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco [noise] good agent matches buyers and sellers with top performing real estate agents they donate part of the commission or into a nonprofit of your choosing", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
