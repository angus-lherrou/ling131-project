{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "That's a bad moment for her because\nOf the state is overwhelmingly Republican\nNew coming out from Fox News shows Heidi Heitkamp Republican challenger up ... points that's quite a lead\nAnd they were supportive of farming judge Kavanaugh support\nFor judge Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court is strong in North Dakota\nThirty four percent of likely voters in North Dakota that they would be less likely to vote for Heidi Heitkamp since she'd be a no vote I haven't I mean\nSo that was a tough stretch for\nHer and it was not on stuff that she wanted to stop\nSo given this pressure that the Kavanaugh nomination\nPuts on her does senator I Can't\nChange her strategy yeah\nOne of the most important jobs than any US Senator is to fully vet and considering nominees to serve on the United States Supreme court\nFor silver hiking was forced to ... a month\nTo address questions that she did not want to address\nToday judge Kavanaugh and I had a thorough and have a discussion about the importance of the rule of law precedent ethical standards that the U.S Supreme Court reaching more consensus on the court and avoiding activism from the bench so I think all those things will help the court shielded from politics\nYou first just on the general issue of his\nConfirmation I learned more about his judicial record and temperament which will also hopefully become clearer during the Senate hearing in the Senate Judiciary committee next month and then\nAfter these allegations came out to be more sensitive topic of his\nConduct and is past\nNorth Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp saying she quote supports Senator Jeff flake call for a non partisan FBI investigation into the allegations about judge Kavanaugh quote which I've been pressing for we need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job keep in mind\nShe's recorded Neil Gorsuch to the court last year she was one of three Democrats for the Senate who did so\nSo when this pick was first made there was some ball that should be open to confirming capital\n... but she wants\nDesperately not to have to say [laughter]\nThat's correct okay so tell us about the lead up to senator I Can't vote on the nomination\nSure so ... did not say what she was going to do on a vote for weeks and weeks after he was nominated even after the allegations\nIn North Dakota democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp is still undecided on Kavanaugh machine as quickly losing support of women and now she's running twelve points behind her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer and if I Can't votes against Kavanaugh twice as many say they would be less likely to vote for her\nIt was not until about forty eight hours before the first spoke last week\nPaul de local TV station that she will know I'm Brett Kavanaugh but she said that she would oppose so Scott\nHi everyone wanted you to hear directly for me about why I'm voting against confirmation of judge Kaplan\nMy understanding is that what finally spurred her opposition at least that's how she felt\nIn addition to the concerns about his past conduct last Thursday's hearing call into question for me to judge Kavanaugh's current temperament his honesty and its impartiality these are critical trade any nominee to serve on highest court in our country and\nShe was very disturbed by judge Kavanaugh's conduct that the here and in particular that exchange that Kavanaugh had with similar culprits are from Minnesota where the judge kind of snap back at them at a club which are at stake heavy whacked out they canceled it bothered by that she didn't like that conduct\nShe's a former state attorney generals and she sort of has spent some time in a courtroom and she I think in her mind that was not the kind of temperament as she wanted to see on the high court\nDr Ford um gave a heartfelt credible and persuasive testimony it took a great deal of courage and also came at great personal cost her her\nPolitically there was always the pressure on her ... or cap on and I think it would have been more daring to of opposed to before the allegations lifting once the allegations came out that put her in a tough spot to support his confirmation\nThat much of my life in public service focused on combating domestic violence and protecting women and children from the deans\nActions right now are an important signal to young girls and women across the country\nShe hasn't had a lot of your her career dealing with issues related to sexual assault and you know she may be losing so significantly did\nHer vote wouldn't matter so if you're going to have a ... you may as well vote your conscience now than I obviously and she very much thinks that she's still a game but there's no question that she trail like an ...\nSo let's talk about what you've been seeing on the ground there in North Dakota yeah in a couple of days since senator high camp made this decision take us through your trip there\nSo I got the Bismarck on friday and the state cap on the middle of North Dakota\nAnd then Saturday I wanted to breakfast places in Bismarck and talked to voters the first one was kind of a traditional diner or you know a lot of folks they're having their scrambled eggs and\nMore conservative place and obviously there was a lot of support there for capital\nYou talked to one fellow there who\nIs very fond of hiking but there's no fan of Kramer all\nAnd he said he thought that Kramer would always all and he was honest or hiking them bought political he thought that she had basically see our fate by opposing capital replace him when he was more of a kind of a lot ... place and I talked to one table for women\nGenerally Democrats or Republicans\nBrio before we're probably Kramer voters and one was a high camp or any kind of illustrated to me the challenge high campus but he's one of the voters also no fan of Kevin Cramer said that she talking about that but once I came out against capital\nThat was not prompt her to make a grudging vote for Kramer\nRent a reason is because of abortion rights because this person strong Catholic anti abortion and just could not stomach the fact that her senator opposed the confirmation of\nThis judge at the same time enough lady at a table it was a I Can't vote around like a Democrat said that she would've been upset of Hi Kim hadn't have opposed capital\nWhen I deal with in every way around\n\nAnd so that's the kind of challenge that she was in you know in some ways are kind of you if you do damned if he does\nWhen it comes to voters\nIn North Dakota Jonathan what do you think that this ultimately\nWill come down to this is the challenge hiking in past politics has got\nMore polarized as we all do but it's also got on national and local issues and regional questions\nAre increasingly less relevant in the federal races like Senate races to more straightforward question up are you on the red team or the blue team and there's no question that it is a conservative state and that's what we her biggest challenge is to hang out what can still vote for her at a Democrat used to be a lot easier it harder now\nSo in other words try as a candidate\nMight to keep things\nSpecific and local\nThey may have no choice\nOf course you've got to pick one side of the other\nAnd you know in the past\nDemocrats more conservative parts of the country and the Republicans the more liberal parts of the country for those lie to rely on incumbency to rely on the politics of personality you have to have a wedding charming persona that could really help\nThose things matter less now because politics is to one more nationalized and whether it's Republican you know in a liberal state or a Democrat in the conservative state it's not as easy to sort of create your own brand and oh boy\nThe perceptions and assumptions about National Guard\nSo who's Kevin Hi it's almost like\nThe candidates are having to choose\nNot just am I a Democrat or Republican but am I with Dr Ford or am I with\nYes there is no question about that that forward on Capitol happy stand in for the red to blue and if you support for that you're you know your team blue if you work out my you're on the red and again that is the last\nSort of issue that high can't wanted to face here in the closing weeks of this campaign\nShe wanted to keep this raise more local\nWe'll be right back\nThe daily it's supported by Baird employee owned and independent
