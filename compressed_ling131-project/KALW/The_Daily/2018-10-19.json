what's your record ... the the hosts the similar you know uh\nI'm actually really excited there's no need for an introduction you know this guy asked me if you don't really see K everybody [noise]\nLadies German you know the guy from his show on\nPlease make welcome Lewis the case I'm like you know there was no fanfare [noise]\nAnd\nYou know how the audience responded yeah they cheered [noise]\n\nYou know any of the examples of a joke he tried out during his performance yet that parades about tipping waitresses it was just that we're not very startling mhm in the way that\nThis will be constructed in the media and correct me if I'm wrong he he does a familiar routine he does the set that is classic decay\nHe mentions whistles and one of the things he mentions is a joke about a rape whistle so it sounds like classic Louis the gate despite the fact that those kinds of jokes have a different entirely different residents and we I don't mean she was tuned in says that the joke was about his daughter said some that you know that not all\nWhistle for clean what about the expression clean as a whistle\nAnd so we started talking about different with all this kind of with all that whistle rape whistle that don't feel clean and that led wasn't a rape joke by any means ... it's not like there was a performance that did not address what I Would regard as the elephant in the room they didn't address at\n\nNightline\nComedian Louis the caves are private parents had a comedy club just months after admitting to allegations of sexual misconduct\nThere were no women were one\nNight enough buyers do not have the right thing to do that anymore and the era of the me too movement why some day soon [noise]\nWhen did you realize that this was going to be a a big deal\nLike a lot of hate mail I got threats of violence really I mean what was the content of those kinds of threats when they were going to fire bombed the club things like\nA scary can I ask you know as this criticism is coming in\nAre you identifying what you like meaningful criticisms and push back yeah and and and what are they yes so some of the people\nFelt ambushed mhm you know you can imagine you wait all week to go out to a comedy club on Saturday Night and ... and you walk into something which really really upsets you when you're angry at the place for doing that so what I've done to answer that is that we have a very clear policy centuries says swim at your own risk we\nDon't know who's going to pop in ... if somebody\nIf you check on the house we don't want to upset you so nobody can say there were a captive audience which would infuriate me to other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work yeah he's like\nNever mhm might never he says never\nI said well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never\nThis is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the harvest place what you would say particularly to a female customer who was\nSomebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton was credibly obviously accused in Juanita brought her I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\nNobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were for years why were they giving standing ovation ... that are after accused of sexually abusing the he was ... he did it\nBut behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton president Lewis became a comedian is someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you know if I'm had nobody cares\nThat Mike Tyson who raped or convicted of raping somebody performs looking only controlled the venue you control yes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistency in the world and when you see wildly inconsistent demands if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of\nWomen and expose itself and women should never work again\nBut it sounds like you're saying why should I Know I'm the owner of comedy cellar knew something out of the normal way of warning an audience\nWhy should I be from now when I'm warning you know and I said that but even though I Will do that do not expect people to the warning people outside of el plans it that's what I'm saying I don't want my customers upset that the overlay this entire moral structure on it\nAnd they presented I just don't you understand how the world works ... and I look around at the was the last you know that's not the way\nThe world works in the world very much picks and chooses so I have two ways to handle that I can either get involved in that and found this person can perform this person you can reform and explain to them well how come you let norm go on and you ... you know I'm going to become a hypocrite overnight mhm or\nI told the audience is and this is the comedy cellar it's unfiltered and\nWe don't want you here not understanding that it's not the end of the world to see somebody that you don't like or that you ... you know but if it is in the world for some people it may be based on their promise in their own life are the things they know it's just too difficult\nSo then this is not the place for them to come or you can come and just leave mhm no questions asked

Minnesota state legislature\n[noise]\nInflection point tomorrow at twelve new non KLW San Francisco\nA few weeks ago I sat down with the owner of the comedy cellar\nAs you've been thinking about this what conclusions have you come to about who in our society gets to decide when someone\nCan come back after and these kinds of allegations and these kinds of admissions it said is that the audience is it the comedian Louis ck a is it is it you the gatekeeper using your own or the person who says yes or no yeah we'll get so you know I I might be on the wrong side of this because I can remember years ago\nWith Mel Gibson subtle those things about Jews and all that I always felt\nThey don't need to stop him from making movies you know I I take that issue seriously too and I'm a grown I can go see a movie or not\nI I felt even then this is going to go in a bad direction because there's always a a movement in one direction or the one guy gets boycotted then people start looking relative who's next\nAnd then the standard foods boycotted begins to diminish and then of course there can be very um inconsistent standards of who's boycotted so\nYes the answer I think would be that you should have the right to change the channel I do hear you\nPutting the responsibility for all this\nAnd others in a sense the audience and it still feels like a very powerful decision as a person who controls the venue\nTo death because say this person can come back maybe maybe it sounds like you're just three they asked\nTwitter to filter tweets all the time and they want people that are so the question in my mind is okay so Roseanne Barr had that awful racist tweets yup", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
