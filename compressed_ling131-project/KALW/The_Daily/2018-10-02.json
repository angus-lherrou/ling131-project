I'm not even getting a discussion about that right now fair enough and then what [noise]\nPoint Senator Flake gets up from his seat and walked behind the day is behind the other senators that are talking any taps Chris Coons the senator from Delaware democratic senator from Delaware taps on the shoulder and indicates that he wanted to talk to him they walk through a pair of double doors behind\nThe committee die us and they go private we back behind into an anti regime is behind a committee chambers people watching on\nTelevision the other senators are noticing this but\nDon't quite know what is going on behind closed doors here's what was happening\nSenator Flake and senator coming to our friends they've known each other a long time they trust each other they're the kind of friends in the Senate that are more genuine it's not just uh my friend on the other side of the aisle Senator Flake says to senator ... I'm having second thoughts\nI think your idea about a week delay to give the FBI time might actually be possible but I'm nervous she says\nAnd so what follows is absolutely\nA remarkable scene where suddenly this conversation between these two men becomes much larger senator Coons goes out and get some of his Democratic colleagues come in and continue the conversation behind closed doors\nSenator Tom to list of North Carolina Senator John Cornyn of Texas to Republicans they also come in over the next forty five minutes or so you have virtually every member of the committee\nBack in this small cramped hallway behind the committee room and what's happening is Senator Flake is essentially standing\nPretty much silence according to the people who describe the scene\nAs he's surrounded on both sides by these two warring political factions so the Republicans on the committee senator tell us and Senator Cornyn are arguing strenuously you can do this this would be terrible at only ... the judge's wife even more Chris Coons and the Democrats are\nTrying to cope him along saying look you know this is what the Senate it's about it's about compromise it's about finding a way forward without\nJamming something through for political purposes it got very heated as it was described to us and all of it with Senator Flake coming even more anxious was he going to reverse themselves and they actually put the brakes on what had seen\nJust moments before to be a foregone conclusion um we'll be right back\nThe daily it's supported by penguin Random House audio dedicated to producing top

into the golden age of tone and they may have\nCalled it a wasteland and then I can be very different than TV makers tell vulgar more complex more philosophical story binge watching an on demand viewing of change the way we see those stories from Breaking Bad to his room without the philosophers and others among them of our news on the go\nTo the golden age of television do their noon on kale them Ninety One point seven\n[noise] like Cher how does decide to move forward\nSo at one point he raises the concern of is this something that the FBI could even do is this something that would be valuable to the FBI do they have the resources to have the wherewithal so somebody suggests calling Christopher Wray the FBI Director ... they tried that they can't find Christopher Wray they can't reach him\nAnd so the second choice is to call Rod Rosenstein how it comes down to you know a phone call\nWith the very man who the press and might yet fire and was actively considering firing that the phone call that obviously needs to be done with some privacy so Chris Coons and Jeff Flake\nCrammed themselves into one of these old fashioned kind of oversized phone booth closed the door took out a cell phone and essentially put it on speaker and called Rosenstein we're told that Mr Rosenstein does reassure Senator Flake that the FBI can do an investigation though he does say\nThat given the scope of it relatively short amount of time less than a week but it's unlikely to produce a lot more than senators already know but he says yes we can do that\nSo with this green light from Rosenstein what Senator Flake do Senator Flake there's one last thing before he comes back into the hearing room and that is that he takes this phone and he calls two of his Republican colleagues who are not\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary committee and that is Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska he called the two of them and basically said\nAre you guys with me both assured Senator Flake that yes they would back him and that they would demand the same thing a one week delay and an FBI investigation armed with that Senator Flake way back into the committee room\nKnowing that the Senate Republicans and President Trump would have to relent because if they didn't\nThey wouldn't have the votes ultimately to confirm judge Kavanaugh without the three Republicans [noise]\n\nAs a point of personal privilege I'm going to call on Senator Flake\nJust fake uh\nNormally we would start to vote right now but as a point of personal privilege drivers call on Senator Flake\nIt's interesting it all happened very quickly and even for a veteran watchers of the legislative sausage making process it was it was quite messy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
