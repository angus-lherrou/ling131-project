I usually\nAnd I sit and they got home my mom started like why are you home silly and I'm like this is what happened to me she said you shouldn't have been too late and after that kind of just stopped talking about it\n\n\n\nSo I Want to shift focus your two\nTwo pretty sensitive question especially given what we just heard\nOne of the conversations surrounding these accusations against\nBrett Kavanaugh is that this was high school\nSo how much we should\nCarry given that context and I'm curious what you think as high schoolers\nShould what you do now should what anyone in high school does now follow you around\nFor the rest of your life yeah yeah because I feel like like obviously I was like a rite of passage and you've got to make\nMistakes and learn your way through it but there are certain things that it's just\nLike like say hateful things\nTo certain minority group than things like sexual\nConduct that kinda stuff follows the victim forever if follow the victims for every well then you've got to do with it too says it's your fault you know what I mean\nWhen you're sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year in high school you have a moral compass that will tell you what is right and what's wrong so\nIf you're already in the state of ... were you know what's right and what's wrong I mean you are consciously making a decision to do something wrong or you are cautious making a decision do some ... which is the same thing is going to be feeling the rest of your life [noise]\nI Wonder what you think the message was when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed many of you have talked about the experiences they happen to you or to people you know\nThat we're a salt and given the fact that he was accused of that and he was put on to the nation's highest court what's the message to you\nFor all we know it could have never happened but the fact just so the fact that he was accused shows that anybody can get away with anything as long as they have enough power\nThat like people that um that are watching him might think oh if he got away with that I tend to because if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring needs to like a trial like I'm I'm going to be good because look who is now our Supreme Court justice he got away with it so why not mean to me\nIt's kind of just feels like a bagel out really care about your situation type of things from like the higher up than the government and stuff it felt like we don't care if you like it or not you have to take it and like it feels like they don't care about our opinion or safety is the fact that we're even here\nEven though we make up like a big\nPercentage of people and it feels like they're kind of just like well that\n\nI really want to thank you all this has been really
