{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "As a high school student I did not feel like my peers and I are learning everything we need to be\nAn active participant in democracy many students feel that things like more robots to political science classes and education around climate and social justice issues are necessary how might you address this pardon\nMy you know my daughter went to Harvey Milk 'em and\nHad a really big social justice bend to it as you can tell 'em and that coupled with her parents um activism a made her kind of like super activist for a long time and\nAcross the entire school system it would be wonderful if we could bring social justice and political science and all those lower classes\nI have political science and high school I had a I had a political science class in high school and I had\nI have a best time ever in it I Would love to have that happen\nAcross the district um and it would be amazing if we can bring it and really bring it to everybody across the district not just Fifteen schools um so that's really where I Would really love to see that happen\nAnd I have I have\nI have lots of plans for this I think that we could bring a lot of really good education to parents and students and everyone involved in the school district if we really really work\nTogether as an entire district not just one or two schools [noise]\nThank you [noise] ... question for you [noise]\nThere is no standardization or central a website for school tours where shadow opportunities and this seems inequitable what would you suggest or how would you improve access to a school site visits and information\n\nAnd so there isn't a separate website uh but there are different pages for each school and they're not sufficient they don't have all the just super practical information that working families need to have when they're making school choice so\nI'm so one thing I Would do is improved a site so that there was perhaps a video that can help people get a sense of the field for the school also\nPractical information about the rich enrichment programs that are available at each school and basic information about before and after care and what the cost of that is because those are the fundamental things that we need to know\nA language accessibility on each page is important\nBut more than that as some people referenced before I think we really need to invest in building and romance and retaining students and it's more than a website it's taking it to the streets it's you know when I go to Sunday streets with my two boys\nI see charter schools and they see private schools have tense and we should be going into communities and really telling that successful exciting stories about our schools to get them curious about a Roman\n[noise] thank you so much um [noise] I mean yeah next question for you and there have been a couple of\nQuestions about this so I'm In a sort of combine them into the um some of the public middle schools in some ... private middle schools\nHave an off in a way a policy for cell phones during school hours um a lot of questions out there about cell phone use in schools especially middle schools um so what kind of policy would you support\nA for middle school specifically regarding the implementation of of cell phones during the school day\nSo I is that the salt tears and students hot recently at a ... middle school and mission high school and I would say from the lens on being at mission that\nWe need to have a consistent and strict ourselves on policy\nNow there are times that in the science classroom for example you might actually use her phone for timers as timers\nBut those are those are monitored we have so much on monitored use and it's really easy you know in in any school setting for kids to kind of slipping under their tables and for where I could sit at various parts in the classroom I I could observe that the teachers and the Paris cannot always catch that\nWe need to have like a shoe pocket or something you have some way so we\nI'm In often\nThank you belong to ask you the same question what what are your thoughts about cell phone policies and specifically in middle schools um but if you have thoughts just in general for the district\nSo I'm Muslims in middle school and we had to get them a new phone and he didn't her for a week\nA week we had the most conversations over I was his best friend and I was like I should just not even get this could have phone anymore\nUm but it's a problem of therapists right and I really do think you're going to see a movie or some you know something around a technology and disorders\nOr especially around us cell phones are now we're for mobile crisis and we've gotten calls from parents who have been attacked by their kids we're talking with their cellphones right so it's an issue right some issue has become a mental health issue as well right\nAnd so we do need a stricter policies around or what is healthy use of cell phones and not only do our kids need to be educated about it but parents do to write him a in a slow to our school stuff [noise]\nUm how are we going to do we have to come together collectively and figure out ways to do it with the professionals we may have to drop in the field and see what\nThey may be able to suggest ah but I Do think it's an issue and we do need addressing\nThank you next question from Michelle I'm not going to have you go last again [laughter] sorry [laughter] um let's uh Michelle and mia M.\nVaping has become a huge issue um in schools whether it's high schools or or even middle schools um what are your thoughts about a prevention efforts to reduce\nThe use of a\nTobacco products and and other devices like that\nOh boy [noise] um [noise] well let's see there's I think a couple of things and\nWe need to have robots discussions about this in our high school health um classes which I Know are to an extent happening I've had kids my kids have been in high school and I have heard about those discussions that we have to be starting earlier because we all know that that starting earlier so that needs to be happening in the earliest elementary school and and\nAnd actually a big part of this I think it's educating the parents and teachers because yeah I like no idea what vaping was like a year ago\nSo we um we need to make sure that parents and teachers understand what the risks are and how to identify that that might be happening on the other thing is um we have to you know I was a big supporter of ah you know against the big tobacco efforts that we've had\n'em here and so that they are not marketing to our young people and we have to all unite around causes like that\nOn so that there is there is less risk because we know that they also were targeting on disproportionately students of color and um and we have a responsibility to support and protect our young\nPeople thinking man\nThe sense of very important issue that you know\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago the tobacco industry was you know targeting young people in different ways I and now they're using how called vaping as\nUm and discouraging people from drinking water so um you know I worked as a structure a transitional edgy of San Francisco I worked with various community groups to I\nHave young people educate their peers on the harmful effects of the tobacco notches cigarettes but tobacco because uh we can see that when they're using things like you know cookies and cream flavored vaping it can be misleading and you don't know ah\nWhat you're getting into and then you you know have all these harmful house side effects so I think first of all I Would want to work with our wellness center is work with pure resources to really have youth designing their own ads to combat or be big budget ads\nUm and yeah I I think they have the answers\nThank you um I just got hit an update there was an an an additional questions from one of the sponsors um that has been added so I'm going to insert this one here and we'll have this be for a leader and Monica\nAnd it's from the um SF Educational Fund African American and Latino kids across our district or not doing well academically what is your plan to deal with this what ideas do you have around closing the achievement gap while keeping students at the center\nAll right ah I said Alina and Monica ... All right\nUm well this is exactly why I'm running I'm unfortunately I've seen first hand how um my children have different expectations I'm set by teachers then we're set 'em for me as a child growing up I'm not all\nI've also seen some great role models for my kids um\nI think a lot of it starts with getting more teachers of color into the classroom um\nWe've already talked about implicit bias I think that's a huge part of it building capacity and it's not just enough to send one person from school say off to a training about something as serious as implicit bias\nThe parents and students could kinda\nThey're uncertain at this point what the process was in identifying the you know how the school relocation was going to happen\nYou're listening to K. A. L. W. Ninety One point seven at San Francisco I'm K. A. L. W. education reporter Lee Romney this is a public forum that took place on Monday October Fifteen\nAt Ruth a sell off all of the art\nThat involves Thirteen of the Nineteen qualified candidates running for the three available the on the San Francisco Unified School district board of education\nFrancisco Chronicle education reporter Jill Tucker is the moderator you can find this entire recording at K. A. L. W. dot or that's also where you could find information about Nineteen candidates for the San Francisco Unified School district for\nNow let's return to the forum\nThank you so much um I like this question because it comes from a fourth grader so I Love kids when they ask questions I'm so let's go with Michelle and the question is um this is a a student who is very interested in math\nAnd she wants to know if there's going to be enough differentiation which he spoke correctly [noise]\nFor her to learn interesting math and and I think this goes to perhaps a little into the question of uh\nBringing algebra back to the eighth grade and and how to engage students um in math and how to differentiate math at all grades including fourth grade sums up student\nThank you for asking that question and I certainly hope so one of the one of the main tenants of of why I'm running as to making sure that we're meeting all students where they are and that we're providing the challenges and the opportunities for them that they need to be successful and if you are interested in math absolutely I Want to make sure you have all those opportunities\nAnd we do need to support our students to our teachers to be able to differentiate in their classrooms um I Do I think that what's really important is that we look at\nUm the way that we expand opportunities for all of our students is not by limiting opportunities and so we have students who are already took salary and middle school and in high school because they love math and they're ready and they want to go on and be\nEngineers and physicists and all kinds of things we need to make sure they have the access an opportunity to do that and when you start early you know in elementary school I Want to make sure we have girls math class and we have opportunities for college that they see themselves as math people because I Want to make sure that those advanced math courses in high school are reflective of our entire student body\nI Want to make sure that they all have access there and we have lots of math opportunities not just calculus but we're also putting in um data science data visualization and financial management and all of the rest\nThank you feel the same question from our fourth grader what would you do to make sure\nThat a student who is interested in math and fourth grade remains ... interested in math for the rest of her life\nUm so I absolutely agree with Michele I'm not that actually one of the subject areas in which I work with coaches a lot on the air and a different you should have heart rate like when you get an a curriculum out of the box and you as a teacher you just by how you're going to\nMake that curriculum come alive for ... is an incredibly challenging an awesome job of a teacher\nAnd they can't do it alone\nAnd uh we in our district a need to make sure that if students are ready to celebrate beyond what the teacher's able to provide in the classroom or we're not standing in the way of act how reaching those opportunities and that we need to make sure our course pathways the structural organization of our staffing alliance to adopt\n'em and now we provide not just the core schedule is starting in high school but in middle school as well um and so I Do think that I supported openly the re evaluation of our curriculum um and understand\nCommon Core but also that were being includes over the fact that students are coming up with different levels um\nAnd I will stop there\nThank you for the next question for Monica and phone got what curriculum subject is currently missing that shouldn't be taught in school that you would want to advocate for\nUm Monica so this is talk to a lot about parents is you know just preparing our students for life like financial literacy debt to being a good civil servant and being in\nAll these life skills that our kids are not being taught you know in our school so that when they graduate you know we have a huge percentage of kids are Eighteen you know getting into that and how to balance the budget how to have successful relationships consent that needs to be taught very early ... and so what [laughter]\nSo all of these things about relationships about finances about serving the engagement needs to be taught from elementary and you know from elementary school onto through twelfth grade and so really so that we are preparing kids not only to graduate but prepare them for life\nSo they can have successful relationships that they can be financially stable they can buy houses they can um you know have healthy relationships that are so that's something that I Am very passionate about and making sure that it's you know age appropriate and I remember going back to the question about suffering engagement I'm\nReally even with our elementary students talking about ah\nGetting their response is about political things that are happening now like for example like the whole you know families in cages and our kids being separated from their parents like so often are just so much better than we are and they can we buy those solutions that we might be too afraid to tackle matter which I was young [laughter]\nShe could go on for a long time on that one I could tell she ... up over\nAs my buddy ready for the question so K. through twelve ethnic studies for an hour and high school and introduce streamlined and always being from kindergarten is the first start\nI'm a member segregated from your Monica is on it as well as a school for me is more than ... mix right 'cause on there for six hours a week\nOr two about leadership it's about you know or other things that are I really feel like a I'm going to bring to the school district is really addressing real privilege umbrella toxicity and so we talked about this the sexual harassment and stuff going on but we don't really talk about\nThe root of some of this stuff and where it's coming from and I feel like you know what I'm saying that because one of the curriculum to answer the question is a mental health right or milk religion a little dog says he for me it really was a metro because you are the needs to be addressed a within our school districts and um\nI started a pool or prevent program or burn I was going to address the concerns within this country with the with the amount of young women that were being raped in high schools or the country and it still exists today and so but I think that needs to be expanded the roads are district\nBecky thank you\nThe next question is for Allison and Martin please um there's a a a significant teacher shortage and in across California across the country really\nUm but what are some specific ideas you have for solving the shortage of special education teachers and parents and I would love if you could be a specific as possible please read art with I'm Alison I really appreciate this question\nI was a teacher Galileo and I'm holding my parents are more psychologists and so they were all my my on call resource and because I enjoyed working with students with disabilities I ended up getting more students in my class\nAnd um I had a para that was kind of the deal and it was one of the best teaching experiences I ever had um being able to teach a really diverse group of kids they can all see that they were valued and that they could all cell in different ways but I had the support that I needed and I think one thing that we do not do in our district and it leads to a teacher burnout it led to my burn out in ...\nFor foreign prop Thirteen so we gotta talk about that too but\nTeachers burned out because they're just they're overloaded and there's some schools that have more of a lower than others and we really have to acknowledge that and some teachers have more of that load in school and we really have no metric to see if you've got ten kids with ITs and two kids with diabetes\nThat's work that is currently not compensated for and that's the same with Paris too\nAnd we really need to come up with a metric to compensate teachers and really evaluate how hard they're working so that they have a manageable workload\nThank you learn\nA little disclosure here I or I was a special ed I was in the severely emotionally disturbed class because I Am trends [noise]\nAnd when I was in high school because of the class I went in and had therapy or we had to talk about her feelings [noise]\nNow I think we should actually get trans\nNon binary gender expansive teachers and Paris I think we need to recruit\nWe need to recruit people who traditionally have been ... by the education system and I think we need to do that now we need to start really looking and finding people who have\nThe fire in their belly for teaching and really bring those people to San Francisco Unified School district\nYou very much thank you\n[noise] um the next question is for um John and a leader teachers in San Francisco school districts make less money than some surrounding districts where do you think the money can come from to pay teachers and more competitive salary Alina\nI I guess I just want to talk about partnerships that's something we didn't really talk about follow that and I and others have been talking about whole community schools\nWe all we all benefit when we invest in our public schools and that's one of the reasons why I'm such I Am so in love with our public schools even when they're not perfect because they when we invest in our schools and we invest in other people's children and we all benefit and um\nI have a really strong track record of helping to bridge those gaps and create community because we can't do this alone none of us can and um because of that work\nI've been very successful in in helping our schools to really really be the vision that our district has set out\nTo create um and because of that I'm One of the only teachers have endorsed by the teachers union I'm endorsed by the San Francisco Democratic Party I'm endorsed by more board members and any other candidate um and or any others more supervisors than any other candidate and it's because I've been showing up there's a few of us that are educators and parents we've\nBeen showing up and doing the work and I would really appreciate your vote for that I can continue to do that work and continue to serve and and help the district realize his promises on for all children in the city thank you\n\nSo um\nI think it's very important to include people who are showing up and doing the work on the board and at the same time the district has been\nA electing people who've been in the system for really long time and already have high school age kids are already out of the schools are for a long time and there hasn't been substantive\nClosure of the achievement gap in Thirty years of effort\nSo thinking about what we can do differently is very important to me as someone who will be in the school system for another Fifteen Years with my two boys\nAnd one thing that I'm really passionate about is infrastructure\nUh it's so boring and sexy but when you think about chronic absenteeism it's only what's happening in the curriculum and with teachers that's very important but it is also the fact that and the baby asthma rates or four times as my hospitalization rates are four times higher we need to think about health\nAnd we need to think about transportation to get students into the classroom in the first place and we will be working on school assignment\nAt the same time we're working on a tenure capital plan for our facility if\nThat's what I'm excited to do and work for you\n[noise] [noise]\nSo first of all I just want to thank you goes off or coming and taking the time and listen to us you know I'm I'm a ... parents you guys probably retard and whatnot\nAnd so I definitely want to say thank you I'm I've been a schools when I was in K. to twelve you know I have all the reasons would be upset about the school district but I'm not right here in San Francisco unified because I understand that we it's it's hard I work in our district and I work with the teachers and be worth a try or people will try and I'm saying is you know um\nSome of our kids are not even making it to school right and and I'm leaving is with us 'cause you know this seems to be a group of people you know all of our to our important but some of our kids they're not making it\nRight and that's a duty not only with the school board with all of us here in his room you know so that's why mental health is my most important issue right if we if kids don't know that their loved that they're taking care of in the schools in at home\nIt we're not getting anywhere so when we talk about this opportunity right because it's not an achievement things one opportunity thing right we really have to get some models hierarchy in sort of dressed in court\n... election but [noise]\nI Want to thank you all for ah for listening tonight and all of us because we we can talk um [noise] and ah as a trans by Jewish parent I Will work by keep offer everybody and that every student ah I'm endorsed by evolve California which is trying to reform prop Thirteen\nUm and the clothes that are that are corporate loopholes\nAnd a trans United a bipolar the oldest a first bisexual political Action Network\nUm and uh the barrier reporter which is really exciting I'm public students public public school students are really important to me because you know have kids in the district and I want to see every single child succeed\nIf that means going out every single school and hanging out and getting snow every single family I'm going to do it on I've already started [laughter]\nBut uh I Hope that we can all come together and really make this district a beautiful place where every school is number one on someone's list\n[laughter]\nThinking thank you I've been gone for coming out today and thank you for all the organizer as he made this event happen I Know it takes a lot of effort to plant events and to get people to show up on so I ... and my first time candidate and the youngest candidate running this time around I'm twenty seven years old\nI have a degree in political policy but I'm Wise enough to know that\nI don't know everything and not fly I really love to our educators into our parents to teach me a thing or two along this process I've been really excited to have lots of great conversations across the city\nAnd I think what sets me really a part of that I not only how they use organizing experience I have\nExperience developing legislation implementing the legislation and including on passing free me an e for over fifty thousand young people helping to reauthorize the children's find which serves um provides a hundred million dollars a services to children and youth and I hope to earn your vote this November\n\nHow a thank you for having us first of all and thank you all for taking an active role in uh this process and and the the running of our school district\nUm I I firmly believe that the school district in the schools must serve the kids with ... for the needs that they have\nRather than providing a service that may or may not fit them that's why I'm a fan of community schools\nAnd arts or to allow kids to learn in the way the best suits them and express their learning through the arts and bring their culture into it uh we need to re imagined the schools so that they ... match the needs of students and families today um\n[noise] we need to make sure the money gets to the classrooms and ... a support the teachers so that they can teach our students because there's nothing more important it is the most important job there is\nLike you\nYeah thank you all very much for being here thanks to our organizers um education as a civil right I'm In education in itself shows safety net um you don't become a teacher because you want to get rich you become a teacher because you have the heart of\nThat's a fairly in of itself improve the outcomes in our classrooms um [noise]\nOne of my big platforms in my campaign is reading interventions I'm reading interventions are difficult to implement their expensive to implement if the kid reads differently or learns differently or has a challenge like dyslexia\nBut if you can't fundamentally teach a child to read and make that shouted confident reader um then they can't be successful in society\nAnd that is just one of the many examples of what we need to do to make our kids feel safe and supported and welcomed and valued at school if we had more than Ninety seconds I Would go on and on and on but thank you all for being here tonight\n[noise]\nOkay I'm I'm passionate about our public school that's why I've been doing this for as long as I have\nI'm I I Believe this is my responsibility to help honestly I was raised to serve my community and that's why I'm here and I want every family in the city to believe that our public schools are good enough for their kids in fact they're great and when everybody who hasn't had kids yet but it's considering it but think San Francisco's too expensive knows they can stay here because our public schools are great\nUm I Want um [noise] I Want you to know how much value um parents in this process and\nI have worked for families over so many years um as it help them start PTAs in their schools I have I work to create and half an after school for a policy with our city and our district leaders\nUm and I have a track record of being really committed approachable accessible responsive and I want you to know that you have a voice that I Will make room for your voice and if there's a question that I didn't get to answer for that was your question tonight email me Michelle and Michelle Parker dot org I'm happy to answer that\nUm and I have a strong support in this campaign of supported by the mayor all three of our state legislators which is important because so much happens at our state level related to our school most importantly I'm supported by lots of community members um and families and students and teachers\nThank you [noise] [noise]\nHi again and think you also for being here after long Monday I'm I just want to emphasize that my run for school board is an extension of my work\nOf what I've
