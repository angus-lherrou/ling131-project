workers alliance and co founder of black lives matter\n[noise]\n\nHey everybody know for real hey everybody [laughter]\nSo hello and welcome to tonight's program with in forum at the commonwealth club I Am ...\nGarza and I'm the principle of the black futures lab I Am the strategy and partnerships director for the national domestic workers alliance and I'm also one of the co creators of the black lives matter global network\n[noise]\nI Am super excited because we are here this evening with Rebecca Traister the author of big girls don't cry the election that changed everything for American women all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of the independent nation\nAnd all all\nGood and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger tonight we are discussing a topic that has been at the center of the national conversation this year which is women's rage and I just want to say quickly that um it's been a hard couple of\nYears [laughter]\nUm so we're really really really excited to have you here and please everyone give Rebecca warm walk um [noise]\nIt is I\nI just want to say it's such an honor to share the stage with at least you know who is also in the book [laughter] she is one of the most vibrant and nuance voices on women anger power politics I'm quoted in the book so it's a real thrill to be on the stage with the right now\nIt was such an honor actually to be interviewed and be included and I remember that interview and I remember during the interview getting really freaking angry\nSo we're going to do a little bit to night [laughter] um but I wanted to just start off honestly to say this is such a timely conversation\nI like many of you watched a month right of Supreme Court\nNominee deliberations I'm certainly through my fair share of cuss words at the television along with other objects I watched as Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nCourageously I told her story and her experience knowing that she was following in the footsteps of people like professor Anita Hill who also courageously put everything on the line to\nKind of share her experiences in front of a panel of angry white men and moves so we saw that repeated again although there may have been different voices there than there were um in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd some of the same during wrestling just family\nAnd I also am was incredibly moved\nBecause every time I wanted to throw something at the TV I Would hear screaming coming from the Senate chambers\nAnd somebody screaming I Do not consent somebody screaming all kinds of things right and actually during the boat itself I mean I was sitting there\nBecause as they were going through the vote they kept having to say sergeant and arms clear that chamber because you would hear women screaming this is not okay\nThere's a concentrated effort to control power at the very top\nI'm In a way that will actually work to suppress the power of protesters in my social movements going forward and also to reverse the progress that has been made by century's worth of social and political movements that have\nVia mass action protest electoral activation like civic participation\nUm worked over the course of American history to make this country's slightly better a little bit at a time and now the power that has been challenged by that history once she put in place mechanisms is working to preserve their power\nBy ensuring a court that can reverse\nAll kinds of ... all lots of that progress not just row which has been talked about a lot but further got voting rights got collective bargaining rights they the ability of workers to organize\nUm that that's the big picture of what's going on which has power tightening at the top in reaction I'm In part to the anger coming\nFrom those with less power the thing that I'm so glad that you talked about the protestors because\nEven before there were the allegations of assault I was so moved by the protesters in the original hearings and there's a way in which a political media now they have is though the only challenge that was brought\nTo Kavanaugh came with the with the assault allegations in the protest that happened in in response\nBut in fact I was so moved to the first time and this was you know a few weeks before I was going to publish this book it was I was very worried during the summer that there wasn't active resistance to the cabinet nomination that everybody was going to roll over that the Democrats were going to roll over and\nAnd I think there are very many legitimate ways to to criticize the the Democrats approach to the Kavanaugh nomination\nBut my fear going into September was there's not going to be any challenge to this what I understood to be the stranglehold that a Trump Administration was going to put in place the a lifetime appointment\nAnd so for me the opening day of hearings and Linda is our source was I Believe was the first person to stand up and scream\nAnd then it wasn't just Linda it wasn't just Bob Bland it wasn't just the the next woman or the next room it was this endlessly renewable\nUm raged coming from women who would come into the chamber standup scream be taken out arrested and then more women would come and stand up and scream and that was moving to me even before we got\nTo the assault allegations and the post ... protest that erupted after them\nAnd and for me I Would say especially after the pain of watching the testimony day and watching Christine Blasey Ford half\nTo tell her story within such a narrow range of expression that we all understood she had to stay between these lines that she could not raise your voice that she could not be angry on her own behalf that she could not\nAppear anything other than solicit is polite deferential reasonable science based in order to make her store it in order for her story to be taken seriously and and be heard as credible and then having watched\nBrett Kavanaugh come in and be able to use anger as a rhetorical\nTo bolster his position he could use the snarling bluster and fury to amplify the righteousness of his cause and that is very much in line with what I've been writing about in this book about how the the fury that we take seriously politically in this country has always been a few ...\nTheir fury but when that fury has been aimed at a white patriarchal\nGovernment it is discounted and marginalized and written off as crazy or dangerous um and yet we revere the anger and ... and are trained to reflexively respect and and treated diagnostic the anger of of angry powerful white men\nAnd I'd watch that happen and it was so\nSad to me to watch that and understand that night that that was probably going to work for him that he was going to get to use that weapon and it was going to cement his place for his lifetime on this court that was gonna then exert control over\nSo many bodies in so many lives the most moving point for me was the next day seeing the video\nOf ana Maria Sheila yup and Maria Gallagher in that elevator and they weren't the only ones there are others you know I'm just morale is I'm confronting Ted Cruz and also with my squad [laughter]\nAnd Allison Turk goes a confronting Joe mansion\nAnd there were these activists going the power of seeing those two women in the elevator\nPointing fingers doing a thing that we have been told we're not allowed to do pointing fingers at a powerful white man and ... and demanding you look at me look at me when I tell you the story of my life and my experience in Wyoming this elevator you look at me meet my eyes it was so powerful\nExactly that rhetoric and incredibly powerful anger that is happening in response to some of the symbolic victories of Brock Obama and the inevitable presidency of Hillary Clinton and\nIncluding black lives matter um and yet the actual anger at that time and and anxiety about the impact of that kind of racism and massage and he was downplayed\nThen you have Bernie who was also really terrific at communicating a crucial in righteous anger about economic inequality and he was great it that he and Trump were both able to use their anger\nIn ways that they were applauded for as a political tool right and and they were very good at it\nHillary was both bad at it just or rhetorically not gifted at conveying passion I think you know that it's very hard to divorce\nHer oratorical gift from the kinds of messages that she was probably sent for her entire life is where it gets really complicated always to talk about Hillary\nUm and when she talked to too loudly enter microphone she was accused of being shrill and loud and she was yelling hum but there was another thing internally that then happens\nWhich is that when protesters disrupt both when black lives matter protesters disrupt both Hillary and Bernie they are cast by the political media and by the supporters of those campaigns it's fundamentally disruptive\nRight you screwed up the events like no that's not no they're good on this trust as they are good on that apparently we screwed up the election yeah yeah right right you know what I'm saying yes not the fifty three percent not to fifty three percent\nBut and black lives matter right just checking yeah\nPretty much know what I mean yeah yeah right so that is that's exactly that's like we're in a progressive sphere is not just like\nOh the anger of progressive as the current that is the less powerful the anger of the masses are of the oppressed or the subjugated is the thing that's cast as disruptive within a progressive sphere the anger of the less powerful entity is cast as\nThe problematic force [noise]\nI\nLive in a little bit more because this isn't the first time that anger has been written about\nAnd I was thinking through some of my teachers and mentors and I started thinking about a tree lord course and she wrote a beautiful piece\nCalled the uses of anger where she's really getting into this dialogue about essentially what's getting in the way of us building the kind of movement and together that will be impactful and accountable and effective\nAnd so if I can she says anger expressed and translated into action\nIn the service of our vision and our future is a liberating and strengthening active clarification for it is in the painful process of this translation\nThat we identify who are our allies with whom we have grave differences and who are gentlemen genuine enemies anger is loaded with information and energy when I speak of women of color I Do not only mean black woman\nThe woman of color who was not black who charges me with rendering her invisible by assuming that her struggles with racism or identical with my own\nHas something to tell me that I better learn from\nLess we both waste ourselves fighting the troops between us if I participate knowingly or otherwise in my sister's oppression and she calls me on it to answer her anger with my only blankets the substance of our exchange with reaction it wastes energy and yes it is very difficult\nTo sit still to a standstill\nAnd to listen to another woman's voice delineate an agony I Do not share or one to which\nI myself have contributed so we get into this in the book where essentially yes there was a lot\nAnd on the left and as our kind of teachers have taught us and we cannot separate these dynamics of race and gender right so I guess my question here is what can we learn in this moment two years in right\nI'm about the kinds of alliances that we need to be building how do we move through these dynamics where\nFrankly I'm a feminist\nYou're a feminist but I think for a lot of my crew they're like well I'm not a white feminism is not my thing\nAnd then there's just not a lot of people who know about black Semitism which is literally a it is a clarification of how it ain't feminism if it doesn't include all of us [noise]\n\nHow do we do it well I think that one of the major questions posed by the book is is coalition any better coalition possible and I can't claim to answer that question there are a lot of different voices in the book offering opinions\nI think that Audrey lord vision is one of the more optimistic visions because and and it's one that\nIs echoed by Linda source or who says contentious dialogue is by design that's in the run up to the women's march where so many of the very old angers within a women's movement were brought to the fore because in the literally the days after\nNinety four percent of black women vote for Hillary Clinton and fifty three percent of white women vote for now forty five I'm gonna I'm gonna start doing it too [laughter]\nIn the days after it is white women who suggests a march on Washington and promptly hall at the million woman march which is an appropriation of a demonstration staged and led by black women itself an outgrowth or or or a a response to\nDemonstrate the million Man March and what could be more emblematic of\nSort of failures of taking responsibility and the appropriate the impulse toward appropriation than those dynamics but what happened in in that from those first days in which you saw so much old history and there is so much history it extends back centuries\nOf women of color black women leading the way of doing the the revolutionary thinking and organizing and then being raised within the movement that they've laid the groundwork for and that is a lot of the history of the women's movement extending back to the beginning of time in this country\nAnd so in this moment in the days after this election\nWhich so many white women are truly like horrified furious and traumatized I don't mean to take anything away from the anger and shock that that so many people it's fundamental it's crucial this anger and shock felt by women who had not who had previously not been angry and that way had not seen\nCertain things in the world in that way but what happened in the intervening period was that women from other movements came in women of color they insisted on the ideological tenants and principles of the women's march\nBeing intersection make making clear how impressions are inter locked\nThey made clear that we were going to have the conversation about race there was not going to be a women's march if there was not an open and often very difficult conversation about this kind of oppression and white supremacy within the history of a women's movement there were all kinds of course immediately it was written about as you know is it more divisive is it\nKnow of anger and resentment and inequalities within progressive fears are in every mass movement it is not unique to the women's movement mhm [noise]\nUm and quickly the divisions were used to sort of say oh this is all falling apart well what happened is it was the biggest single one day political protests in this country's history and those millions of women many of whom were very new activism something like a third\nOf them it was the first protest they'd ever attended were they're marching side by side with the domestic workers alongside\nBanners about environmental racism criminal justice and there were some there was contentious dialogue there were\nThere was the famous sign all the all you ... nice white lady that the next black lives matter march right [noise]\nMhm [noise]\nAnd we're still we're still waiting [laughter]\nAnd\nUh you know this is the this is this is I Want to be optimistic but I'm also very keenly aware of my waiting is right the white lady being optimistic about other white lady this is not always persuasive and that's why part of my job\nIs at this point is to actually talk to white women about the history the contacts the power dynamics\nUm because if I Can't just be optimistic that things are going to get better I Do agree with Linda SARS or an Audrey lord that the contentious dialogue and that and the difficult conversations and the anger between\nPotential allies can be deliberate has engendered which is the word that Audrey lord uses that it can produce the stronger movement I think that the ... and\nAnd um differences within a women's movement our strength because it permits us the chance to grow and change with the times and it permits has to be better than we have been in the past [noise] I\nTo do your activism that way by interrupting dinners or by screaming and people in elevators it's so awful that's connected force don't it's not civil it lets people know that there are others who feel the same it let somebody watching on a computer somewhere very far away from Washington DC who is limited and\nAnd upset and sad\nAnd still furious about what's happening and let them hear a voice that reflects that sadness and fury back to them I Know that somebody is yelling at this guy ... ... and make them understand that they're not living in isolation\nThat they are part of a mass anger at the kind of power abuses that we're living with right now mhm there is tremendous value to that incivility but it's just a part of what's happening\nSo let's go the civility thing and let's start moving towards that building power thing\nAnd transforming power because quite frankly it is great to get more women elected it's great to get more folks of color elected but if we're putting people in the same structures that are ultimately not made for our power\nThan we're really just replacing one group of people with another but we're not actually transforming how it works so you said\nTwo things that were fascinating to me in this book and one was\nThis piece around anger and self care is\nSo there was something in here where he said or you interviewed someone who said something to the degree of like folk always want us to move through anger to a thing yeah so you can't just be angry because anger is explosive and it's considered divisive and it's considered to be not\nProductive particularly when it's coming from limits but it's it's a conversation to be had about\nHow it is that we use anger productively ... a how do we keep ourselves from using anger in ways that cuts us off at the knees when we need to be moving together and\nThe other piece of my question frankly is you know with all the rhetoric that I hear every day when I turn on CNN about extremists and mobs and all of that\nThing is there hope for women's anger to finally be seen as what has transformed this country is there hope for that okay [laughter] the the first\nQuestion oh yeah and I'm five minutes till ... so you get your question of any so the first part of that\nAnd it's really fascinating because there is there's so much baggage attached to anger as a divisive confrontational fundamentally poisonous and corrosive force right\nUm I think that women here a lot about a lot more about that about how it poisons us and fundamentally deformed us it makes us unattractive ugly threatening of course the way it's framed depend so much on our race\nAnd class position and power that we have when we voice it but in in almost all women it's discouraged in one way or another in less it's on anger on behalf of a white patriarchy in which case you get Phyllis Schlafly and Susan Collins and you know the women at the Tea Party and the women shaking their fists at kids trying to integrate schools [noise]\nThat kind of women's anger is pretty much the only one that's encouraged by the power structure and its anger that is deployed on behalf of the power structure but otherwise we're told all the time that our anger is explosive and destructive and bad for us physically bad for us um\nAnd I I don't want to pretend that there there are those destructive qualities in anger and part of what we're talking about tonight is how anger between allies can sever\nI Do want to talk about the message that women are never given which is that there are all kinds of positive joy is liberating aspects of anger and some of the poison\nAnd corrosive impact come from being told that we're not to express it\nThat if we express it it's going to be bad for us it is going to make us unattractive and scary and undermined the very project we're so committed to seeing through if we if we start speaking in angry tones and so we hold it in or we redirected in places where it's not really supposed to go\nAnd it can explode it can make it to me I think there there is a very valid argument that to change the way we receive in here and respect women's anger and acknowledge it as politically consequential\nAs part of the force it one of the key forces that has reshaped and transformed this country over centuries\nIf we value it was even a fraction of the value we we offered to white man's angered powerful women's anger it could actually anger could be just an emotion that's integrated in the full range of human expression and rational reaction but the other thing is anger in a political context is connected it's not just divisive\nAnd there are a lot of examples of this one of the places where it was made clear to me it was when I went to Georgia in the summer of twenty Seventeen and talked to some of the newly activated\nSuburban white women who had been politically apathetic had lived in red areas never put a yard sign out because you have voice there sort of private democratic leanings would have been disruptive\nWould have made them unattractive within their communities would have would have caused problems\nUm and then in the wake of the twenty sixteen election we're so mad that they yelled mhm\nAnd then when they yelled they discovered that a woman down the block was also they became audible to each other and then once they realize that there was a woman two doors down who'd felt the same way all this time and that they've been living for decades\nThinking that they were the only ones because they never expressed their dissent then they become became unable to each other and the next thing you know they'd like joined indivisible and we're spending twenty four hours a day knocking on doors not just for you I was there right before the Jon Ossoff\nElection and he lost they had been doing it for other candidates and they have kept doing it since and they're out there right now working for Stacey Abrams and Lucy McBath\nAnd [noise] and\nAre they are politically activated people and it does not mean that there are progressive ism is perfect and that everybody you know but but they are committed in in a new way and part of that was because of that anger bubbled over in a way that that could then draw them together into coalition and the beginnings of organization\nIs part of what does that and I do think we have to stop this development and start crediting it if you look back\nAt the movements that have transformed the nation from abolition suffrage the labor movement the civil rights movement\nThe gay rights movement the women's movement of the Nineteen seventies\nYou will find at the beginning of all those movements women who were angry at injustice and that anger was what spurred them out of their homes out of the domestic sphere into public speaking roles into scholarship into legal work to start fighting cases that we're going to transform the legal system\nInto petitioning for their own freedom you find that at the beginning of all these movements and yet we're never taught to respect women's anger as politically consequential as patriotic\nAs key to the slow process of trying to make this country adjusts a more just place but it is right there it is the under current under all of it\nAnd I think we're not taught it because the power structure fears it because it knows what it can do you know what happened over the past two weeks and and the Republicans out there talking about the angry mobs of screaming animals at the same\nAre they know the power of anger they want their base to be angry\nThey're saying it's qualifying\nAnd they're trying to gin it up on their side they know the power of anger and we should know the power of our anger to I heard that so if your question [noise]\n\nIf you have fights and we want you to\nCome back here to the Mike there's gotta be tons of questions\nPlease high so quick question um two parts so what was what was your most favorite or the most valuable thing that you learned in writing this book and what resources would you suggest that people go to if they want more after your book to learn more great\nQuestion a great question the most surprising thing that I learned well there's actually a particular story which I didn't really know about which is what happened at the stonewall inn\nUm I in you know part of the process of being a journalist a feminist journalist has been learning all kinds of history I was never taught [noise]\nUm and I sort of knew a popular version of\nThe gay rights movement as it erupted out of the stonewall inn on a ... June night and a series of June nights Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nUm I understood the gay rights movement as a fundamentally a white male white male lead movement and I kind of knew as a footnote in my in my brain that like oh Sylvia Rivera was was it stone wall that night\nAnd I kind of oh and Marcia ... there was like something that was in my head that was like I think it was more complicated than that and I went back and I read and they're all kinds of conflicting reports about what happened at stone wall and so there's not\nThere's not ones that story but a lot of the reports all reflect\nA similar thing which is that two female identifying people of color and a lesbian named stormy to love ya were three of the initial insiders of what became the insurrection at the stonewall inn mhm [noise]\nAnd I'd never heard of ... uh she was a a lesbian of color and she reportedly fought police when they took her out of the bar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inforum from The Commonwealth Club", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
