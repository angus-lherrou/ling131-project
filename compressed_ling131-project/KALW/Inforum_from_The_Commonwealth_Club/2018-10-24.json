elementary and high school level and that it is moving to include world language with the middle school redesign speaking another language and knowing deeply about other cultures\nMakes us more open minded more social more inclusive more competent and more prepared to tackle the twenty first century [noise]\nThey do offer language options my hope is that this resolution pushes world language to the forefront so that speaking another language other than English becomes a district norm\nOur children and not just some should be offered the gift of sneaking another language and knowing deeply another culture it shouldn't depend on parent advocacy\nBecause that in in of itself is an equitable showdown from different socioeconomic backgrounds are geographical locations in the city should all

elementary school level to study a foreign language and the culture or culture as it comes from\nA twenty first century global citizen should be prepared to communicate on a global level and understand the multitude of cultures they interact with on a daily basis whether at home or abroad and studying language in elementary school is imperative to achieving proficiency in another language\nWell San Francisco is a world leader and many fields such as technology business the arts and diversity we should also be leaders in preparing our children to succeed through education that includes a commitment to foreign languages and cultures\nI Believe that the world languages council would provide the necessary support to maintain the strength and integrity of our foreign language

because if we can establish reading verify three thank you\n[noise]\nHello I'm good evening I'm my name's out from Collins and I'm a parent at Francisco middle school and I'm also an active member of a pack\nI wanted to speak about um what\nAre they part presentation and also common we know racism and is is an issue in our country it's an issue in our city and it's obviously an issue in our schools as we see there are some great work going on in our district nonetheless that has been my experience as a parent that black families in other families have had to consistently advocate\nUm to make sure that the district lives up to its vision of culturally safe and supportive schools\nAnd my daughter schools I have had to ask why black children were told to pick up trash in the schoolyard as resorted practices I've had to ask why there are no black or Latino next authors taught in my daughter's English classes I have had to organize with other black families in order to make sure that black history is celebrated in my daughter's schools\nI have had to inform staff at my school that my daughter's peers have joked about the KKK and said black people are stupid within the regular course of their day\nThis year I had to help my Thirteen year old daughter navigate a state wide project\nWhich included the Confederate flag it's the Mississippi flagged by the way I had to help her include important history not taught in the class on the ways that that flag within the flag has been used to promote racial chair and white supremacy that's a lot to a whole\n[noise] with the experiences such as these it's no wonder why black children in slam families sometimes don't show up or do well in our schools\nHow can we say that we as a district are committed to safe and supportive schools when we are committed to addressing racism and bias with educators parents and students when we have an opt in model for addressing racism\nYou're after your organizations like a pack and climbing and individual families like me ask for the district to commit to diverse literature implicit bias and restore to practice training and pre K through Thirteen through twelve ethnic studies at all cites\nFamily should not have to ask for our schools to be culturally safe\nI'm asking the district to hold itself accountable and report instead of just reporting on test scores report which schools engage in anti racist professional development report which schools are actively celebrating black history repeats and take an inventory of disco teachers are teaching and our middle and high school English classes thank you\n[noise] [noise]\nMy name is Julia Roberts from and and I wanted to speak to how troubling\nCriminals report is ensuring that the a disproportionate impact of suspensions on African American families is is white on again\nAnd and it shouldn't really be a surprise to us and we passed a safe in support of schools ordinance but we only implemented it for a brief period of time and when we did implement it we saw that get closer and we saw suspensions going down\nAnd but then we didn't actually continue to implement it and we know that are teachers change from year to year school staff changes from year to year families continue to change when you have consistent implementation from the district\nUm infamous capital of the districts not always implementing the progressive policies that we passed we really soon families step up and say I want to think a pack and for all the work that they've been doing um\nOur school last year and a pack and recite black families met with different principles and\nI'm In our school and in other north side schools and it was one of the first year so that we had black history month celebrated in all of our classrooms and the two things that were really powerful about that was having a family is asking for that on him and also having superintendent Matthews asking questions about\nHey what are we doing this year now so that power of having the district asking questions and measuring what we're doing and having families and advocate at is really powerful\nAnd it's been a huge change for our school and what you even though there's only three percent of our families who are white can still feel like a really white space so we managed to celebrate black history month for the first time in this year we're actually celebrating\nOutlet Latin next History Month and all the various heritage month so it's really opened black families open space for all the diverse families in our schools that have their cultures and history celebrated [noise]\nWe've also seeing that I'm an okay it's headed drastic drop in suspensions they went from being in the middle school with the highest percentage of suspensions to being the lowest and he's a whole community school approach and part of the power that approaches actually using um including students family and staff voices in decision making\nSomeone asked that we do that at the district level and make sure that when a pack makes recommendations we're implementing them in centering them in policies like the student assignment policy and I hope that next year we'll have more than three items crossed off a pack list thank you\n[noise]\nUh I'm my name's Lisa long I have two children and the mission high school like waiters or
