Robert producer an entrepreneur MC Hammer\nOr [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh that was a really warm reception there [laughter] hello every one where the commonwealth club I'm M. C. hammer and tonight I had the pleasure of being in conversation with gray\nAnd it is a pleasure by the way I Am twenty four team during the midst of all the brutality unrest the re rose to national prominence in our stop right there and let's give him another hand [noise]\nBefore\nWe have been let me just say it's an honor to be on the stage with M. C. M. sees a friend and a legend\nI did read here\nHe is even colder than you want them to be I'm excited for him they say histories than I Do and it really is an honor to all of you came out tonight\n[noise] thank you thank you I'm a\nI don't think I'd rather be anywhere else so this is this something you know life is a a a journey and certain things you want to make sure that you were a\nBit your voice was heard you were not silence and if you were a counted in the moment so I'm as you know I express myself I'm going to pass 'em your work and what you've done in your courage has been very important to us or I wouldn't want to be any place else tonight\nOn with that being said I Do want to say a\nCouple of words are that are on board for people to understand uh one of the word brutality and when you look toward brutality up\nThe definition is defined as Savage physical violence in great cruelty\nSo I'm anybody wonder or who has\nA any misgivings a misunderstanding of what this is all about\nUm this is about voices crying out saying that uh we don't want to be brutal lives and I think if you listen to that definition you get a better understanding this is this is about people standing up saying hey I Am I'm a I'm a human being\nI'm a person a family man woman and a brutality just doesn't fit with uh\nWith my person in or um\nMy beliefs and then the second thing is injustice which\nReally are casually the same things cruelty ... repression exploitation bias prejudice discrimination and intolerance\nSo would that being like the foundation of uh this this great conversation and we're only going to have about forty minutes or to really get into it um I just wanted to leave that as as a foundation and then jump into things and also say that we want to have a\nUh about Fifteen or twenty minutes McEwen a at the end of this and a maybe a little more\nMaybe a little more maybe that All right\n\nDo I want to jump right into and and again I Want I Want to thank you for the book the book is substance a and there's so many things out there today that are not substance I'm I I told you you don't it back to if I were to actually teach from the book\nThe book can be taught for years income it would take time because obviously I'm\nYou were very meticulous and your thoughts on what you wanted to communicate with this book so I Want everybody to know that if you don't have the book or you know some people who don't have the book go out and get the book because it it will enlighten you in so many uh aspects it\nIt really will he found literally will believe that [noise]\nYou you know but a lot of people don't read and uh also uh with\nUm the way news and information is fair to us is always a leaning in one direction or the other so and and you talk about truth a lot in the book you talk about truth and so people can't really properly to buy or disseminate truth\nIf you I'm really dive into the book you you'll get a better understanding of it is true of the truth of this struggle and the truth of things that led to protests\nAnd I look for books like that I look for books um that can um to give more fuel to the conversation and put it in proper context and this with the book does and with that being said or ... or do you want to ask you\nThis is this protest is the work of hope protests at its core is telling the truth and public\nIt is the confrontation and disruption rooted in the acknowledgement of a future that has not yet come but that is possible to work at hand is hope we're so you describe it is hope or tell us more about\n[noise] yeah I think about um you know people talk about truth and reconciliation all the time and don't want to acknowledge it the truth has to come before the reconciliation right\nAnd that when we think about this record that we would tell the truth is our bodies we sit in the street to say that we don't know everything but we don't like to be alive today that was like what we felt confident in that was a well kept us in the street every night\nAnd like when I think about the work of hope hope is that belief that out tomorrow can be better not today's hope when king says it the more of the universe bends towards the justice that's about faith and belief in things and see when\nWe say that the ... because the people that that is a statement about hope\nI think about why people on the street people running for office all that to me is hope ark and like I'm obsessed with that like what does that mean\nHad to be committed to this and I think about the work of telling the truth is like sometimes the uncomfortable work but the important work I you know I was at this um\nThis is not a humble bragging I just want to provide the contacts [laughter] how was that um I was at miss Tina's party beyond his mom and\nThere was a [laughter] like uh the\nIs important I meant that she has its wearable our party every year and so we have to like where art so I'm going I'm ran this like plastic coat thing that has for quote doing it and one of the or has for facts one factor all true is that uh we're as more people for we'd all island crimes combined\nA that one in five black men in Florida can vote that is true and then one of them was that white high school dropouts have more wealth than all black college graduates which is true\nSo this guy walks up to me he's like is that true and he's a white record exec in like a major place 'cause this is the party so he is like is that true and I go faster and he was like well during the reason why people have more wealth is that they're more white people\nAnd I'm like you know like right this party is I Can't like flip out so I'm just like [laughter] I'm like oh that's really interesting and I'm like [noise]\n'cause like what else do you say you know so I'm like you know the only reason they're more white people because you kill half the people in and slave the other half an hour [laughter] he is like ... like he's like I don't know and I'm like this isn't something that you get to not know write like that just happened [noise]\nBut it's just a vote when I think about that in the Congress as question it's like the truth about wealth is that we gave people wealth right we did we just gave we gave people how this\nWas ... percent loans for a long time we gave them free education like we gave it to them and when you think about people of color and poor people all of a sudden nobody has any imagination they're like we don't know what to do it's like we already do it right like\nWe did it once before and Mike I'm obsessed with that then like if we can rewrite the tax code and the backup paper towels and napkins and scrap paper then like we can actually do all of this and a generation that this doesn't have to be a five hundred years solution of six hundred your solution they literally\nThat can be like you really rooted in a\nMoment when I think about hope hope to me as a few of my faith is tied to test it often do I think it's necessarily gonna change but do I think it can change I Do and I know that are only get their when their people like imagining a different world like fighting for something they haven't seen before that to me as a homework\nWhile that now if that was a lot to consume from that small question so\n[noise]\nNow don't worry we got it all [noise] yeah\nAnd it was a it was entertaining at the same time but that's the old style you you you bring a lotta substance and then you give us a little laughter what does that make the medicine go down a little bit better but it's still strong medicine I'm ...\nBefore he asked that question we were together at a disadvantage [laughter] and um he no these are the lights on glasses he normally where Dr thing [laughter]\nExactly right exactly right so we're together and somebody like you know do they like to re so good to meet you and I'm like what you mean my friend M. C. and I just I introduce some kind of [laughter] San jose hammer cars that gives it away [laughter] I'm like [laughter] see and that brings in little I Wish I had videotaped her she's like Oh hi Mr him see and then she's like empty [laughter]\nEvery every time they see the lights and glasses you know it's ... it's really\nAnd there's so many people today who like literally can't think about collective action outside of organizations and like you can be a member of things during the chapter is something that's fine too but that's not the only way that you can make a difference and I think\nBest peanut butter and jelly sandwich maker you've ever seen I made like amazing sandwiches I was like what we did in somebody's cautious kitchen we like made a ton of sandwiches and like people forget those stories UC UC events like this and you don't see me sleeping on the side of the road like MS Margaret house on this\nReally special air mattress with the cat walking all everywhere you know like you didn't see those those are the stories that I Try and lift up in that chapter of like all the people that had been forgotten along the way but if not for them there is no movement mama cat that was a woman who made dinner for protestors like Sunday nights\nAnd that would be the only meal that a lot of people got like we'd be out for like seven PM like for I Am you know and nothing would be open because they were afraid of the protesters so like at midnight if you're hungry it's like where did you go and like people stepped up you know there were people who like\nThey'll bring up the grill and they would like grill hotdogs or hamburgers ... it was so much community and like those things had been forgotten but we remember them because we were there and I wanted to use the book as a way to bring those stories back\nOr it's fantastic and ... ... ... and actually you you you told them a great version of it there but in the book is even more powerful um and actually want to quote\nUnquote it from the book because it was a real\n... from the book [laughter]\nSo years before any of us would take the streets of calls for verse affirming his important\nIn August mark is Anthony hunter or gay black man and now the chair of African American studies at UCLA he was studying black migration as a professor who studies he was thinking of ways of challenging students and others to think about blackness\nAs defined not only by skin color but also by our relationship to in a way from power and to realize that we when we consider blackness Annette since we find that most\nPeople are politically black as that's real heavy for for us to even consider our relationship to power in a way from power and and and I think when you do look at it that way ... more people would consider themselves politically\nThey have a better understanding what it is to be politically you know black from that from that perspective\nAnd he you know that somebody should do a whole piece on markets hunter like they should people should write about him you know I talked to him and he was like\nHe was like when you look at how cities have been formed like the what black people they've determined almost everything like where black people chose to go where they were excluded from\nLike where they died like that with like a the ... that actually has a defining part of how America became America so he was like well he treated black lives matter he was saying like that there is no he was a different version of there is no America without black people because he said like what black people did and how their bodies move like reshaped American ... ways\nAnd it was interesting because he has just been forgotten in the larger narrative about both the movement about the hash tag about like how we talk about this the right place and I wanted to use the book is a way to re surface that\nGood good this is good because again on the narrative got hijacked and the narrative got the the hash tag got hijacked so well when you say black lives matter and ... I mean depending on who you're talking to it means a totally different thing for some people a wall go up immediately\nThe black lives matter Black Panthers I just say Black Panthers the black lives\nMatter black lives matter\nWhere the guns that I didn't say anything about violence as a matter of fact the only thing I spoke about violence was again is when we started this conversation or said brutality and I've defined what brutality is and\nBlack lives matter to me means I don't want to be brutalized black lives matter to you for some reason means Black Panthers and even met narrative got hijacked but that will be a different conversation but it means without substance\nI'm all these other things that are that come from I don't know ah again people's ability to hijack the narrative but it certainly is not what the origin of what black lives\nMatter is and was in to this point and again in in the book you are is is very well stated overtime and we're talking about markets are Anthony hunter UCLA overtime he had come to an awareness\nOf an irrefutable truth that black migration and movement is the defining characteristics of growth in cities and\nAlways has been that what black lives choose to do matters significantly listen very closely in on August twenty twenty twelve he fired off a tweet check out these amazing articles by gene twenty three Bain and all the mores\nNew ad of context magazine hash\nTag black lives matter he was explaining about the power of the migration and influence and if that black people have and that was the origin of black lives matter and a at a later time and you could expound more about this but during focusing which um\nI was there I mean the your jacket so that\nMeans [laughter] vest [laughter]\nI just see the best but uh I ran into a lot of people there were a information and I like the I like the analogy and the reason why I'm huge huge change from hashtags frozen over to ... black black lives matter talk about\nYou remember in the early days like we were all treating has hurt us and that was like what we did that was like what we treated and has like Mike brown but it was but Ferguson sort of took off\nAnd what was happening though is that the trolls were like also starting to flood aspect Ferguson and we just couldn't all of a sudden it stopped being like a a powerful way for us to to organize which was actually really hard\nAnd then there were people who came down with a sign that said by husband I remember we couldn't stand still so like we were really making a lot of signs and stuff 'cause like we couldn't stay in stone who wants to like lugging around assigned as you're like walking down the street\nSo it's really a lot of people who came to visit like they were bringing a lot of times and we would like that's great 'cause like we didn't have you know to make assigned you have to be still and like we can do\nSo people bring signs and there are a lot of times and then with the has had black lives matter and we I remember the days and we just started to read it out and it became you know we think about hashtags is really great ... paper clips for conversations and it became like a really do paper clip and it blew up and like that was a big deal what was interesting about St Louis though is that\nLike we had such a great tunnel vision you know like being in the street it's like I have an eight hundred falls on the protest started I'd like ten dollars and fifty thousand a hundred thousand but the reality of it in St Louis I had the same amount of influence as I had at five thousand that I did have five hundred thousand because we were like so sort of just television and what was in front of us\nIt wasn't until I like travelling I sat in St Louis and I realized that like everybody across the country had been watching everything that we had been doing\nA and when I look back on Twitter and makes me I'm a little sad now because people are like trying to get they they wanna be famous and why be miserable on the platforms and like we just didn't even we didn't even know that was happening because when you think about St Louis they you know Mike Brown's name but the police killed nine people right after my round they killed ... nine days later you know it's like\nIt just happened over and over and over in St Louis\nAnd I write about some of the data in the book is in St Louis St Louis is the St Louis region has the highest rate of police violence in the country\nSo that could actually makes sense that the protests started an originated there but it was really wild to think back and I remember I Would go to other places and people have like watching a live stream and like we used to ... you know we knew the police are watching a live stream 'cause we saw them watch it\nBut we didn't know like other people were I remember being one of the ...\nHe just wasn't in the car and we said we were staying in my car and like we could see the live stream like on his police car like\nComputer you know it was like you were watching us and we knew those people watch it we had no clue that like the world was watching in the way it was which has been interesting the last thing I say about social media is I've seen the good and bad of it right like the first person ever permanently banned from Twitter was banned for trying to raise money to give me killed so that was not cool\nAnd then I've seen the really cool part three I've seen people come together and build community\nThat guy actually has a White House press credentials which is wild like outside name come up with like why is he not gone somewhere but he's still around which is not fun and I see some of my friends from Twitter yeah Sam Hi guys\nYou just you you brought up a subject discovered extensively in her um as well which is the relationship between the community and police and\nAnd this is a specific paragraph here we said what we quickly realized is that the federal government could tell you how many inches of rainfall there was in rural Missouri area in the Eighteen hundreds\nBut it could not provide reliable statistics on the number of people that police killed last year let alone all the other forms of police fathers impacting communities around this time or you had a gentleman uh the joined you joined organization Sam Sam we love\nA young a policy expert and data scientist in San Francisco or he reached out via Twitter about what's an interesting proposal\nHe'd been engaged in policy and thought he had an a and thought he had been with us in a in although we had been with you industries verbs and he knew that if the protests were ever to have a impact\nThat they would need data informed data set of demands that yet to emerge and so he he wanted to introduce utilizing I'm\nPolice violence is so prevalent in black community that the majority of black youth have either personally experienced a witness police violence in their lives\nAnd there was no accountability for this violence in Ninety seven percent of all police killings the criminal justice system does not charge officers with any crimes and in Ninety nine percent of the cases the officer is not convicted so\nThose numbers are what they are those facts are what they are the facts and prove they just don't stand on a stand on their own\nMerit and it's not it's not anybody specifically pointing to a specific person we just pointing to a specific reality it's just reality and who wouldn't want\nTo I'm On a very personal level\nWho wouldn't want to be next to somebody any human being who wouldn't want to say hey man I don't want you to kill my children I don't want you to be my kids\nI don't want you to take my sons and daughters and put them in jail I couldn't hang out with a person who didn't want to ... wouldn't want to protect their own family and their greater family in any aspect of that or from any aspect of that and so those are the numbers\nThat we're dealing with the reality that we're dealing with nobody has said every police you meet as a bad person nobody is said there were talking about an institution and we're talking about facts and and we want to rectify and fix the facts and take away a\nYou have a quote in the book or the bad apple whatever the case is or if the whole ... ...\n... it's like not a bad apple that barrel [laughter] here like the bad apple whatever the case is I'm I'm ... around like the unarmed is really interesting is that like life who actually more likely to be an armed and not threatening which is interesting like that it's like not the public near that\nPeople also sort of do the like all communities are dangerous thing\nAnd therefore after three is a dangerous and the police have to be there and because of police are there there's obviously like a spike and police found and the date actually doesn't show that either that there is no relationship between community around some police found in some places very\nHigh rates of community bounds of extremely low rates of police found and vice versa so that was interesting for us in like an but that is in the book I'm In that chapter but\nWhen I think about the book in general it is like if some of the protest some other police and then there are two essays\nI write about my mother for the first time I'm a mother left when I was three came back when I was thirty and I read on being gay and I've never written a you know I've treated not being gay and lord knows I've done a lot of interviews are being gay but I've never written about it\nAnd wait a minute ... you do any\nOf 'em [laughter]\nEver see the guys [laughter]\nWow [laughter] find things new out every\nDay because I Am because I wanted to make sure that you don't mind for that we Chavez hold people in all of these rooms you know and like there was no way for me so that after about Jones was my mother is called um\n[noise] I can remember now the sadness\nBecause she left when I was three I'm thirty three she came back when I was thirty our house burned down we were in fourth grade so and there's no there's no nothing about all of us together like there's no toy there's no blanket there's no photo there's no it just doesn't exist\nSo like three years ago me and my father's sister em I'm Joan took the only photo we have each other like of all four of us in one room which is sort of wild so right about her\nAnd I read about that um because\nHe is president Everytime I show up with other people that like if she can leave us and it feels like anybody could leave and that you know I've had a hard this has been like a heart for days and the other day I woke up and I just wanted a mother you know it's like angry at her for the first time in a long time but you can I just wanted to know that there was a place I Love live to and like\nShe's gone she is she's she's alive but wasn't a mother [noise]\nUm and then I write out being gay and like when does it mean to be gay and then move man like how do I think about this idea of not coming out of the closet coming out of the quiet out which is a treat than I did a long time ago that I turned into an essay\nIt wasn't that I didn't believe in God but that I Believe in storm more\nStolen from the X. men men seem somewhat more related to me than a Jesus died for my sins and rose again I went to church because I had to church was about more than God to me or whether it was not about guys so much as it was about the other things it was the change the rhythm of blackness in one room all of us focusing\nOn something other than a are paying for a moment\nAccent for relief from a power greater than our own able to cry\nAnd dance and sing and laugh at them and feel free\nIt was this feeling of freedom that I most remember from church that's what he taught me\nThat that could be moments in this world when black people could come together and feel and unguarded joy when we could be given and we could share a happiness they could take us through the next week until we needed the next dose next Sunday\nBut my father to him church was holy he often credits his recovery from drug addiction as being possible only because of his relationship with God\nA power greater than himself to even thought that he might have been called to be a preacher one of the memories that I'll never forgives watching him preach about Jesus is\nCrowned with on on the calls but for me ... was a place I went because I had to go [laughter]\nI Will say this is only the second time I've heard somebody else where you from the book [laughter] and I'm I'm like I like that you know it's funny [laughter]\nUh [laughter] um and that type of this call I was raised by magic right yeah\nWell I just want I just want to see a a a find all of that there's not enough time that we can have some great conversation about all of that and we will about all of it um I I Do want to I I Do want to um include this it really goes along with you were talking about the second goal but freedom is not only the absence of oppression\nBuddy there's also the presence of justice and joy\nWe have never seen a world of equity justice enjoy we're trying to create something altogether new and it is impossible to create something new in the absence of how I Would even go as far as to say that many would decry hope\nThe loudest could eventually be the most hopeful among because I Know I I think that a little differently but many who decry it the most\nCan be the most hopeful among us\nThey are doing the work of whole deconstructing our current realities but they are afraid that they may feel so they hesitate to bill or they fear that the world won't get done what would you say what we what were you trying to say you in a specific point\nTwo things one is about the so that's after I was raised our magic I'm I'm obsessed with\nI was trying to think about where did I learn good and bad and like good and evil and it was in church it was like it was storm it was like the X. men told me so much and\nWhen I think about story if you remember the cartoons that storm would like show up first she like rather than as a life that you know the lightning bolts rain something and then she would like always step back a little bit and like the team that come in and I learned so much about like what do they mean to have power and restraint like what do they mean to be a part of a team of all great people like\nStorm taught me all those I write about um I write about Mario car is that if you\nIt's a number one the less power ups you get like you just don't need the help we're close to the number one and like the for the young ... twelve you'll get everything you can get you know it's like a lightning bolt I read I read shell agreed say like you can at all and like that taught me about like well I what you get when you need and like\nSo right about that like this idea of like we learn these things in many places and those are all valid and like church taught me some things that taught me to sort of freedom enjoy it didn't teach me good and evil I learned that stuff much later from church but like storm taught me so much\nAnd the second piece this idea of sort of the people who are afraid to open and like what that looks like\nIs that you didn't hear people asking all the time I wasn't as being the right and left in terms of messaging wiser right so good at messaging and it's not the right is actually good at messaging is it the right to have a different a different job is that\nThe right is engaged and recall in memory they're trying to take us back and they're using like nostalgic images to like reinforce his idea that we've already survive once before\nWith the left we're always engage them make believe like everything we want and something we never seen before so when you think about like\nFree health care you've never seen that like the best you can do is make it up for the person next to you like you've never seen it before my bar as always if I Can't explain it to my aunt and it doesn't work\nAnd not the amicus dumb because she is not but she's not sitting in front of the TV all day so like when I'm Talking to her about Cavanaugh I'm not entering from a space of roe v way because like she just is it ... like she believes in a woman's right to choose a row the way it is not the place for me to get her there so\nWhen I call on me I'm like I mean you know they hide in the papers he like they had the papers I'm like are they [laughter]\nBecause [laughter] the entrance right and like I can get her and she's like they had to pay was around like they can either [laughter] and I'm like and they trying to take away people's rights that you see things and they take that and I'm like yeah I think [laughter] but like I say that because\nLike so much of this work is like how do we create interested in the ... people and like how do we help them think about a world that just isn't this one of them but a world that they deserve so what does it mean to say that people\nLike you know should every kid like learn how to read and write and it's like people were like yeah since I went to school looked like where every kid can read and write and it's like [noise]\nLike getting people to start to like exercise those muscles of imagination that is all that we are engaged in on the left if I'd say there's anything that we sort of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inforum from The Commonwealth Club", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
