{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Now transportation the previous speaker brought up transportation to ensure that these opportunities that my daughter really wants to ensure everybody has access to there are some considerations\nFor students who might live in the bay view or other neighborhoods that are far from law I Hope that the district would consider a transportation plan flexible enough\nTo allow not only to get to and from school for those who might need it but also to allow the students who live geographically far to engage in the after school program the after school life that is one of the beautiful things that we laugh about law\nAlso not only for students but for families to be able to come back to school right to engage in all of the parent opportunities that there are as well how can we facilitate\nAnd only make it for certain things depending on their schedule but we take responsibility as a district to support that access as well [noise] finally\nWe also need to support the culture chefs that are necessary as many that we've heard tonight so it's not a question of any student being considered and other who needs to fit in but the average student feels that they belong\nThat the only bad middle school students who return as low graduates say ... is a great place for us we are low [noise]\n\nMy name is Julia Roberts told me and I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the San Francisco families human um and I want to point out that even though some of the comments with her tonight have been very offensive to students and families there sanitized version of what is being said right now in ... list serves\nIt's explicitly racist to assume that black and Latino students will not exceed at Lowell they have been they are they will continue to [noise]\nIt's also offensive to assume that within twenty square of two thousand seven hundred students that there's only room for the forty nine black students that are there now if there's not enough room in the bans expand the band\nAnd I also want to point out there's nothing stopping level from supporting students that are there now and continue to support students here with them and supporting students right now it's having access to the school [noise]\nNothing stopping little from becoming from being a meat grinder and I know there are folks with ... are working to make sure that it's a more inclusive environment [noise]\n[noise] [noise] I feel like the the conversations that we have in San Francisco take me back to listening to the this American Life the problem we all live with which focused on segregation\nAnd in a call ... pulls out sound from a board meeting a school board meeting in Ferguson where Michael Brown was shot and killed and Darren Wilson was not convicted for his murder [noise]\nAnd their school district had been on food into another district so they accidentally integrated the schools and to hear the white parents comments about that situation and to share the same kinds of comments accurate echoed in San Francisco school board meetings is deeply disheartening\nSo an echo that this um this modest correction as an error that would otherwise exclude students from Willie Brown from having access to a peak courses at Lowell\nI'm absolutely needs to be corrected and it's I feel like it's just the beginning of the conversation it's deeply sad to hear that families are here in opposition thank you\n[noise]\n\nFor a president ... members a super termed a river novel tells him to marry her as the vice president I'm representative and do very Supreme there's pros and brown is out of town\n... quicker oh arduous herder rakes from\nAmount maybe not resemble the law graduate speak and it becomes very clear to me that they don't teach ... [laughter] that's for sure I'm a nerd sugars from brings about diversity they're missing\nBecause I met her fruits were some people preconceived notion and it also makes them very comfortable\nAnd secure with themselves to believe that African American students and Latino students are not capable of survivor you know little and achieving in a fairly orderly us we're the only ones are smart enough to do it and I know that probably makes them feel good\nCourse we'll window those of us who have been a sleep all of our lives no that's not the case we know the issue is always with opportunity sure we certainly support\nThe Bush which ... district and staff are recommendations to change what happens that LOL and who gets than\nI Do want to just give you a couple of disjointed comments that will just make me feel better one is uh I didn't have the privilege of going to school high school and elementary and San Francisco I went in Los Angeles no booze so I'm a giants fan\nSince Nineteen fifty one but ah\nAnd and I'm In pain because the Dodgers Megan World Series but let me just say to you and if it's a boom in Boston I really die with San Francisco [noise] San Francisco a lead Boston New roads were there and dismiss\nThat we are diverse and we are inclusive and better just not the case and the people of color who live here and on those are those who move here more rich to be the case\nThat we're just not as diverse as we'd like to believe we're not as encouraging for example for ... what students are called ... and and we certainly don't have safety nets and the kind of things that we need\nA oh and one of those things are blew my mind when I was out here our ... good schools in a letter with Robert thousand I'm Sorry I Am\nYes sir I'm Sorry thank you [noise]\n\nOkay uh ... uh comments from members return or\nUm so I just want to say a couple of things I'm I'm strongly in support of this policy uh I [laughter]\nComing into this meeting tonight sort of thought well this is this is a small piece of the larger problem that we really do have to address was looking at at all of 'em olive oil and missions um but after hearing some of these comments and I thought\nYou know we we absolutely have to do this this is about black students like let's just be let's let's be very clear about that this is about black students which are not going to law in numbers that near that get anywhere near their numbers in the district\nWillie Brown is the middle school that has the largest percentage of black students have any metal school by far in this school district and so if we want to chew advantage black students which I think this board has been very very clear that we absolutely do than a policy like this one makes sense\nAnd I also want to point out that this policy says that ah the students that would receive banned three qualification to law have to meet the minimum ... academic criteria citizen of the house this is not about giving students who aren't prepared a leg up if they are prepared\nTo meet the ... the band three criteria and they would be prepared at at at any school in in this a distinct so um some of these objections just do not seem well taken to me so all that said I'm I'm happy to be in support of this policy and I'm looking forward to working with the port on\nI'm looking at the lower admissions policy in a bigger way\nFrom ... [laughter] I'm thank you to everyone who came out um\n[noise] so I'm I'm fully supportive of this policy um there's there's a couple of reasons why um [noise] you know the first thing is that if we are in a position where saying it any of our schools that some of our kids can't be successful um then we got a problem and the problem is not with\nWho are qualified to be there um the problem with that is with us then um we have to be able to ensure that all of our students can be successful and we should never be saying that these kids can't make if they're if they're not prepared to be there this is a public school system\nAnd the fact that they would we would be saying that or people would be saying I think is very problematic the other thing to remember that Dan to ban three is not a lower standard um these these are high standards um in fact if you look at what the University of California systems doing if you look at what colleges are doing all over the country this is the direction that they're going it more\nHolistic admissions looking at more factors in just test scores and GPA um we know that um and and not only that but at the University of California actually has a local admissions policy where if you're on the top nine percent of your high school that you are guaranteed to get into a ... or you see\nAnd so these types of policies where you actually ensure more accessibility\nWhere you ensure more diversity where you ensure more opportunity is becoming the standard in\nThe ... at the college level um so the fact that we would somehow be saying that we're lowering standards when in fact colleges do that as a higher standard when you're looking at a greater set of factors and your intentionally focusing on diversity so I actually think it's somebody mentioned that maybe we should have a larger ban two and three maybe we should be looking at that\nAt the middle school level at the elementary school level to help them uh be successful at any high school but in particular mark winning offered a\nProposal for ... instituting a summer bridge program you know several years ago we did is\nSo tonight is really about Enron Lynch a policy we still need to have a more robust discussion about supports for students in the middle grades in elementary school for students success and given the policy change what additional resources might be\nA necessary and so I appreciate that the conflict feedback from both in terms of what they would recommend in terms of those concrete support\nBut I I just wanted to mention and\nLongtime a teacher at law is now retired Joanne Stuart when I mentioned this policy she said I wanted to do those kids I Want it to the kids don't worry about in middle school and I think we had the same sentiment from Marshall tonight so I really do hope\nThose understand that we are trying to make them look nice stronger by being more inclusive and more diverse I Will be supporting the policy thank you [noise]\nStart from others\nI just wanted to take a moment to address I don't assume positive intent and own a soon that um the those have you came here tonight to say just slow down and slow the policy down and\nSend the policy back [noise] that you cut your attempting to come from a positive place but I Want to just take a moment to read the words of Martin Luther king this is from fifty five years ago from his letter from Birmingham jail [noise]\nWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed frankly I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed in the view of those who have not\nWho have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation for years now I've heard the word weight\nIt rings in the ear of every negro with piercing familiarity this weight has almost always Mitt never we must come to see with one of our distinguish jurists that justice to last too long delayed is justice denied\n[noise]\nBasically falling out the gang [laughter]\nI Do want to appreciate a everyone that came out the speaking public comment I notice is a very passionate and I'm sure that many people are passionate about [noise]\nI wanted to follow up on a one of the things that are commissioner Hany mentioned about university is moving toward a policy that\nOh we are accepting their permit here is actually was also done in Texas\nOr the University of Texas at Austin and miss the top six percent of students from across the state and imagine Texas may progressive um and so if you're looking for\nResearch based on this is just like this if you do a super simple Google Search you'll you'll find plenty or so\nI Want to be labor the comments I think that my colleagues spoke well for me to not and so there's no other questions broke hobo pleased with Cosco\n\nChairman were voting on both policies to five winter one student's Simon and Gwen twenty point when little admissions Chris\nI'm listening into yes thank you Mr Murray yes Mr Hany yes documentary on the high missing yes Mr Sanchez yes Mr Watson\n\n\n\n... section of public comment on general manners judo a masters\nOr pleased about the public comment as an opportunity for the board to hear from the community or matters within the ... we actually she refrain from using employee a student names\nIf you have a complaint about district employee you may submitted to the employee a supervisor in accordance with district policies that was a reminder for rules of California law do not allow us to respond to comments or attempt to answer questions during public ...\nIf appropriate the superintendent ... acts staff will follow with speakers\n\nSo if you are if you would like to leave this could probably otherwise we will convince the public comment\n\nLost your name is here and then they'll leave a let's see so I have a Ricardo Lopez and when I when I when I asked you noticed we make your way to the podium\n\nDaniel how our\nTim since ...\nThan a leader Fleischer\nFisher\nStudy my name's Ricardo lupus I'm just gonna stop for me because I'm getting nervous when I'm Talking from the body so\nA member of the loop as you see it as the ... are you up to get me a better when they were like high school\nMy name is ... the law says and then he had to like you know\nI'm I'm I applied for my son to go to high school in San Francisco and it's a ... ... I'm a seem\nPretty avenue of San Francisco in the ... say they'll send you a daily city he seemed barely beyond the trumpet or I mean you hope ... us they're going to go\nUm my son is in special ed and he's got to stick and a two years ago we moved to Daley's city but he had always we see that chance it to be able to go to school here in San Francisco\nOr say you're almost like in San Francisco the name was turning up again you're back here in San Francisco and see the living room temperature is the\nE your if they see [noise] see\nOne name was I mean when they see me I suppose it then again I don't see how do you I thought well he is the you know the name was ... why don't you go to see the UC Berkeley a better\nBudget butler new or see that those are the numbers get their loads of\nUm ...\nMe and my wife what he has San Francisco and I'm not we have about youngest son who has received on the ... or does it to go to school here in San Francisco\nBut if we take away stone to daily CD we won't be able to afford to pay for I was taught at school who is going to Berkeley because why nobody will have to clean up what jobs\nSolicited yeah you're not going through that I see on this they don't ... your take on the western doctor you're sick\nThat you know does he get out of high school kid psychotic in San Francisco\nCity out but I mean so if you see in the legal and um\nSo I Want you to conceded to uh give my son that tax fear again and I know he's not going to be adult June\nAnd I really don't know what's gonna happen did he must be a high school but if he can go to high school here in San Francisco and leave it he could get back to graduate from high school in San Francisco don't need something to us what you're gonna think\nThank you [laughter] can I could uh please let him know we were we have somebody from a PC or they would go\nDaniel Howard Simpson for\nA miss Fisher\n\nMy cards actually for the accountability item which I think is G right or eight and I haven't here for ... public comments do you\nOkay why are already other speakers here if not we'll move on or you go ahead\n[noise]\nGood evening my name is Tim sue for it and I'm here to just address what ... is particular comment\nUm my wife and I have two children and I said if you're a state and we've been done everything from beyond the PTA board to running auction shares to fundraising volunteering in our in two very good but obviously under funded schools because they seem to all be underfunded in California\nUm it is a privilege that I can cause and both my sense is office when leaks who will be presenting this data with me and the privilege of having my principal says here that we can on now for all this good data\n\nSo we want to begin with a first thing that all the data that we are going to present tonight is over three years [noise] so are we back in mind what I Would like to do is show you that she a demographic trained\nAt San Francisco Unified School district approximately ... we have had fifty three thousand students enrolled in the district\nAnd when you look at the demographics vote at through ethnicity and a program lens what we find is that the decline to state um has started to increase more than two percent\nGate the other uh decreases or increases way less than a two percent but that has been a significant increase of more than two percent when nine point two percent of San Francisco's students are with the decline to state um ethnic um background\nAnd interesting fact is that we have more than thirty five hundred students in San Francisco enrolled in chalk this cause and are a pre gay and really meant has increased up to Fifteen for the students this uh last year\n...\nI'm going to turn to Dr Stevens to present the stack yearly and Matt data\n\nOr commissioners what we're looking at as a representation of the aggregate scores on us back for a variety of of ethnicities across the district so to further to the left you'll see that the district to aggregate ... score has risen by from fifty three and fifty four to fifty five percentage points meeting proficiency [noise]\nAre you also see that for some demographic categories there's been a small but steady increase over the last three years um and then a a more significantly also noticed that for some ethnic groups you'll see that or the performance has remained steady or declined\nI'm so this represents in effect a widening of the treatment gap by only a few percentage points but it is still a widening of that gap\nOh you'll notice over to the left in the orange a bar or that we've seen a a different rates of improvements by level or we've experienced almost a three percent increase or for elementary age students taking us back\nA relatively modest growth at the middle school level and approximately a five and a half percent dip at the high school level of this represents only our eleventh grade test takers they're the only group required to take the U.S back each year\nAnd then for African American students the only game that we've seen has been at the elementary level we've seen losses of small losses but still losses middle school and high school level\n[noise] [noise]\nThis ah this is a corresponding sort of results for mathematics and we also see that at the district level we've achieved fifty percent or a again a this was equal to the performance two years ago [noise]\nUm this still has a ten percentage points higher than our largest urban counterpart in San Francisco or you can see there than the demographic breakdown um\nThis thing in this year's results are over on the right hand side another one of the interesting facts about the Sears performance or cohorts with students moving from the sixth or seventh grade made the single largest sort of increases on the U.S back a math proficiency rates compared to other grades are in the district\nUm these increases are also um court or out pacing the corresponding increases at the state level\nOr so to the extent that we're seeing that are entering into middle school and all of the supports that weeping and been putting into middle school makes a difference here is we're showing up\n\nI'm looking at bright spots within the district that many I could almost need each and every school in a talking about some big bright spots this is the fourth year that we have seen the aspect being administered and if you look at the ... consecutive up would trend\nIn fourteen Fifteen to Seventeen Eighteen receipt in schools in English language arts and ... schools\nIn math that have shown an upward trend for or for yours [noise] um and other interesting factors if you look at the California school dash boards criteria for performance\nThe will drank forty percent of schools or fought the schools as um high to very high status\nIn performance in both gone daddy as yearly and Matt\nSo again the schools are\nHigh to very high content that is a within these schools nine are that are nine schools that have a proficiency of eight of above Seventy five percent in both gone daddy as which means Seventy five percent of the students a meeting or exceeding grade level standards\n\nOr how do we compare to other districts across California these large urban districts across California or by lodge I mean having more than fifty thousand students enrolled\nAnd you can see that we are the only one that has maintained at the above fifty percent proficiency rates in both math and English language arts over the last three years however when we take the same districts and we tried to look at them for African American students\nWe had the second lowest in performance\n[noise] eat every designations as if us these e as the designation rate has been moving slightly a void ... however the state treat is two percent student higher than our rates\nAnd the gap in that he designation rates between Asian and Latino students is increasing\nThat are also a as you can see some bright spots in schools where you can or the district street that red daddy designation rate was uh twenty five percent or more um\nAcross that and the e as students um be designation and eight of those schools are listed above along with him but emphasis that he designation grades\n[noise] I'm going to turn it over now to this than to send to talk about the high school indicate that\nEvening commissioners thank you return\nPleasure to present with you um when we start talking about high school measures that we want to first look at high school reading this as an opener and if you'll remember high school reading this is something that we developed with other core districts and the indicators of high school reading this which are on the right side of the five or ... if\nThan two point five or above they have no these are efforts in English language arts or mathematics they have a daily attendance rates of Ninety six percent and they were not suspended in during the school year\nThe good news that we see with the citizen twenty Fifteen sixteen we saw one thousand eight hundred and Thirteen students come out of eighth grade that met these high school readiness criteria\nYou also remember that simultaneously we have developed on tracking off track measures for our students and of that one thousand eight hundred and Thirteen students NSF USC that met the criterion Fifteen sixteen\nI'm we now see the eighty three percent of those students are on track to graduate this year [noise]\nAnother measure that we looked at is the cohort graduation rate\nAnd we the stages release the most recent graduation rate for twenty sixteen\nSeventeen should be noted that this year the state adjusted the Cold War graduation rate calculation which resulted in not only our district and the other districts and the states um and and throughout the state or drop from about one to three percent\nIt was a slight adjustment and the calculation\nI'm so any increases that we uh we would know this year that factor should be considered\nI'm as if you see the sixteen Seventeen cohort graduation rate was eighty four points four percent\nThe really good news that we should celebrate as a district\nThat are African American graduation rate continued on the upward trajectory even with the adjustment um with the remember the one to three percent adjustment and the African American graduation rate was Seventy seven percent which is continuing to narrow the gap\n\nThank you so much I'm Kevin is not your today but he has already presented this previously a this is the chronic absenteeism and suspension rates which you can see\nGoing up [noise] um [noise] and", "show_name": "Inforum from The Commonwealth Club", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco",
