[noise]\nWell how can I say this I mean our beaches are not California beaches you have to imagine a beach full of rocks there's lots of reckoning seaweed is seaweed all over nasty biting flies and of course a lot of greenery\nLots of of a fresh seaweed so we're walking into this a space and\nOur feet to sort of stopping into this a knee deep in in in the rock name seaweed and then we find this patch of green intuitively you're drawn to it we go there we snap this ah this greenery\nAnd it you know cracks like when you when you cut into a watermelon and we bite into it it looks like a ... a little thicker than a child and then the flavor hits us and it was a flavor of coriander\nAnd again going back Fifteen Years ago coriander to you guys hear you're such a diverse community and and you know you have Mexican nearby coriander probably all of your cilantro as your caller here\nThat's probably a common place but Fifteen Years ago there was one of the most exotic things in Denmark it really was it's hard to imagine but it it truly truly was you just never got it and most people if they had they thought it was like soapy no don't give me that if these exotic thing\nAnd certainly we were in the cold north\nAnd you know up a few months before that it was all beats and onions and suddenly we're chasing coriander from a beach plan\nAnd it was a pivotal moment in which it was like you know wow what else is there that was sort of thinking and then we really went full on and we wanted everything and we were so enthusiastic because nobody ever told us about this as a cook including her school you learn techniques of sorts\nThat type of clothing their cooking and so we discovered you know you can actually each trees beyond the sap or if you how's the pine cones in their first season they can be so delicious they can have the same picture as a toughie as a colonel toffee\nYou can similar some of them and sugar and they become these perfect candies\nYou can solve some of them and they turn into our lives\nBut the tastes like forest it was like a complete revelation for us this wilderness\nWithout a force quickly we started also wanting to have\nThis wilderness er into the next season and into the next season and and we were specifically looking for having it in the winter uh so we could\nSpice up the beats something wouldn't it be nice to have slices of salted a pine cone without beets\nUm and then we started dabbling into a\n... at first called preservation or ... I think we call it the pickling cuisine at first I liked to have labels for things and so that label I think we call it first was pickling and then of course as we dabble interred we started reading and reading more and more and you start investigating you figure out wow\nThere's a a a whole world is ... out there um there's people doing it in very sophisticated ways and have been doing it so for centuries we started to learn from everyone we started to travel or and it grew and grew and grew and grew in us until a I'm a very certain\nMoment where we were playing around with sauerkraut I don't know if you have cemented anything but sauerkraut it's kinda like the first level of a of a\nA fermentation I mean it's an every single for imitation book that's already out there it's the one thing that most people know\nOr that's fermented cabbage\nAnd so as we are dabbling into this we started reading about the science of affirmative action actually which proved to be incredibly useful for us\nBecause then we could figure out what what is actually that goes on and then you didn't you stopped seeing ingredients you just saw a component of it and they realize that can take the salt and I can put other things into it and and the lactic acid fermentation will happen\nAnd so we did that with the goose ferries\nAnd um one day or one of the cooks are it's a a longest standing cook in the kitchen he's been with us for eleven years\nAnd he comes to me any ... presents me this or ... or the spoon with is murky liquid in and he says taste issues and you know it's like most things or if I meant it it's not really Instagram friendly I'm [laughter]\n... world renowned chef and co owner of now my in Copenhagen and David filter director thing now my fermentation lap whose new book is the ... guide to fermentation on Dina series featuring creative license from the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nBeing that it's often the Alamo as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\n[noise] and so uh so we decided to build a lab and at first it was a old shipping containers are bought cheap and we went to a key and bought the second cheapest a kitchen and ikea um\nAnd we just built it together and and we read some books and suddenly we had this lab a but it was a it was a big moment where we said we have a kitchen we're going to take the idea of ... out of the kitchen and make its in its own complete\nSection with his own team and they do nothing but just that we need to exhilarated here and of course doing that so in doing so if you have the right people doing it it will make things explode\nAnd since then it's only gone up a for us and that ... leaves me with the idea of this book here because\nI'm\nAs we're developing all this as this was becoming really truly the DNA of who we who we are as a restaurant\nIt is for us today are completely impossible to have a flavor DOMA in any season and not have anything fermented it's much more easy not having anything forged in it a fermentation heavy clips forging a long time ago for us\nThe main pillar um and\nI actually believe in this quite a lot that this is a way to make a cooking easier or it is for us it has fueled or creativity again I always say that ah before um fermentation we had like a handful of legos\nWhen the fermentation came into a world we had a basket full and all these leg goes up to us to and I'll learn how to play with them and figure out how to build with him but truly um it is or something that is transformed or a restaurant\nUm and we have more than a hundred different things that we have developed a in in the over the years\nThey won't be recipe that for instance another sauerkraut recipient is what I'm because we wanted to try to be true to to what a restaurant is and we also for the first I Want to do a book that people could actually use at home or to open up and cook from\nUm as we're planning this book it dawned on me that had never ever ever heard anyone say hey a coup that dish from your from one of your last book [noise]\nOne has a finger up here [laughter] which one [laughter]\nWell I'm a crazy [laughter]\nUm yeah so so um [noise] so that has now become this book and and as you will see there's a as you can see in the book there is a different name than myself or on the cover and ah it's ah Mr David Silber he's from\nCanada or the Canadian over here [laughter]\nUm and\nUm and he's going to come up here on on the stage and who's going to introduce some more about what is that we do because he is a specialist and ah I'm not a specialist in the way that he is a specialist he is truly truly truly\nSpecialist in this field and ... I Am just a little insect uh in comparison to to what he knows\nIt is also a the first time the ... ah is stepping onto the stage so to speak on this journey here he is in our kitchen normally a big part of our kitchen but\nNow he's stepping onto the stage or this is the third event that we do on a tour here um but um it is still only the first time that he's really trying and so please be can be very kind to him when he comes\nWhen it comes on stage for now and ah and also a take pictures of him because I think you're going to be hearing a lot from David ... in the future if he's going to be one of the greatest I don't believe that to please welcome the David Silver [noise]\nSo [noise]\nWhy do we prevent oh we from it because the juicy part of a friend for so much better when it's ... with crunchy sauerkraut we prevent because a cold effervescent kombucha is incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day we prevent because me so soup\nWarns our souls and the winter we for men because ... cheese right Mina Gratz luxurious champagne and crunchy sourdough bread or all\nDelicious\nNow all these things and hundreds more are white people from it today but if we really want to get to the crux of the matter we have to go back in time and ask why people started fermenting in the first place\n[noise] now\nPre history human beings have strive to make food last in our age in days as hunter gatherers a thousand calories of energy spent looking for food in the field would yield about a thousand calories a food upon a return to cap it was actually quite hard work to stay alive\nSo it's no wonder then that about ten thousand years ago all over the world independently of each other cultures began to make the switch to agriculture\nThe domestication of different crops like rice Mays soybeans barley weep sorghum\nFuels humanity like forging number could these were calorie protein nutrient rich plants that we teams intended to [noise]\nWas the fact that the crops that we were growing or seller of all\nThese were seeds impulses and grains that we can dry in store for use it a later date when nutrition was more scarce in effect we finally found a way to make food last we could make caloric surpluses but not all foods can be treated this way\nWhat about leafy greens or fruits and vegetables or the meats and milk of the animals we hunted are herded how can we keep those foods from going off\nIf agriculture revolutionized human survival then fermentation stepped up\nTo be the next step in that revolution we discovered that\nA bit of unseen help and some salt one a long way to keeping those foods around longer\nBit by bit accident by accident our ancestors discovered that they could actually kind of steer these processes they could\nHave some modicum of control over them and make the things they wanted to make turn grape juice into why take fish from the ocean turn that into their sauce turn cabbage is into Kim chi\nFermentation provided humans with the means to hold onto foods that would undeniably spoil if I'm treated\nNow our scientific understanding of fermentation has increased exponentially in recent history the entire field of microbiology is only been around for a bit more than a hundred years meanwhile fermentation has been serving mankind for millennia and millennia go\nWe can never really know what was going on in the minds of our ancestors but we know that when they tasted about a boiling\nOr bubbling juice or or moldy beings they enjoyed it and we know that because we still do it today is the ferment are living artifacts these are processes that echo through time\nThey're handed down from generation to generation through hands both human and microbial\nUnbeknown store ancestors they were ... with the unseen agency fermentation microbes and to this day we still are\nSo it begs the question\nWhat actually is happening in that crop of plant matter as it's transformed in your kitchen counter over the course of weeks you appear in and see a change well it varies from protest to process but the gist of it is this microbes microorganisms works to break down organic matter in doing so they garner useful chemical energy\nTo fuel their own life cycles and multiply and then leave something else behind in the process the something else gets left behind is often an exclusionary chemical [noise] think about it lactic acid bacteria citric acid by certain fun guy or alcohol by these these are chemicals\nThat have been designed to blindly by evolution to eke out the competition and make these environments safe for the microbes to produce them or by the microbes that produce them in them alone or so they think\nThe hopes that maybe some view will\nCatch that kind of magic spark and you know tell us about it and that will spur us on even more\nThat's the beauty of\nOf this everything we've done in the restaurant has always been in the pursuit of flavor we can't stress that enough\nThat these things will completely change the way you cook\nBattle in tights you to keep doing it and get you hooked try just a couple of recipes and you want to do more\nThey sent me now KLW series featuring artists and thinkers spoken at the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nToday's guests are David sapping world renowned chef and co owner of now my in Copenhagen I'm David shelter director of that now my fermentation Rob\n... new book is now my guide to fermentation [noise]\nBeing as often as annabelle as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\nNow us telling you all this might just seemed like another but on the bandwagon yes that whole foods pile is already there\nIt ... it is fair to say that fermentation is trendy than ever but I don't think at all it's fair to talk about something that's been so essential to human existence for so long is experiencing a trend and that's because I really\nTruly believe that fermentation today is experiencing an understanding\nI guess that it might seem scary but we try and guide you through it in this book we try and explain the principles because the principals are far more important than one hundred and one recipes for sauerkraut\nThe principles will lead you for its discoveries even your own home kitchens\nEven once you get that far it's not enough to just make these events and have them around we want you to actually put them to good use something that she has and I definitely discuss when we were planning this book is the fact that most fermentation books out there will give you one hundred and one recipe\nHow do you incorporate this magical amazing thing into your everyday life\nSo we guide you through it again just giving you very off the coast recipes of what we do when we take for men's home from a well\nThat's the beauty of it\nAnd I uh for me though I Would say if you're going to put this into use in a ... I mean you really showed\nUm\nI'd like to say that for him and for many fermenting people that some of the coolest people in the world [noise]\nI mean [noise]\nBeing a mentor that something\nIt is it is a big community it's a ... and it's a community of people that share I mean that's it's pretty amazing\nAnd it's like really ultra like or if you think those are ... with the no I don't know sugar in the coffee or a or annoying try talking about ... mother is a\nWay that was for mentors um but they they share everything um and um and in this book we we actually put in everything that we got that we think is special even though that some of them we've been working at for proof\nTen years some of it some of it five years\nUm and if I could hope for one thing is that all of you go and you attack and and you find one thing that you can't live without that you keep producing um some of some of them will be easy and others will be more difficult but say the chicken ... it's one of the best things that I've had\nI mean it's simply perfect\nAs a as a condiment on your kitchen show and the ones who was thought experimented on how to build further can make a spicy one as it's brewing just put a little bit habanero in it and when you have this you know imagine Tabasco that just tastes intensely a roasted chicken\nYou know intensely intensely intensity\nAnd pure clean and then with a hit a spice so that's one that I could would recommend you guys um\nTo start with because I Know that it's it's it's a it's going to be amazing um and one of the things that we're also hoping or actually which is a bit selfish in this sense but um\nYou know the idea that people would go and everybody would start fermenting and there were ... you know not just doing sauerkraut um\nAnd then they would pop up all these ideas on the Internet you know people showing what they were doing and we would learn like that would be something for us with a man these white people in San Francisco [noise]\nThey did this thing my uncle go the Mason\nJars today for breakfast at this coffee ... we actually saw a couple of Chino being served in a Mason jar with a handle on [laughter] that was a that was the first one\nFor me or [laughter]\nBut it's funny when you land in San Francisco you know it's also the first place I've ever seen where it says this is science to the baggage and then there's a yoga room as well as\nYou I think this is the perfect place for fermentation I really [noise]\nI think you guys are going to help\nUs and be better at what we do I'm so pleased ahead and do that and I think it's time for us to um go into a little bit of a Q and a\nUm have you done anything with spend ... was that was spent ... absolutely\nAbsolutely um\nOh yes of course so\nBrew beer and made your warts what's award\nOkay I'll real fast as explain something comes up in the book but\nTo get the sugar out of a grain you have to break down and starts not as the process of molten you take a baby plant you start sprouting it and then it starts producing its own digestive enzymes to break down all the starch and that grant that liberate the sugars and then you roasted to kill the plant in ... sugars\nOnce you have that sweet ... which is ... you put that into water men bring it up slowly to a few successive degrees temperature or an old though sugars leach into your water\nNow that mash can be prevented with these and then you can strain off the liquid get beer\nLeftover matched up wet grains are then totally useful for other things\nWe've made other or we ... them and made vinegars from them um\nBut anywhere you can extract flavor you could totally dry them again and then use them or as like the cracked wheat in a source of soy sauce if you want a you'll you'll start seeing the slots in which they can fit definitely once you once you start getting through the book but there are a lot of places you can do it you can use it rather\n\nThan you know it's not working with ... I Know that's like asking for happening again or I mean\nIt's it's so so so common and it's really a treat when you grow up in Scandinavia because it's such a hearty plant and and it's one of those things that come ah\nIn the very first signs of of real spring and I'm most Danish kids grow up\nWhen they start coming out of the ground that your mother or grandmother will cut them and then you ... they dip and we should be just chew on them actually\nUm but that that's what you do okay [laughter] um but er er\nVinegar is very good with it or it's very good as a quarter you'll which is easy to do um [noise]\nThose are the things that we ... it was too sour\nSweet and then but then we have it as a base for sure or just do like half and half juice like rhubarb is with something else and stuff\nI mean it's it's very traditional and it's the typical for jams and stuff like that um I Love the raw juices a little bit particularly a wind seafood are good when they do if you use them and you can sort of ... seafood in it\nIt's very good that they're welcome\nSo Heather some as Christian and found when she was having a new mom so I'm thinking like how you sound like something comes from Saudi ally during that fermentation fermentation things or just just by something like you just want to do something for people they don't ...\nIt was for people that didn't want to consume alcohol and it basically started almost ten years ago when we first put a juice menu on and a lot of income also because I don't drink very much alcohol myself\nUm [noise] uh and uh\nYou know if you go to restaurants you have this tasting menu and then you also have a wine tasting and and so at first we saw that we did make a mix um whereas a little bit of a juices and wine but\nThen we just made a full menu and they were very simple at first\nIt would be just a cucumber juice with you know a little bit of salt and some men steep in or something like that and that was ten years ago we were a tiny tiny team but today is actually a section of its own yeah like it's a real real a pain in the ass", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Binah", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "25"}
