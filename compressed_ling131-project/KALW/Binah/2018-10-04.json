science and a minor in she kind of studies and he hopes his artwork can shine light on the social issues and living lived experiences of those in his community so were so excited you're all here\nI just want to start up by walking through the origin of social justice showing academy with Sarah and some of the steps of the process with the group\nSo can you tell us a little bit about yourself\nAnd how you started the economy um I've been on ... for my grandmother taught me\nUm I was placed in like intermediate closing classes from like the age of eight till twelve and then I'm Around the age Thirteen seeing the publishing offered me a book deal to teach kids how to sew so I did a book deal than ... followed up with a DVD deal\nThan fabric will it made me an offer to design a fabric collection than simplicity contact me flew me out to New York and I do find the simplicity pattern collection all before the age of Fifteen um\nYou're like a quilting prodigy feeding 'em and your parents are here we get a little shout out\nThank you mom and dad um\nWho took me around core classes and consistently even though I'd get kicked out sometimes um it's still pay for ... classes and Joanne and prom dress designed and drafting patterns in like from a to B from paper piecing to making a wedding ring ... like I I could really just I'm kind of focus and\nKind of do it all I'm not necessarily excellent but I could I was a decent grass and lots of issues but it wasn't until really my senior year in high school\nUm that when Trayvon Martin was murdered it was like he was murdered February twenty six his birthday was February fifth Nineteen Ninety five mine is my birthday is February nineteenth like Ninety five\nSo he was literally two weeks older than me um and when he was murdered I I think it just hit home I've always been you know these things decently socio politically aware but really that murder which just like wow and\nAnd then wants to move and walked often compounded with just other issues it really like I'm getting ready to spend a hundred hours sewing making the double wedding ring quote making a prom dress for a friend\nI didn't think that my son was having like a message wasn't that it was important it's like I still love sewing but if I'm going to be something that I loved regardless needed to have a message bigger than just making something for the love of making it so at that point um\nI was like I didn't renew any simplicity I didn't know any contracts and I was like I'm going to make social justice article those aren't things that have patterns because you make like it's ... it's kind of raw organic Sacco techniques as opposed to buying a pattern and you know creating someone's pattern so my sponsors weren't very happy with me but it was okay\nUm I made the Trayvon Martin quote which is hanging on the wall\nAnd after that like I showed her to churches and just like not not as a you know like when to do something needs to be bigger than this this is the memorial is she's gone but not forgotten we still need to be doing more um the fact\nThat this happened to stand your ground law there's policies we can challenge there's there's lots of action that we can be taken so it was kind of like as a talking peace to spur people to action not to just admire look say oh that's great but in\nBut in the day people were admiring of quote with a dead boy's face on it like it wasn't something that people just wanted to\nYou know people didn't all I Want to make that it wasn't about repeating it was about let's not forget to do something so that was kind of I guess the call and then as I talk to the younger kids they're like well I Want to make a quote about you know sex trafficking or\nThis stuff happening international or you know kids getting human travel from Costa Rica and I'm like well then let's all have a platform to make social justice art but my sponsors were like well we want you to be selling patterned and making stuff for other people do and I'm like well it's OK let's make it free\nThat wasn't something that they weren't necessarily on board with either so talking to my ... the mentors and the people that I knew um they were able to donate fabric and has to be able to have a free\nUm I guess more equitable space to create art not just with the intent of sewing but\nGreat art about issues and things that we were really concerned with and so we had a six week summer program and in that six weeks on the program Brian and won made their first article um and so it was just six weeks Monday through friday all summer and get them\nSo that was the very first social justice selling academy workshop that Brian and won participated in and where was that and how did you even set that up at UC Berkeley on so I graduated and I wrote a grant and they funded it and they were just like a not only can have a grant but you have space so and what year was that\nSummer twenty sixteenth okay so you got money from UC Berkeley where you had gone and just as an as it can you tell us what how old you are when you started at\nBerkeley because I was sixteen right just in case\nWe weren't sure how incredible um okay so you're you graduated from Berkeley\nYou were how old twenty okay Twenty years old you get a grant you have passion and a plan and then how do you actually go about setting up a six week workshop finding people to participate\nReached out to high school instead of program curriculum proposed ... trio gotten partnership with up or down trio funding established groups with like I Need to kids to be there it's selling something you can't start a quote in not decide to come back\nI Need the same demographic to becoming back all the time 'cause it's not a pick it up drop it like kids wouldn't finish another kids quote so I had to work on some partnership upper bound partner with me um UC Berkeley give us a space we had lunch with bart stipend with lots of stuff so\nAnd so maybe it will take a little side\nAside journey into that workshop because we have Brian and one here who participated so I'm Wondering if you can each talk about how you found yourself in the upper down program in what you're sort of initial thoughts reactions were when you have you heard about the court workshop that you'd be participating in it\nUm well basically up around program they gave us a class schedule one on one of the causes of social justice and that's the first time I met Sarah and she basically with a closer relationship with me open up and\nExperience with our fellow social just shoot social justice and how can I express myself in it and with a six weeks or she's I didn't I didn't never so before she taught me how to do everything from scratch and her Robin and from there we made a whole group and in six weeks and you\nLove story was a little bit different they told us to pick our classes like the least\nThe least favorite and the most like the one that you want the most and I ended up doing it backwards and I end up getting put in her class and it was like I I didn't I didn't expect that there'll be is when is it was also like my first time so and so it was cool when\nThen wanted to you could do any of it just makes you ... stitches or small um but after that\nYeah so I think other people I didn't have the block I Do get so they didn't necessarily make blocks they just the other kids in electric class like why can't I make my own quote in the cars I see you an hour a day and I see them like four hours a day mhm [noise]\nSo okay so then where what was the next big leap of a ... a big leap so honestly what that was it was going to be that was going to be at one time summer program I went to Harvard in the fall um it was a grad program but then when I got up there\nI was kind of like a little bored so I started to workshop just just to be clear so you were\nHarvard graduate school a little boring plenty of free time because I didn't get to like I didn't get to see kids in the graduate school it's like old people so um so I was just like I didn't have any access like I didn't have high school friends like you don't go make fun just under grads and people at Harvard like their perception fun was like go to a wine bar and drink or like\nLike knowing when to Six Flags for Halloween like it was just different the east coast versus Berkeley you just really different\nYou're listening to members of the social justice selling academy including founder and executive director Sarah trail corps members Nancy Williams and calling Herod in an artist Brian Rob in San Juan ... an anti em on being at a series featuring creative voices from the Jewish community center of San Francisco [noise]\nTheir eggs edition connecting threads quilts from the social justice telling academy is currently on view at the cat Snyder gallery at the Jewish community Centre\nLocated at thirty two hundred California street in San Francisco through November fourth\nThe social justice showing academy will also be holding a drop in quilting workshop on friday October twelve from three PM on as part of our second friday Shabaab series at the Jaycee CSS\nCheck the J. C. C. S. F. website for more information\nBeing a is also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org\nAnd Harvard it was just it was just it wasn't the same community I had was like OK I Want to do more I should say stuff so um I did workshops that high schools are kind of came up with the a block ... method where instead of having one group of kids for like maybe a hundred hours like maybe we had that in six weeks we had um just for a few hours and you can make a block\nBut then it's like well I didn't have the capacity to teach kids how to in border and it to our workshop because that takes a long time to two hours of spent in the activity including the blocks then became of the idea of having an border he volunteers who like sign up\nAnd then they can take the kids are in a broader and then mail it back so it's still gets the same hand sewn element without 'em like having the kids have to be there for five six hours to learn how to embroider\nSo we just want to make sure so this is like a pretty significant different way to approach\nInitial workshop one student one artist one big quilt hundred hours of work and in this new method new model you're working with kids for just a few hours and maybe at a time and they're making one ... or ...\nAnd then how and then um [noise] how are they attaching it to how are they like\nMaking it oh with scissors based thing blew 'em and then we iron mhm so it's more of the conversation it's more of them understanding of like what do they care about how can they visualize the social justice issue and connected to a visual image it's more about the learning the habit and the workshop and far less about them getting an absolutely amazing our PC ... volunteers are really\nLike the motivating drive for what makes community quilts beautiful okay so how who are the embroidery volunteers where did they come from [noise] there's probably a bunch yeah rate raise your hand if you've ever and boarded fresh yesterday [noise]\nSo it's like they I mean they can come from Instagram they can come from I don't know I don't necessarily know where they come from but they're great\nSo they sign up on your website anyone listening or in this room can go to the SJSU a website and sign up to be a volunteer embroidery volunteer and then what\nHappens then they get their address and I mailed them a block a company with an artist they ... if the kid for example can make a block on this and they they ... out of the street science and they'd like international in bordered on the street sign to really solidify it for\nThey meant it was Oakland home like okay so they can put it if you wouldn't mind could you please and border the word international on the street find that I cut out little things like that\nAt hair or could you add eyes are like any little detail that the kid necessarily couldn't cut out in fabric\nUm and then they mail it they get it then they mail it back to us and then we have a team of volunteers who will take all the blocks that have come back in the mail from like you know the one word shut that we did and then we'll put it into a community quote that'll have twenty quotes and Rosa for by five face featuring all the issues that the kids cared about in a certain group of okay and\n... year I think that this is maybe where you you come in to you\nWhat happens you get a bunch of blocks yeah I'm a piece or um that means I take all of this community box and put 'em together and\nAnd the scientists [laughter] and so\nI sometimes I get an option about I might have opportunity to choose Bach say we did one recently that was primarily focused on black lives matter and so I went through the block selection and made sure that that topic was loud and clear\nUm and then I I'm more of an improv quilter so I don't not you know just big blocks of fabric straight lines and kinda\nJust start selling and so I started to PCs together actually the three of us spend a lot of time initially like laying the blocks out on Nancy studio floor\nTo figure out the order of things and what's going to look best not to have too many faces next to each other so a lot of thought goes into it with the three of us or redo it through texting what do you think about this move that went to the right move this to that and so we do we kind of collaborate through the whole process\nAnd then I piece that together and then I pass it on to Nancy where it gets top quilted and how did you first hear about the social justice Tony academy I to get involved Instagram and I volunteer to embroider and um I I actually didn't really know how to embroider before him like a high\nCould figure it out and uh had a good time to and what was the reason you signed up what sparked you to participate in the young woman in the back of the room with the iPhone is one of my children\nUm after the previous presidential of this current president's election\nI it was a little disheartening and there's only ... [laughter]\nMany letters and phone calls you can make and and I do art to make myself feel better and so this was a great avenue for me to do art and then\nBe an example to my children that hey I'm trying to make the world better for you so thank you sir I'm All right and then Nancy\nYou to then un Sarah and Colleen or having everything on your studio floor and then you're along our culture and I don't think we all know what that is it sounds very exciting can you tell us about it\nSo um you don't have to have long arms to be a long long quilter but I Do have a cartoon with somebody dragging their own um\nBut um ... who's a quilter here it was quilter so quite a few of you for those of you who are not um a quilt consists of a peace or not peace talks but a top it consists of batting which is what makes the quilt give the body and give it some warmth um\nBad in can be anything it can be made of wool it can be an old blanket it can be\nUm part cotton part polyester can be bamboo so it's batting and then it's got a backing so that it's called a quilt sandwich\nSo in prior times you've seen pictures and there may be some pictures up um where there's a quilt and there's a lot of mostly women around the quilt and they it's called a quilting bee and their hands stitching so what they're doing is is is through stitches\nYou know making that quilt sandwich putting it together and adding some strength to it but also just generally putting it together\nUm so that's one way to do it is to handle it and there are some artists that do they still do that\nIt would drive me crazy but I have done it um but it takes a long time um and they do some beautiful work amazing little stitches as you guys you know experienced um\n[noise] so that's one way of doing it another way of doing it is with a domestic machine which is just a regular sewing machine and the machine is stitching you're moving the quilt\nWhich is fine for smaller quilts when you look at a large size quilt\nThan it becomes really an act of strength to and coordination so you have to kind of role would do a little quilting on roll it move it and so if you've ever done that you know how difficult that is\nUm so I've always I've I've been um [noise] I I've tailored um suits I've made wedding dresses I've done a lot of sewing over the years a lot of quilting over the years and I did most of my quilt on a domestic machine um and then I I acquired a a along our which I I got the space\nUm I think at the space first in the long arm second I'm and I'm so now it's a long arm machine which means that is the quilt is on a frame it's on rollers and I moved the machine\nSo it's an industrial sized machines a frame is twelve feet and I moved the machine so it's kind of like painting with red\nSo I'm doing what\nI'm the quilting bee did what people did on on domestic machines but I'm doing on a long arm machine so the closest stable and I'm moving a machine so that's what long arming is\nSo it's a little bit of a story but um so I got involved with um social justice I was I was following the Instagram account and this has been about Eighteen months two years and that long yeah\nDifferent platforms of cool things that will show how issues can be put in art officially and be shown all over the country and I just thought like descent opportunity for me to actually show what I think about what's going on in the world right now\nAnd from my Quil I'm just a piece there that's well when I made the quilt it wasn't that it was pretty recent one that Las Vegas shooting happened\nAnd that kind of like inspired me to actually like want to put that in my ... well at first my coat was originally supposed to be about mental health which is also a big part of my quilt and having my call beep east into different types of issues that's happened\nIn America which kind of made it perfect to just put them altogether\nThis is Tina KLW series featuring artists and thinkers to spoken at the Jewish community center in San Francisco [noise]\nToday's guests are members of the social justice selling academy including founder and executive director Sarah trail\nCorps members Nancy Williams and Colleen Herod and an artist Brian Robin then ... and and yeah there I used to fish and connecting threads quotes from the social justice selling academy\nIs currently on you let the cats Nader gallery at the Jewish community Centre located at thirty two hundred California street in San Francisco through November fourth the social justice showing academy will also be holding a drop in quilting workshop on friday October twelve from three PM on\nAs part of our second friday's Shabaab series at the Jaycee CSS\nChecked Jaycee CSS dot org for more information\nDina is also available as a podcast and you can find it at K. L. W. dot org\n[noise] so you're close is on display in this exhibition is called America the beautiful and um can you describe it for us\nUm that name was kind of ironic [laughter] I'm American a beautiful uh\nWell\nThe more I see you know it's kind of like mind blowing so\nBasically a classroom and had students just looking out the window I'm so it's a classroom with children and and the window pain that's just\nBasically showing what the world's like will has what's been happening in the world outside the school and as a student I've always just looked up we always hear and know about what's been happening in the country and we don't really get to\nPut our own bases on it and actually do something about it and this was a making the ... was my chance of putting that issue in it and\nThe other pieces are on there were some Boston Marathon um bomb and the also the um the one from North Carolina the shooting in the school to\n\nThe world Trade Center nine eleven and yeah\nCan I add to so and quilts amazing one of the things you left off as the classroom setting\nI'm is actually the American flag upside down which is an indication of distress for it's a really moving piece and I just want to make sure and I thought it was amazing I actually got the quilt that quote so I'm really familiar with it now\nThank you [noise] um yeah clearly clearly as to say I'm was started by someone who is I'm just a\nSpecial in the universe I'm a lot of uh Sarah has um a lot of vision certainly a lot of energy um she sees possibilities but the but um most of all\nShe has um a real ... it's it's it's all coming from the heart she has a real desire to provide\nUm opportunities for folks that wouldn't have an opportunity to do something like this um I think you can in talking to um [noise] the students said here you see that this really has changed them and so um\nTo to think about when you look at the exhibit and we have many more quilts and many more blocks and all of that\nUm the impact that ... had on um young people and allowing them both the artistic um\nOur freedom and opportunity but also to have them think deeply about you know the issues that they have and um so this is she she is the heart and soul and I'm the driver of this we all know that very well and I'm anti the Energizer Bunny um but um\nSo I I feel very fortunate to have been part of um disorganization and to have the ability to artistically contribute um to these works of art\nAnd Sarah actually I wanted to ask you about where social justice feeling ketamine is now and where where your vision for it for the future and\nCan you tell us about um I Would definitely have to say it is really possible because of the community who cares because at the end of the day I'm bored we skills are quite pathetic so um I think yes it's fun when kids having a vision but at the end of the day they couldn't even make any court shows about ... volunteers on the border is like\nI mean you put your fingers you bleed it's hard\nUm I Know that in and out stitch but like there's a stitch that's like the blanket stitch and like their stitches that just it's really nice the amount of mentor ship that comes from us you say the amount of people that you know whether they're tired or whether they just you know take off time the amount of people that'll come in and just like it the last workshop we had a workshop at the beach which is East Bay heritage cultures the amount\nOf adults that every kid had their own adult and that are dealt with like a professional like you know in in there\nSoldiers conversation with kids I can help them come great ideas of being able to have a volunteer that can take their kids passion and run with it in a way that you know I'm not able to because I'm not that great it all off things well um I think the community that has come back to these kids in such a humble way and sense of the costs are all beautiful but like the amount of hours\nYes it was a couple of hours and creating all the art with kids but the amount of hours that have gone hind the scenes and peace in the ... one of our that have gone to the border is like the embroidery volunteer like\nCommunity called have hundreds of hours of work because\nI mean including mailing like ... like it's just it's really a community effort and it's a guess use voice is like at the forefront\nBut it's like behind it is really the community that that backs and sports young kids and I think that level of empowerment is really I think critical and crucial in the sense of the quilting world if you go to traditional coach not most not many calls have messages and not many culture all political so I think allowing the court were not only making space for these quotes\nBut the the cultures of themselves making time I'm In Florida is a labor of love and so to have that many volunteers like at this point we have over five hundred volunteers that will take a block\nYou know spend ten Fifteen hours do the block and then mail it back it's like I think that\nThe love the community has four is definitely a way to like keep pushing forward to the in the day if we had a bunch of glued art by kids wouldn't be quotes like [laughter] it really wouldn't like in their messages are great but it's like not ... I don't necessarily have time to be able to teach kids from start to finish southern border I think the amount of time that a border volunteers and community and that's the I mean\nI it's like here's a quote a week like it's it's a lot\nLike everyone puts in a lot of effort in at the end of the day it's off from a leftist used voice shine let these issues shine um I think the community has been doing like just an amazing job in terms of backing that but I think the vision or the future\nI think in one way I really want as you say to disrupt the quote world and the sense of what's allowed who's allowed what's pleased with not pleased if you go to even P. I. Q. S. as much as I'm appreciate that we have a special exhibit in the ... and you tell us what ... the Pacific international quote festival and it's like the largest quote shown California\nThey don't have that an injury spot for youth cultures like at all\nUm so I think the court world and general\nLots of court shows don't have like under Eighteen and it's like at the end of the day regardless of technique kids first quote cannot enter against an artist who's been quilting for fifty years even if it's the same like it's ... it's all adapt okay but like\nI don't know Tina's Raj applicant quote and she's been calling for you know I don't know how long couldn't compete against Brian's first time right after they close I feel in general as much as the quote world might be one in young kids to begin picking up\nIt's not supportive in the sense of it doesn't give access it's like I'm so many court shows even even quote con they had an entry fee for for they had an access point for youth but it was like twenty five dollars for each kid to some of the quote was like a couple of emails they definitely made made space but that was because ... it was like\nWe're going to waive the fee but it's like at the end of the day you can't say yes we want young kids to do it but you're going to have to pay that basically means you need to have a mom or grandma like I was fortunate to have two parents who can pay all the entry fees for me to be able to take classes\nI just think I'm a lot of kids that would have like love for sewing don't have parents willing to spend two hundred bucks and sewing machine and the rotary cut her kid and even if they find a coup machine at a garage sale you still need someone to teach you how to read it need someone to run through you might need oil change my does need to quit\nI guess ... trip to a shop I think at the end the day sewing is really I'm not an equitable but it's just it's an influence fluent craft and flew an art form of not all young people have access to that so I think providing just anyone who wants to learn how to soak in and be able to have a mentor ship pool like Palin that can come and help and support\n'em that means a lot but I think if I could have the vision for as you say would be able to have it like it's like a curriculum where it can be fulltime run in you know urban high schools that can be tailored to the curriculum that values lived experiences um a cool aspect of as you say is the amount of critical I guess really like", "show_name": "Binah", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
