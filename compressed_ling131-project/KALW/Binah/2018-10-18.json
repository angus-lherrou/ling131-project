action exciting ... joined tonight by right girl historian and activists Sarah Marcus ... is the author of girls to different the true story of the right girl revolution a definitive history I mean Ninety funk feminist movement\nIf we want warm welcome from the audience silicon Tacoma and fair market [noise]\n\n\nAlone I think it's becoming\nYeah thank you for coming I'm at the time\nOf your arrest and trial in a two thousand twelve I was at the time I'm traveling around a fair bit talking about right girl and suddenly at my events everybody was really excited to talk about Pussy Riot your feminist punk performance collective uh came as an indicator that the feminist punk\nCould be useful and even influential to people decades later and a half a world away it was an encouraging reminder that when people set out to do something original visionary and prophetic\nAs the radicals in the nineties had the landscape of effects and after effect can never be fully accounted for an advance let alone mapped out you make something you respond to your own time and place\nAnd it travels and we use you never anticipated and I think that's also plainly been true of the work that you've done over the past several years hopefully [laughter]\nAnd I'm In twenty twelve Americans looked at a Pussy Riot and rallied to your defense you're abominable treatment and the courts and in prison was for many Americans are first occasion for paying closer attention to the repressive conditions that held sway in Russia\nAnd things have changed a little since two thousand twelve I'm here in the U.S and so without pain just a little [laughter]\nUm we don't painting overly broad equivalent says between our two countries that it's safe to say that\nWe now in the United states are living under an ultra nationalist ruler with autocratic aspirations however [noise] um [noise] dot dot dot a\nWho openly reviewers your president to gin and seeing [laughter] interests jags were talking about all the credits\nNo real real an aspiring yeah and um and I was just going to say that while the um well and we'll ... we'll get into talking about president is more a as we as we talk but [noise] um well the injustice\nOf our prison system here is generally more about the organizer oppression of black and brown people than it is about show trials for political dissidents as in Russia we are right now seeing a troubling rising the demonization of activist with feminist protesters being characterized as hired guns and angry\nMobs [noise] um so all of which to say that if Pussy Riot began by taking inspiration from us feminists\nI suspect that many of the people in this room tonight\nAre here in hopes of taking inspiration and insight from\n\n\nYou and the people that you collaborate with have been opposing unaccountable cynical truth destroying strongman regime for much longer than we have [noise]\nI usually have some insight\nAnd thoughts on strategy to offer as well as just reflections on where the journey has led\nYou so far anyway much much of this is contained in your galvanizing new book read and riots has your guide to activism and I and I suspect everyone here looks forward to discussing and perhaps whoever's calling right now wants to be on it\nUm we're looking for discussing it with you in person here thank you so much for coming\n[noise]\nSo um\nStart a toward the beginning of things your work uh wasn't widely known especially not in the U.S until you're asked for performing your punk prayer at the cathedral Christ the savior in Moscow which suddenly brought\nInternational attention to Pussy Riot what do you think it was about that action that sparked so much love and support internationally and in the U.S\n[noise] [noise] so my parents and injure is like the mid ... in this way [noise] um [noise] you know I I I don't have a good answer to this question but I like we've we discussed it up is a bit of a in a U.S um\nFor ... they're not the last political prisoners in a Russia [noise]\nBut um [noise] aside from medical ski who doesn't the um got as much attention as we got 'em all the great um\nI think unfortunately ah um people didn't pay much attention to the political prisoners in Russia but um he brought us to conclusion that maybe the deal\nIs a an art and uh that's I'm just making your own life so now knowing people ask me here in America\nLike what what what's a bunch of it too I I think\nAh that the answer is art and that's the reason why our message resonated and people all across the world especially when western world\nBecause you didn't have to know a Russian language you know just to understand what what are we doing because of the picture of all goes to send the flag on their heads where\nI'm surrounded by all this folic um 'cause the drill on things you know it it it's it's pretty straightforward or you know our\nPunk prayer in church like quarter when we were doing this kicks up with\nOur legs and and then just to get her would come to us and ... Luke I can see your underwear do think it's all ... underwear and my mother was really a monster was will be peace but I'm just to get it trying to just ...\nBut um yeah uh so\nAt the time I had no idea how to stick in English like I learned English out later but you know I think that when you use language of ours who don't really have to ... and other languages\nSo it's like you know a puzzles of Christ um they didn't learn many languages but in fact may be um [noise] they learn just one language and it's what's art\n... I'm not comparing\nOurselves [laughter]\n'cause it was the thing and how do you remember Ford trial we would crude cries and exposure nice and then the state of ski and um and then um you know people who were ... just a really just compare themselves with separatists [laughter] no no just clothing [laughter]\nRight that this was actually something that's so striking throughout your new book is that you're you're constantly placing your thoughts and your art in conversation with thinkers from uh from ancient Greece at two up through fruit co up through contemporary Russian dissidents and in fact a\nAnd um their reasoning was pretty clear in ... because I was the one the one person who had lawyers and the access to media\nYou're listening to Russian conceptual artist political activist and founder of the art collective Pussy Riot ...\nWhose new book is read and riot a Pussy Riot guide to activism she's joined in conversation by Sarah markets on Dina a series featuring creative voices from the Jewish community center of San Francisco [noise]\nBeing is also available as a podcast and you can find it at K. A. L. W. dot org [noise]\n[noise] ... really sad story about um women in Russian prisons that for some reason or\nThey are much less supported than men in Russian presence is wrestling women they tend to stay with their husbands and even when they are in prison but it doesn't work other way around um husband a will\nLeave and woman shovel a find ourselves in prison so sometimes her ... parents are still alive I'm going to support her but I'm just little like maybe ten percent of women that get some support from the outside [noise]\nAnd the reason why they end up in a prison there was a it is our were on drugs because we have our own where drugs and you can end up in prison just because you have a few grams of lead in the pocket\nOr or\nDomestic close because we didn't have any specific ... a law against a domestic violence and the Russians will we don't think the domestic violence actually something that you um you should consider seriously\nSo when a woman close to the police and say that I'm I'm about to be beaten ... I was bitten\nThe nursing homes just cause when do you will be killed and then we'll continue and didn't get to murder\nBecause that's something that may or we may be interested in a theater and a ... case that happened to me since the um it became really a\nBig gun pop older because I'm conversation on this woman was recorded um\n[noise] and I mean there are many many cases that just not a vegetarian and then then the recorded says so despite with stick look them they're not that shocking [noise] is that you know when the policemen killed somebody and somebody's making veto of it is just the same sets thirty so she calls\nAnd please come here because I'm about to get killed ... people killed me and the woman police policemen on on the phone she was like oh I was going to define ill defined ... he's a ... and a off for half an hour\nShe's killed right ah and yeah\nSo women end up uh in prisons as they decided to defend themselves right\nThey heard people who'll be big down for dozens of years and um [noise] yeah\nSo after [laughter] after I heard oldest are is a I decided to go on hunger strike and I started a hunger strike was demands\nTo um make a president work they shuttered from six to nine hours a day to eight hours a day and the two\nKey prisoners real the right to complain about what's going on in prison was dealt a cure to be punished for that\nI Know it's quite a daily sick but\n[laughter] if there was nine to ... [noise]\nHow can\nThat I was referred to as like they were quite scared of this hunger strike I was transported from a central Russia to Siberia and for one month nobody's heard of me and I'm not my reality some media the nine lawyers they didn't know where I Am if I if I'm Still alive [laughter]\nBut uh it was actually interesting time for me because of what I learned from that is that you shoot a show she's to the system that wants to wants to press youth you should be loud he should be angry should protest because before\nUm prison system treated me I'm just you know the prison really terribly because I didn't I didn't show my fingers that is why this thought that um week mhm\nI was thinking that I Will not be angry and that's my power in getting angry but the thing is that when somebody has power over you they will not leasing they will not look at your own yeah I'm proud and I'm proud and I'm called it they just didn't work in didn't work so at the point when I started\nTo actively resists they started to respects me ... and they would even do to listings like buy food like order food from the restaurant and bring to me a while and all I was still in prison because they were scared\nThat our right to complain about their prison ... inch idealism point like for the last two months I found myself just lie on the bed a [laughter]\nI was reading through your goal and um I I was around food the grapes and melons [laughter]\nI was like I\nOwe and I'm jeans and a on and on and I wanted to make a giant picture and took it then that that will have everything from ... floor of his crafts\nBecause they were really scared that start complaining and put them up for this position where did you want them to be right because people you were because\nPeople are actually I'm paying attention to what you said and and you were able to draw attention to the conditions there um and so then and that was a power that you that you had\nFrom the moment that you became incarcerated but that you only began to use when you stop trying to follow the rules\nYeah that's that's a big ...\nBut the thing that I should follow the rules and even I other punk and that was arrested I 'cause I was thinking about myself with the rebels Jill I like it's deeply inside us like I should be a good ... ...\nAnd when you know the big men\nPrison warden told view like [noise] your your behaving bad and the ... yeah I'm ... I'm following the law and you don't realize at that point that actually they use the law to oppress cue and\nYou shouldn't care that much about the law they're law in in this instance when it's just\nUm [noise] I\nMean it's the magic seek that they used to kill you basically\nI mean you mentioned anger and um they're angers a lot\nIn the public discussion about politics right now and specifically around feminism and there's\nThere's anger that's coming up but then it's also being used um against feminists saying oh there's angry mobs and we're going to you know things so much for coming out and being this angry mob and now we're going to use this to the right the the right wing is saying you know\nThis is the best thing the Democrats have handed us this fantastic tool to\nLike to win in the midterms because the feminists are being this angry mob and nobody likes that and um I I guess we'll we'll find out in a couple of weeks but how true that is or whether it's just um another attempt to sort of like Seamus back and to not being angry but I've been thinking about this anger thing and I'm curious about it because\n[noise]\n... like anger can expressing anger can as as the story you just told us like get you things and get you um make people take you seriously as someone to be reckoned with 'em\nAnd at the same time there's if I ... I keep wondering like but isn't there a way in which being consumed\nBy angers sort of also shuts you down or or burns you out from the inside and I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the what on\nWhat your experience of anger has and [laughter]\nOh okay um so you should um\nYou should cook your anger in Raceway [noise]\nBecause I'm coming back to that story and it wasn't just anger it was anger\nPlus organizing plus like activists and political recognizing structuring on and I'm a shape preparing infrastructure you've heard this anger to be under the food and to be um articulate it and it's\nReally important to make this public relations effort when you're angry you can kind of just screamed so it's always like you wanna you want to be heard you want to be understood but at the same time we want to express emotions so it's like\nIt's a mixture it's as if it's an act the salad so we\nMaybe two or three big cities but\nWhat is like you know you you know the change is coming when you see that\nPeople even in small potential citizen in countryside disturbed to question whether our part is um corrupt during the day and they started doing it and um minors school teachers um labor unions\nIs all happening and you don't hear about it a lot but yet we were trying to make a list and everything and monitoring what's going on that's fantastic [laughter]\n[noise] this is Tina KLW series featuring artists and thinkers who spoke and at the Jewish community center of San Francisco\nToday's gas is Russian conceptual artist political activist and founder of the art collective Pussy Riot\n... whose new book is read and riot a Pussy Riot guide to activism\nShe joined in conversation by Sarah Marcus\nBean a is also available as a podcast and you can find it at KLW dot org\n[noise] so and the one hand you're involved with these NGOs that you started on the other hand you continue to make art and make music or these ... how do you see the connection between these two zones of action and you're like ... [laughter]\nI mean [laughter] mhm\n[noise] I never separated um when I was I was like sixteen or Seventeen\nI always uh replied and a question like what is more important artist politics out of the it's the same for the art and politics there they're equal and I think just I'm just trying to be\nTruthful at this to myself and um yeah maintain those secured in my life and uh they're interconnected and most of 'em were inspired by um meat is on it and done the\nMusic video boats I'm president Peter ... who's known 'em\nSo yeah he's he's supposed to he's supposed to go after all the criminals in Russia but it turned out some point or that he's the main criminal 'cause he killed people in order to get their property and ... and I'll just get the factories and give give it away to his sons [noise]\nAnd uh so we were writing about it and meters on it and then I was just a ... motion only\n[noise] um heard this thirties and I decided to make this a ... music video where um people are being tortured\nBy um [noise] us in a ... right\nSo so that video is made under the name of the riot and several others many others that we can\nSee online including make America great again as you mentioned um\nBut who who or what is the riot now who's in it or is it a a is it a flowing concept mhm is anybody opposed the right is there a a collective\nStarting anybody starts [laughter] not only six really we can Stein's thing like you know that it's it's not it's not there is no one definition of\nThe threat like you can and should really family resemblance staying and\nYou can start your own proceed right and you can start your own threat and then nobody really in control of of it but [noise] just historically\nI'm among\nPeople who are motivated to nose of doing something under the name of the ... are people who were in the beginning of this group like I\n[noise] I Would really be happy if somebody else would come and view to really accept fall under the name of ... right now but for some reason or it happens that the ...\nMuch either cannot and up through the ... river and the roots of a procedure right they are I'm\nMaking the most I didn't know visible projects but at the same time you know sometimes I or\nMake other fish red and embrace it could come to the country and then the being approached by a group of people mostly women and they said we started a branch of ... and our town and um some testicles it's it was a bit of\nGold from the way the beginning [noise] um we wanted to create a movement that's why we didn't want to show our faces\nAnd ah eventually our faces for um opened when we ended up in court because it was really hard to uh keep masks when you when you're in court because they just take it away from us\nRight [laughter] and he was actually the biggest problem for me at you know the first two weeks if my ... because I was thinking now that much about myself but about a A R identity was revealed [noise]\n'cause I didn't believe actually there's this for a long time I I Believe as a subject maybe we'll spend in prison for months and\nSo my biggest concern was identity and we were mentioning bright new future was lots of uh you know hundreds of women in different cities all around Russia in this colorful masks\nAnd and and so\nOur is part of what you're saying that you think that um\nThat that got a little bit um\nThat to actually come about because at this crucial moment in the in the history of the group suddenly these three members were instead of like it could be anybody could be you you don't know who this is it was like oh actually it's an audio ...\nAnd ... and that that you can put a brace on on the possible proliferation of masked Pussy Riot squads\nIt didn't it actually caused probably you sell some of them I ... I was in prison I was just getting photos from it is included in American cities of um actors who call themselves but you're right and dancing or in\nAnd just be nice and so it happens but obviously the nature of it changed when our dentistry revealed definitely [noise] and um when everyone who to repeal it and well as a matter of fact ah we wanted to um [noise]\nAnd our personal involvement in this project I'm like in a year so the the lot of this project shouldn't be longer than a year and then we\nWe had to be in prison for two years and uh I I couldn't say that go on the ... ... it didn't sound like me trying to and that means being [noise]\nA week or trying to keep from\nWhat I've done which wasn't\n... check the the points so we kept saying that fear is that right and we want to cut out of jail always trying to do it again I think no actually like since it's my face and not the threat\nAnd more some they they started to call me and wash a expert ... which was even worse it's\nLike [laughter]\nLike you know you can be an ex life skills or something but it's just [laughter]\nIt's so cheesy and so terrible in some something from like entertainment mainstream industry so we decided like real ... [laughter]\nSo now is just part of her name sick more Lakers or name [laughter]\n\nWhat's next for you artistically creatively this book has come out um are there more videos more songs in the works how are you buying a completely other direction\n[noise] um I'm I'm you know we we want to work more on music ... and I'm really looking forward to November when a plane to started\nA quiz thinking constantly about new things but I'm not always have time for it because they are just in the river a really busy trying to save his life\nAnd um we didn't think that much about art but since ... healthy I mean almost healthy now he just he went for [noise]\nRegrets\nReally great news from ... bitter is so and the ... and he was treated\nA where anyone in the audience you might not have been following this to August and can you take them from the beginning\nUh so teacher ... who is a number of ... he was poisoned um one month ago a and it happened in Moscow and um [noise]\nTo Cuba was unconscious weekdays um then we moved from a Moscow to lean I'm On the fifth day if he's poisoning and uh he was\nDoing here is for two weeks or he he couldn't recognize his mom from the beginning and then he started to", "show_name": "Binah", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
