{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "You're kind of out of watershed moment that they think this is actually going to be the year when red delicious after ruling the roost since the Nineteen fifties at least gets passed and there is no longer the number one I saw that on the country by gala so here's the gala [noise]\nOkay so yeah so I guess my yeah my point is that I'm at the apple is this incredible entity that has this incredibly wide range and we haven't been asking enough of it it can do a lot of different things\nUm it's almost it's like ... it's almost like if you had Robin Williams on your son will cast and he's all I'm just be the straight man I don't do any voices the apple can do all kinds of voices and it's really entertaining when it does so uh I'll talk a little bit about some of the voices they can do\nIt can be mysterious it can be adorable it can be classy\nIt can be sexy it can be surprising like that things surprise and it can be downright freaky\nI our our ancestors two hundred years ago would have totally known that the apple could be all kinds of different things because they actually depended on it to be all kinds of different things\nRight from the early colonial day is the apple was partnering with the colonists to make life on farms a whole lot sweeter than it would have been otherwise not only was it for fresh fruit which is what we tend to associate it with and for baking\nBut it also gave them a source of fruits throughout the year there were certain apples that would come right in June and July\nAnd there are other apples that you would pick them off the tree in November hard as a rock ... there's no way you could have eaten them there were so sour at the time but you put them in your root cellar for three or four months and took him out in the spring\nAnd they would have just started to mellow up and become really nice and develop some interesting flavors that you wouldn't taste and normally in a fresh apple so they really gave them a source of fruit throughout the year\nBut even more than that they also gave him a way to get drunk throughout the year because of the ah\nThe apple until Corning really came along and was grown in significant quantities and ... and I'm beer came along with that the apple was um site or was the a standard typical for everybody man woman and child it was low alcohol maybe four percent alcohol and\nSafer than the water and that was but everybody drank also another one that people don't think about is er vinegar cider vinegar was really important preservative back in the days pre refrigeration so the apple can be all kinds of different things and it typical home said would have grown probably doesn't varieties\nAnd the store I did not want to deal with tons of different apples coming from different places they wanted one apple that they could stock everywhere\nThat would last for months and months and months in storage and what did they come up with\nThe enemy of our story the bad guy the or the evil red empire took over and invited sixties Seventy five percent of the apples growing in America we're red delicious and we all know what they tasted like they they were sold because they are bright red and people bought them\nPeople consistently bought the red or apple over the better tasting apple so that it gave us what we want it or what it looked like we want and\nI think that's very sad why because I I've been arguing for diversity and I tried to think of what would be a good what's a good way to think about what the loss of diversity brings 'cause it's kind of I mean you can get by without a lot of different apples but it's better with a lot of different apples\nThing about Shakespeare we could probably get by if we just had three plays of Shakespeare's that have come down to us King Lear hamlet and you know a light comedy called Honeycrisp or something but isn't that nice that we have thirty seven different sizes Shakespeare's\nIf you are listening to a food writer Raylan Jacobson says buckets apples uncommon character on Dina series featuring creatively says kind of a Jewish community center in San Francisco being that it's also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org\nEven better thing about dogs\nWe could probably get by with three dogs to write if you've got like\nA great Dane a border collie and a toy poodle but everybody gets something pretty close to what they want it might not be exactly what would be the best one for you but everybody's covered\nBut thank goodness there's a lot of sharp pays an Australian sheep dogs out there you know thank goodness there's a a a type of dog that's just right for everybody and hopefully there are are going to be a lot more apples out they're\nEasily accessed and that's happening now because Apple's are extremely patient long lived beings there's nothing for Apple tree to go a hundred years it'll even go to a hundred years just kinda like waiting for us to come to our senses and turn around so there are still apple trees out there\nHundreds of varieties that have been lost to us or nearly lost and all you need to do is find one of those trees and take a few shoots and you can ... shoots and bring that\nVariety back into commercial circulation and that's happened there's a lot of apple collectors out there there's actually some people right in this room who are part of that\nWho have all these apples available apples that are unlike any other ones we tend to taste and grocery stores and stores are starting to come around and be willing to to work with these apple so it's a pretty exciting times what this means is that\nAs heirlooms now have this new or the renaissance that's going on we're going to start seeing Apple's so much better than what we've seen before for certain things all the apples you tend to see out there in a store are desert what's called an industry desert apples they're meant for eating fresh\nThere isn't a single apple out there maybe you could with the exception of Granny Smith\nThat's intended to be a baking specialist but back in the day they were apples that were baking specialists you wouldn't want to get them fresh but they had us firms to them and acidity and flavor that made pies ... better than anything and we see today with with the ... we have to work with\nSo there are on the goals arise somebody today at their mentioned that belt Abbas coup\nAn incredible street all apple from Holland that is turning out more and more farmers markets\nAre there we're going to see some baked apples implies that are truly phenomenal\nSide or two is cool again ... acceptable that for instance the Hudson Valley has seized on it as a way to save their uh orchard culture that they still have because they haven't been able to compete on the commodity market but they're they're going heart into hearts either\nAnd we don't know what is going to happen with side right now the whole side of the world is kind of in the trajectory that the craft beer world was Twenty years ago it's following that same pack straight up like really exploding lately\nSo it's pretty exciting time to to to pay attention to side or because it's wide open because we lost that tradition there are no rules and so everyone is all over the place trying barrel aged fighters flavors that writers and ice fighters\nCan sort of a English draft style fighters cider effort seats that are almost more like a vermouth\nWe don't know what's going to end up being the the right side or are there is not going to be a rights are it's gonna be everything sweet dry ... and that's um I haven't seen a brand new beverage come into being like that not brand new brand new to us\nAlso we don't know what the right apples are going to be for it this is a pretty exciting experiment or that Harris and apple that I mentioned was not quite last we thought it was gone and then a fruit collector guy in the Nineteen eighties found one old tree and New Jersey grafted it\nGave the ah the samplings and the sign would to a few people\nAnd now the first um commercial crops of Harrison in probably a hundred and Twenty years are just coming into fruition a few people are getting Harrison fruit like no one even knew what the fruit would be like so it's ... it's almost as if we lost you know when ... disappeared from\nFrom our our culture and then somebody found one and started growing and um\nYou get to taste the wine for the first time so look for Harris insiders and maybe two years\nThe ... is alive and well not just here but there's a big nonprofit were not being a very tiny nonprofit who's got a a big plan to bring the tipping back and make it the official apple of New York city so they're young fifth injuries planning all over New York city now back to its roots and back to Capitol Hill where where\nTo read growing pippins and making tip insider right where his plantation was\nSo my my point is that uh we're in the second age of the apple and it's going to be a very exciting thing to watch and I hope you all will have a seat at the table and enjoy it [noise] ...\n[noise]\nThank you so much I Know we all have questions and then if you raise your hand outcome to\nCan you graft multiple um ... types onto the same trees for that so you have four ... growing on one tree yeah and actually all the old farms that used to have that it was called the family tree\nAnd usually it would be right in the front yard every branch would be a different variety and you'll see some of the of the collectors they do that today it looks crazy you know like the bottom of the tree will be read apples and then you'll get a stripe of yellow apples and the green apples on top it's really fun to do that actually I've done some of that in my house\nSo you said that\nAll apple tree assert from graft ... not from seats all the apples yeah\nIsn't that an officer um every every grabbing skiing on earth is a clone of that first grabbing steam that was found somewhere in Denmark and the sixteen hundreds\nSo if we take the seeds from our apples it's a whole new we're going to get a phone new variety if it even grow and then you get to name it after yourself cool\nSeriously\nSo what kind of apple would you recommend for Apple cake\nWell do you want from apples and your apple cake or do you want a mushy tender apples\nI think for I don't know I I if I definitely for although ... to make a great apple pie you really want like five different kinds of apples that's the key to a goodbye is some from some sweet some tart one that's a little more gloomy we'd kind of glue everything together\nBut each one's gloomy well randomly seedlings ... somebody's drunk rarely see going out there right hidden star orchard there growing brand new seedlings which is the pie apple in England\nBut like the French like really from apple and their pilots we do but in England brand Lee ... is a really gloomy apple that it kind of breaks down and make some more of a taste so\nWhen you're ... randomly seedlings are already in a couple of years I'd I'd drop one of those but Macintosh actually breaks down pretty well too\nSo when I was a kid in Pennsylvania we used to go out to the country and get golden delicious apples and they were just restaurants the tree and they were wonderful I have no see those apples anymore what happened\n[noise] yeah you uh you know the golden delicious which\nIs now one of those other apple we kind of make fun of what is considered one of the greatest apples that are ever been found when it was considered so good that the nursery like this one farmer discovered it showed it to a local nursery\nThey bought the apple off of him for five thousand dollars and a nine hundred foot plot of land around the apple and they put up an electric cage around it so that nobody could produce field you know to get a graft off of it so they would have a monopoly on the golden delicious and they did they made a million dollars off the apple\nI Can't totally convey it all the things that I've learned on a deeply personal level and then in this kind of um [noise] in a collective sensibility for the type of community we've been able to build\nAround the farm I mean I think to me when I started I think as an adoptee and not growing up in Korean culture um [noise]\nYeah there is this way that in gauging with plans was like the way that I knew how to kind of explore\nMy identity and my sense of place within Korean lineage\nUm and so I Know that in a lot of indigenous languages on this continent like plant roughly translates to a those who take care of us and I feel like that has been my sense of things like growing plants [noise]\nI'm really guided me toward like these connections with different people or it felt resident in a way that I could connect with others within Korean community and I think in the bay especially back Korean community is so diverse um ended in braces and is very accessible for a lot of folks that\nSo I just feel very lucky in that regard\nYou're listening to farmer community organizer and environmental justice advocate Christian leach from now move farm she joined in conversation by secure assembly on Dina a series featuring creatively says from the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nBeing at is also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\n[noise] but yeah I sort of reverse\nUm and through learning about plants\nHaving um a context to start with I had to ask questions and I'm\nBeing fairly inch reverted just in general like it was good to kind of have the plans push me towards like needing to be curious no way that made me talk to other human and not be alone on the farm pretty educational plant yeah\nYeah definitely and so I think you know like do he is already sort of resident shopping on the farms are like extremely blessed in that regard\nUm but when I heard that music at our first you saw and\nJust thought I was like oh if my plants can have like a heartbeat that sounds like the way do he plays the strong men my farm is going to be really really healthy\nUm and the thinking about that music and what she explained to everybody is like it led farming be this kind of very vast inexpensive conversation it's like a conversation with these plans and like trying to figure out how to adapt to a different climate scenarios the conversation with a path in his conversation with the future [noise] um\nSo it really does feel like once you get into this weird seed brain you know like everything is connected to seed which makes for very boring happy hour conversation with me sometimes\nBut on the other hand you know if you want to go down a very weird biology worm hold and\nWe're good yeah\nI I'm One of our conversations before this event we talked about you know the story telling that happened ... so you know I'm\nYou know we're both folks of color and even though we come from different parts of the of the ... you know my ancestors brought over many sees you this hour on which help propel an entire industry and said folks for hundreds of years which is now mostly forgotten um\nAnd you know there's a lot lost in that when you don't mind fully cultivate and safe\nSo I was wondering what sort of the stories are locked or fountains do you find yourself wanting to tell or is he needs to be told through the cultivation mhm [noise]\nI mean are the line that we curate their kid is always called second generation beads because it both has this reference to lineage and for folks living in diaspora an immigration\nAnd it also is a very nerdy seed reference because I'm so we like saying second generation is also a nod to just like getting back to our biology that has any sort of reverence for the intelligence of plants and actually taking our cues from them\nAnd so I think that\nUm I'm not like putting my ear to a seed and listening for the story but I Do think that there is a story telling nature to that and when I look at the history of some of the seats that we've collected some of the seeds that we've made it our job to kind of reproducing duplicated like the story that they're telling is one of like\nCenturies of farming that was like\nYou know like didn't require a lot of capital it didn't require a lot of off the farm inputs it was designed around the nature of like things working in a symbiotic way that had a respect for like our place within a natural system\nAnd so you see these seeds they can perform and like these types of very minimal system like subsistence farming systems and the way that they behave in reflects like kind of this relationship\nAnd then I think during the field trials like we see a very different story unfold like what hybrids looked like when they perform and what's the story they want to tell is which is like a story that is hard to compete with who are hard to argue against because farmers are so strapped\nAnd so the type of march and if the outcomes and that kind of control that it offers is very desirable for the way our food\nFind for long term success for farmers and so with returning to airlines is kind of like trying\nTo\nBe like what is the story we want to kind of tell to the future and if these plants are so valuable if there are just plants that we just know we could not live without like we brought all these love letters that people from our normal program on the farm wrote to plants with the Korean diaspora for like oh there's plants that are really significant to Koreans in Korea\nAnd what does that look like and why is there are significant for folks living in diaspora\nAnd we're like let's have you write a love letter to them not just talking about their role in your memories but talking to them as like this you know the president's in your life and thanking them for their struggles because a lot of plants have been cultivated for like ten thousand years\nAnd for some of those plans that means a ten thousand generations of some things um and I think that that sort of given take like felt very compelling to see the way people responded on the farm because\nIt was like the less you're able to objectify something and the more you're just like learn to love it it's like you can never put a dollar amount on that and they can't just be a commodity you know and so I think that that may be one of the parts of the story that we do want to tell on the farm\nI'm so even as a farmer and we're using seat as voice seed to tell a story um you're still working within the constraints um because sometimes those fees for how they get ... states is controlled by industry with a specific agenda\n'em and targeting certain countries in certain um jak spreads for success\nNot to preserve culture heritage but to turn a profit so wondering if you could talk about kind of that tension um and and give us some insight into that and and how the impacts your work as a farmer [noise]\nI mean Korea has been subject to the green revolution very similarly as most places around the globe and so\nYou know kind of starting with Jack ... Japanese colonialism where it's sort of shifted agriculture to be more focused on export\nLeading into kind of the Korean War and Korea being like the top consumer of us are fuss during that time like being billed as like kind of emergency aid and then transitioning to being like a consumer for export and then that\nRelationships still exist to this day to her variety of like free trade agreements and trade liberalization over the past two decades um so when I went to Korea there was the constraints that you speak about like salt so palpable\nBecause we would travel with these seats that we were kind of collecting and talking to other small farmers\nAnd we got the it's like really beautiful sleepy and and\nI was just so struck by like how incredible this was in soil being something that is so maligned you know because of the way that it takes its form currently in our society um\nAnd so we had these beans and we show people and it like everyone really responded oh yeah I remember those beans like oh do you want to grow them and just by and large people just felt like no you should take them because they'll be safer and like you can protect them in the states and it's also sad to just be like oh everyone\nLike remember these things but the incentive for them were just like just not possible given the nature of like how much land is being lost and Korea how much the kind of shift to just being under cut by foreign imports how much labor is shifting to be in the industrial sector\nOr so when you're looking at the kind of bigger landscape politically of like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Binah", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
