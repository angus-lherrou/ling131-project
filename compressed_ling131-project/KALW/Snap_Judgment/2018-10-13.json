John Dickey the pro rock climbing [noise] throw the freest of the free the brightest brave to paint travel the world and climbed the hardest in most things out\nIn two thousand north space sponsored the for them to climb in the minds of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year had her name a destination yes\n[noise] [noise] [noise] the climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the kerosene valley and the yellow came into view they were blown away probably what\nImpact of this and that is that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than ours are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nThat's Jason Smith he'd put the whole expedition together and was the de facto leader of the group that was John the photographer Beth the world class and only female climber of the group and her boyfriend Tommy it was the youngest said before for Tony the other one was his first big sponsored climb\nHas about a thousand foot tall really yellow chunk of granite that shaped a bit like a snow plow blade\nI really share outfits like no legislative really stop on\nIf you're up starts they set up a little Base Camp for their supply and skipped out the train then once everything was\nOh halfway up the wall and it was a pretty pretty nice evening actually I think it was telling me the twentieth birthday and we had a little party for Tommy we had chocolate but he went to bed at ten o'clock that night up on the mountain looking down on the world\nIt was a beautiful night no natural light anywhere so the stars are just really and it was pretty pretty dreamy you know\nWhile we were asleep on the class and are too poor to ledges that than Tommy where I'm One and John and I were in the other about six Fifteen in the mornings kind of is the first rate of life started to fill the sky in the morning like gunshot cracked off\nIt was rattling Lee scary and the bullet hit the wall Fifteen feet away so we all kinda got shower of Iraq fragments you can't run away the port alleges are made of fabric on the bottom so you're half expecting bulletins just ripped through you from the from the bottom up\nA second gunshot went off and at that point I can see that there was three people at the base of the cliffs that we were on\nJohn Dickey the photographer he had a lung camera lens that he put it on a camera and he looked down and he could see the scary looking guys I'm with the guns and they were there were waving to us to come down and so John went ahead and volunteered to go down first\nHe explained that John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was in and get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under\nBelieves that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys is going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much\nI'm with them as victims of circumstances whether specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and going to jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah of in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors though they're split on now is only two characters with guns to far climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days\nStarving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was and we take guesses and it turns out it and five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely it was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ...\nWe're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time\nThe days just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd don't seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said to here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guide to Base Camp and [noise] I'm In and get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guy\nKind of set in this weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was state and obviously mess that he had bought the story that I spend a week selling tours and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to know [noise]\nYou know served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him became shot anyway has Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look of like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp\nWell Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was four to one\nFelt like my rib cage was going to explode there is is this\nBall and excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and the anger named a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying all that kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were\nThere like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy it just kind of came flying over the top of me in racing up to class and it just\nScrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but\nAs I was reaching out to grab it's God's job that he does what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and it just toppled over backwards or\nHe just kind of went in that sparks through them in like an eternity and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and his whole body let out this really horrible cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then best showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nAnd raptor arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember ... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um [noise] and um\nDeal was still out there so they had to move they scramble down the mountain towards a ... army outposts where they were greeted with gunfire\nAnd I saw a lot of lights flashing some bullets flying this guy definitely start tracer fire so they were kind of really a surprise to state for western kids come running out of the darkness and even worse on a\nNew and it took them a little while to figure out who we were and then they you know set us up and slapped is on the back and they gave us some water and sardines and warm clothes and stuff\nAnd then a helicopter flew in\nKind of pre steamy dressed man got out\nHe stepped off kind of out of dust cloud and came walking up to me and he said and you know perfect English are you OK\nAbout a month after they return home she got a phone call from journalist Greg Child who had been writing about their story he said he got a call from the ... government with unbelievable news to who they had all seen fall to his dad was alive\n[noise] and I said that's impossible\nThat is completely impossible [noise] um I Love this guy slide through the air in front of me and hit the ground and\nLet out this horrible exploding sound and go tumbling off again [noise]\nJohnson the same as just as possible\nAnd then um he faxed us or a photograph that the army it's done through that was clearly sue\n[noise] and yeah I was astounded will never understand how we survive\nI remember um being happy that he and died for sure but really what can you be more of a bit odd you know I had the capacity I sort of had this like evil inside of me that allowed me to kill I think most people\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous\nLike there's a story about playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\n[noise] so I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all better from their\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection\nTreasure even if they help you know\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing some of my regret about my own dreams because I still\nTop symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime ...\nMinute to him that one of my biggest regrets the surgeries and and my surgeries on\nIt's made me a ... somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm [noise] so\nCan I get a little fish philosophical with you\nThere is a contract [laughter] okay um so in like ... story with Amy and binge pushed to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's the term entire brain or some thing less physical and I wonder if Dr\n... my only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to their real expensive we having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle and\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent two was just talking and butter Jay British and shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read\nAnd there for a few minutes as I watched him try to catch his breath I I\nI thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got ... hospital room in the eyes you see them in a coma and\nCondition than I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\n\n\nGoing to take a short break\nAs they make the decision that you know family you should never have to make\nA snap judgment the override episode continues to stay to\n[noise] [noise]\n\nI'm Harry Shearer hosted will show a weekly walk through the worlds of media politics intro business delivered solve apology along with an\nClick to mix the mysterious music in the bay area you can hear live show only on KLW

nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and cats or wherever pond cats are found\nFrom WNYC Studios will come back to snap judgment override episode when it was in Washington\nAnd we left off young man's Spencer you lay unconscious in hospital because of the melt formation in his brain and all of his family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nSpend you had to strip and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what could be ... to me they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey surgeons namely Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they would they won ... percent chance it's been the would have another strip and that chance would increase every year the life\nBut the surgery he was posing with a very risky when Dr King when explaining these very daunting odds any recording it\n'cause you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nAt some risk associated with it about five to ten percent chance of a major complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between\nThe surgery before the ... [noise]\nI think that the situation is dramatically changed and knowing that we do now with all that you\nWhat we want to do I think that the physician and putting your guys then is to make that\nKnows him better than review\nSo it's not what you want or what I Am on Iran or with mom or dad around\nPerformed another surgery with a cup of coffee or cut I heard of the brain can actually yes that okay in that deep Kevin spite me that\nHe got sick I have done most although I Know that there's risk for is not a theoretical risk if they're real risk it if\nIt happens all those particular surgery central done in that area what was the outcome of your\nPercent of a five to ten percent of them have a bad outcome\nThat they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy trying to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a complication around and you can't just keep going around in circles wondering like well\nIt's important that it's an actual decision but it's also an intuitive one I think the best decisions are likely to feel good about not just in your rationalizing and so forth also you're\nListening to your doctor Kim left the room any luggage Steve stew and said\nIf that's the other ... you know I just say for weeks or so before we said before\n... yeah I Want to I Want to\nTo sort of yeah I Want to go\nYou can with the other who are slow to your to your restaurant herself checked out here that's hard for\nTo say I don't think he would say yes I think he would say no\nGoes back to what\n[noise] I think Spencer was worried about\nThe possible side effects of operating on that region right [noise] and how you might not turn out nearly the same outcome or\nIt was very risky\nThey altered the questions over and over in their heads for twenty four hours the truth is that they were faced with the small but very scary possibility that you could die without the surgery so like most people do when faced with the option they opted for life with a rich that that life would be depreciated", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "13"}
