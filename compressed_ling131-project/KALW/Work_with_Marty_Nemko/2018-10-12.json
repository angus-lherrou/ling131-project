{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "C. R. W. this is left right and center\n[noise] welcomes waste special edition of KCRW was left right center decisions decisions I mean do you live from the commonwealth club in San Francisco [noise]\n\nAlways left right and center as you're civilized provocative an antidote to self contained opinion bubbles the dominant political debate I'm Josh Barrow your host your center and business columnist at New York magazine on the right as making McConnell Washington Post columnist on the left is Ana Marie Cox host of with friends like these and columnist for ... girls\nAnd please join me in welcoming our first to special guest Ken white criminal defense attorney and my co host on our special left right and center series all the president's lawyers and Kim Miller Republican strategist and former communications director for Jeb Bush [noise]\n\nWelcome everybody I Want to start by talking about President Trump's taxes or rather his father's taxes the New York times published this expos a fourteen thousand words I Hope you will read it in its entirety\nAnd it describes how Trump's parents passed an enormous fortune hundreds of millions of dollars down to Donald and his siblings well paying very little state or gift tax this of course runs contrary to Trump's self mythology as a man who got rich starting with only a million dollar loan\nThe ... the tax strategies the times describes many of them are aggressive but some of them of the times felt comfortable calling outright fraud including a scheme to disguise gifts by inflating business expenses the Trump children would invoices or the parents buildings evading taxes in the process\nOf making the wall Street Journal ran a column by Holleman Jenkins that mocked the times for expecting quote rigid adherence for the law is this like is this normal rich person behavior should we be outraged by this\nWell okay let's let's there are a couple of things going on I mean the first is look it is true that tax the tax code is so complicated that like there is no hard bright line\nAnd not all but then as you can tell some things you can tell right if you have the money acts lawyers would they would take to differ I wouldn't let you have money in a Swiss bank account and like you're not paying taxes on it that's just illegal and we know that but things like transfer pricing things like your kids haven't company that bills you\nThings like having your kids on the payroll of your company\nThere are actually quite complicated tasks for whether those things are fraudulent or not\nUm and so I think what this actually indicates is\nThe complexity in our tax code which is there to try to sort of squeeze every last dollar out of companies and so forth is that it would be better if we the simpler tax code that just tax income when it hit a person regardless of who that person was and so and so you could still have a progressive income tax and get rid of the corporate income tax\nWhich would there then lay and get rid of the estate tax and treat estates and also as income if you did that then there would be no kind of arbitrage between trying to take this basically a one of the things that sort of under discuss this was tax arbitrage right you're you're paying the money to him in income rather than inheritance because inheritance has a higher tax rate\nSo if you just haven't won tax rate\nFor everything there wouldn't be all of these opportunities all of these these\nKind of games that we have to argue about whether they're fraud or not ... ... what did you make of that because I found you know reading this long article ... there was a lot of stuff that sounded like basically just what rich people do with their money but there was some of it that sounded like no this is not something that everybody does this was very unusual quite fraudulent behavior\nThat most rich owners of buildings in New York would not have thought they could get away with yeah there is a mix of stuff\nThat you get audited for if they catch and stuff you get indicted for if they catch and they have the resources to go after you so some of the things that were described in that article or a classic frauds games you know in inflating invoices undervaluing a property is by far\nThe ten that get you prosecuted in any context including the tax and the reason you do it is because the IRS investigates\nSuch a tiny percentage of people audit so few of them and criminally investigates even fewer but it's absolutely the type of conduct that if my clients get caught doing it and uh someone from iris the ideas come knocking I'm telling you I'm a I'm a need a pretty big deposit\nFor that [laughter] ... it was at one point your job to stop Donald Trump from becoming\nDrags out here firing the race and so\nThis is you know one in in many store a line of very long line of stories about either that Donald Trump's businesses were any or that his businesses were not terribly successful and there's just you know endless stories like this but I think part of why the story\nDidn't get as much attention as it feels like it ought to have this even though it was huge news in certain ways it felt like old news and people always assumed that Trump was cheating and the trumpet really inherited a lot of money even though they claim they didn't\nSo I guess the question is how do when you were trying to get people to care about this sort of thing\nHow did how did voters feel about that [noise] you know\nOne of the things that we ended up unfortunately been kind of an unknown I Know that was one swing voters actually thought about this I I thought it was one of the bigger failures of a of the Hillary campaign and they're super PAC was that they didn't even try to really run ads on this they didn't try to message against that\nWe did a bit in the primary what we found was that primary voters just didn't buy it right Republican primary voters saw rich guy the ... festival guy\nAnd I'm you know they they saw these schemes was kind of general the way you do business if you're somebody like Donald Trump\nI I don't know that that\nWould have translated into a general election audience that's kind of an unknown known a few hours as Rumsfeld would say um but I Would I think that the times story brought up for me\nWas I felt like there was a lack of interest among the press corps in in pressing him on his business interests because they felt like these stories landed with a good ... and here's the thing there's this big open question uh what what we now know is that from Trump or a engaged in some\nEthically dubious maybe fraudulent they'd be illegal schemes\nI've pretty much everybody on the stage agrees that if we opened up the book of the Trump Organization that and he was not the president that he would be in handcuffs\nLike I I don't think that anybody thinks the Donald Trump was not engaging in illegal activity at the Trump Organization a bud ... a a from a campaign standpoint he managed to get away with it because voters didn't care but but you know there should be another standard of of groups of people who care leads to care if voters don't care\nSo what's what's the play here for Democrats what should the media will be doing that it's not I mean if it feels like this is something that should hurt the president hurt Republicans politically and yet it's not one off\nLike definitely I guess I Believe in the broken windows theory of tax fraud which is that we should care and that you care about the little things it's not you don't do sort of jury nullification arguments about tax fraud like if it's something illegal it's illegal and we should find out more about it\nUm and I do think that this is a problem I think Tim Israelis are it in on what the problem for the presses which is that uh if you think of ... no one's gonna care about a story like even if it's a big story like you have less incentive to do it I mean I think the time should be you know I mean\nI have mixed feelings about this because I I feel like they did all this work and they put all this energy into it they took these reporters off their beach for almost a year and put all these resources in the paper and not only the statute of limitations passed on to tax fraud but it's passed on people's attention spans like it's just I also think\nIt it just falls into a category ... by the way I wasn't trying to say that like what he did was okay I was trying to say it's really complicated to sort out which basket things within the times article falls and fall into some of them are shady and some of them seem to be clearly illegal\nUm but you know there's this category and journalism called me go my eyes glaze over and taxes are just in that category trying to get anyone to care about taxes I've been trying for like Seventeen years now\nAnd it's just really difficult because it's complicated because you do explain all of these you know and it will carry forward was one of the things that he got paid for by the times earlier rate\nAnd people just don't care and I don't know why they don't care but you cannot get them to pay attention I think\nOne issue here might be the fact that we sort of created a culture where people think of tax fraud as being like if you're rich enough to get away with it like I Want aspire to that I Want to fire to tax\nFraud\nAnd we don't think it was always on the Republican primary for good for you know making\nWas talking about it also is sort of like we've we've we've made it like well and tax fraud who cares about talked about but you may if you turn it into like he took money out of the pockets of people like you know people don't think of it that are a lot of people don't know if I had asked me what I Would do that and it's just it's just the ... the low level you know like if you're paying\nThe handyman in your house in cash and you're not paying sales tax and he's not reporting that income people behave like this in a in a very small way and their personal lives and I think imagine that if they were very rich they would behave like a very large way they don't think they're taking money out of somebody's pocket when they don't pay sales tax on September\n... like I ... it's hard for me to it because I spent so much time and\nTwenty sixteen criticizing him for everything and and for the the way he was ... his\nHis contractors and suppliers and I thought that was going to land and it didn't and when he didn't chandelier guy when he didn't he he like he still has to all of these small businessmen in Atlantic City\nAnd when it came down to and I'm not sure how much of this was motivated reasoning and how much of this was really true but there was a sense that like all these rich guys cheat anyway right and so I'm not\nInvestigation this complexity typically would be a but you know a month law and this type of thing when he's doing things behind the scenes as nothing doesn't signify anything\nThe other thing about ... cells Trump that's related to this is is less I think about the excitement among the base but more about the fact that we're talking less about Donald Trump\nAnd and you saw this in twenty sixteen where anytime from was in the news for a given week his poll numbers with ... a little bit because you know while we were a polarized country this is a small percentage of people that hate Donald Trump and also hate the Democrats and so when Donald Trump's on the TV all the time that I I really dislike the Scott\nBut when he's not when Brett Kavanaugh is on TV all the time they start to forget like we've all turned into Donald Trump a little bit we all of the memory of him that now in cycles\nAnd so this habit and twenties sixteen where the the Access Hollywood tape happened three weeks out and and it was like Donald Trump's done and then he behaved for two and a half weeks paid for him right uh and and didn't make a ton of news and the Kobe thing happened and that made a ... a real difference in the end of the twenty sixth in campaign and so\nThere there could be a change like that either in his favor or against and the next three weeks\nWe'll we'll see if he manages to uh to keep quiet for for that kind of period I Can't wait I Want to thank you for joining us like you coming up I'll be coming up I'll be back with Megan

Republican strategist to Miller is with us and I want to welcome ... Lopez who is senior finance correspondent for Business Insider\nAs we tape on Thursday evening the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen Thirteen hundred points and two days and\nPresident Trump knows why\nWe have an interest rates going up and then flipped that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the sun is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nWith the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates although not all that quickly and not this week what has happened is long term interest rates have been going up a lot on the open market and that's bad for stocks and it makes it more expensive to get a mortgage but it also might be necessary if the fed is going to have to keep raising rates in order to stop inflation\nMaking is is Trump right about the fed have they been raising interest rates to much are they screwing up for things for him politically by pushing the stock market out in inflation is\nNot particularly high and you know like the fat likes to to run the you know they want to nip it in the ... I Want to get ahead of if they want to get ahead of of of inflation's like maybe they're a little too tight and it's\nSort of hard to judge rate 'em but whether or not they're wrong Trump is wrong to go after them right because then the independence of the Federal Reserve having an independent central bank was a tremendous achievement\nAnd it took decades to build up the credibility that the president does not interfere with interest rates I mean like fat you know Nixon's Federal Reserve was like a little too close with Nixon and that was really bad for the country\nAnd he should keep his hands off of the ... the same reason that he shouldn't say many of the things that he says I'm because he is chipping away really important civic institutions that are important for our economy that are important for a civic society they're important for our democracy um do I expect him to like\nHave a change of heart and realize that challenging that independence as a bad idea no but you know in an ideal world where Donald Trump listen to someone\nI wouldn't do that so that the funny thing here is that the fed at least ... for an institution in Washington seems to basically ignore the president when he runs his mouth like threat so that part or or like arguably one could actually see the fed being like oh yeah\nYou see this\nJust to prove that the president is not telling them what you heard that that's like some people's real concern oh well that's this is where this is where the tradition that the president doesn't comment on interest rates comes from it or not it doesn't go back to George Washington we didn't have his even back back then it's not in the constitution\nIt was the Clinton Administration and the reason they did it was the George each W. Bush spent a lot of Nineteen Ninety two complaining that interest rates are too high and the fed was too worried about inflation or should be cutting rates\nAnd the perception was that the fed had actually become more reluctant to cut rates because they thought if they did it with\nDidn't talk about interest rates not because he was super disciplined and carry thought it would actually interfere with the fed doing what he wanted but so I mean if we set aside should the president be talking about this you are you actually sort of think that he's right about the merits you're right the like the fed has been I can too fast they are\nTo their two arguments and Wall Street has no idea which one is right and one is at inflation Israel and so you should keep hiking and the other is that you know we just have too many bonds because central the central banks are buying them any more than ... easing program is pretty much done and so\nYou know we have all the supply and we don't have anybody who wants to buy them so maybe you know you you don't hike rates\nYou have to what that means basically because there's so many bonds out there that the fed is you know it doesn't it's not a market buying them anymore that interest rates will go up on their own as those bonds and he defined by the ... is basically putting too much fuel on the fire by by hiking itself but\nThen again nobody actually knows if that's true and the Donald Trump definitely doesn't know of that so I don't know what he's talking about and there are a lot of economists and there are a lot of people and I I you know in my reporting go away I Do is I call around and\nAsk people and if some of the smartest people on Wall street on any answer this question then Donald Trump certainly does it\nSo you know we ... either way interest rates grow up we get we get a stock sell off\nWhy because of the way that corporate balance sheets are now you know interest rates are low they borrowed a lot interest rates are going up they're going to have to pay back that get they have them it's going to be more expensive for them so margins are going to get that are so stocks are going to go down\nIt's not rocket science and um it and it's not something that we can really help because this is the way that things were set up\nA sign of the the funny thing here for me is that you know I mean the president is right that the higher rates are pushing stocks down enough kind of embarrassing for him the remarkable thing is the fed is run by the guy he picked to run it that's the fire the fed cherry hired a new fed chair and then the other thing that's kind of weird for Trump is he's mad at the fed\nWon't really go after drone Powell the fed chairman that personally in fact he did this like I'm not bad I'm just disappointed bit\nWhich is not really a thing Donald Trump does he's doing it with the fed chairman\nNow this is one of the things that he believes forever like he's had this theory to the extent it's a theory about monetary policy like for yeah it's been like it's like the human body is a battery theory than\nLow interest rates because he's used to being a guy who was in debt and I are as money so he's he's he's a low interest rate but it's one of those\nCases where he has his policies when the few things it's like in a constant for him he really really generally believe that he's just like not bothered to set up a government that would enact the policy he cares about what he just has a belief\nThat general broad general description of higher or a cat and mouse game or a Woodward book that why does he believe the things we don't know he's just believed him for Thirty years\nOn rural like this is him or the same as a matter even maps earlier like this was Donald Trump view of two modes argue about helping me or somebody that's hurting me that's what he cares really over the long term economic benefits the obviously over here with the deficit or the death\nAnd and he doesn't care about the fed policy except to the extent but right now he thinks that of making the economy go slower and so bad that where he is he's a ... there's a there are people who are against him were buyout are hurting\nIran what about Jared the business and and the other\nThing is I feel like you know this just comes off along sort of news cycles where the president was complaining that people don't give him enough credit for how good the economy is and how strong the stock market and then you have a two day sell off and he switches to explaining how what happened to the stock market is somebody else's fault\nAnd raven up your ... your ...\nAnd there's always a tweet right like there isn't there he doesn't have a tweet about the president should be impeached the stock market like tanks\nA thousand points that you're always\nA treat so I'm so drawn\nBox and that's Kanye West I'm\nCalling you a fresh off wearing his ... had the Saturday Night live he went to the White House on Thursday to meet with the president and he talked about how great the ... makes them feel\nLike everyone but\nMake me guy didn't get to see that all the time like a guy\nOn social media from my readers and so forth is like two groups of people who feel completely powerless and get outraged when you suggest that in fact\nThey have quite a bit of power in in the institutions that control and so you will say something like well you know the left is getting pretty good at shutting the right completely out of university and they'll do like what about southern governorships right and and vice versa the right to spite controlling\nBoth houses of Congress the presidency and now the Supreme Court really feels like liberals have won the culture war and are just preparing to destroy them and I think that like\nThat sort of describes a lot of what his worst about our politics in this moment\nAna Marie Cox and I think that she could kind of directly to that but what they talking about a a metaphor I heard recently Democrats are pointing at the rule book screaming\nIsn't allowed to play basketball when the dog dunks on them over and over and the crowd goes why\nIs this Airbus three I Hope I mean it's like\nThree rabbit in the White House [laughter] my uh my weight of the week comes from Oliver Darcy who's a media reporter at CNN he tweeted Barnes and noble announcing a press release the political book sales have jumped fifty seven percent in twenty eight team compared to the year before\nThe retailer released this map showing which states we're interested in books critical positive of Trump and if you look at the map the map looks you really similar to the twenty sixteen election map know a few few states has flipped\nThis is still a map that would elect Donald Trump president so I Apologize\nThe Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college in Barnes and noble although I don't know maybe she won the popular vote I don't know what the totals were in in California and New York but it really illustrates the divide in the nation remains almost exactly what it was on election day almost two years ago or Tim Miller I Want to thank you very much for

W. here in the bay area as we're home station alright during those phones off again more of a large decisions decisions coming right up\n\nBack again with a special live left right and center at in forum at the commonwealth club in San Francisco I'm your host Josh Barrow on the right is making McCord all of the Washington Post on the left is Ana Marie Cox hosted with friends like knees and columnist for ... girls\nWhen Lopez is senior finance correspondent Business Insider and has been recently reporting extensively on Tesla and a little news there\nAnd Andrew pro is the founder of radiance strategies where he advises on regulatory policies he worked for the Obama administration in the office of information and regulatory affairs\nWe have Lynette Andrew here with us because we're in San Francisco and they want to talk about tax and and how we in tech are doing like are we cool do we like each other and not or what\nTheir these companies companies with fans companies that produce products and services materially change our lives companies we sometimes feel aren't really listening to us we're taking our concerns seriously companies it's sometimes seem to view regulation as a nuisance to be ignored\nDrew I Want to start with you since you advise these companies on how to be regulated I think back to the launch of ... and their view essentially was launched first whether it's legal or not get people to fall in love with the service and then there the government to try to ban it and it didn't work everywhere but it worked in a lot of places in the company had a pretty positive public image for a number of years until it didn't\nNow Hoover is viewed as a company with a cultural problem and an allergy to compliance that hurts it and it's trying to figure out I mean more of a normal mature company that follows rules\nHow how does the industry overall approaching this is there still just sort of gratitude to regulation that it's something that you can just sort of walk past or is there more of a sense that the rules apply to people they need to figure out how to follow them\nShape them so that they work for industry and the public at the same time yeah I think that ... is a specific case that speaks to the general attitude a very clearly if you were here a couple of years ago I think there was a very much an attitude of move fast and break\nYou look toward policy or a you know politics in general was very much a that's a back east problem and we're San Francisco and doing her own thing\nBut ... run into this problem everybody started to this problem I think that one of the things that's changed is just a sense of scale I'm as these companies have gotten larger and larger and gotten more and more market power they become much more salient dominant are large and various ways\nA we're interacting with more a more times a day more times a week uh we're seeing them crop up on you know every sector of the economy and they're having just a much larger impact\nOn all sorts of ... I mean ... not only has issues with regulatory policy in specific cities\nBut I'm also issues with what sort of impact or they're going to have on the economy in the future with unemployment and that sort of thing um so I just think of these companies become larger and larger scale is bigger there is a definite shift in attitude I mean you can see that ... Amazon Facebook Twitter\nYou know there's been a change just in the last six months as all these tech companies or you know being forced to testify before Congress a and there's a growing sense that these are\nYou know important policy questions that they have to pay attention to what I Want to talk with you about one company that is having its own running with regulators at the SEC who are forcing some organizational changes on it which has Tesla what you've been doing a lot of really great\nReporting on and I feel like Tesla sort of embodies the same time a lot of the best and the worst of Silicon Valley like they make really innovative products that a lot of consumers are really passionate about these products could do a lot of good in the world in the long run for the environments you on a mosque is a guy who puts rockets in space he believes he's a super genius because he is at least a regular genius\nAnd yet he's on Twitter calling the tie cave rescue up guy a pedophile and announcing a take private deal with ... bragging my source says yes any\nMoney from hedge fund managers um I I think that there are two things to think about this one is the move fast and break things each house should it be applied to everything and one thing that I find in my reporting about Tesla is that\nUh the same things that people criticize has before or the the things that people love has for\n'em when Iran gotten a Joe Rogan show\nThe first thing that Joe Rogan asked Iran was\nHow do you have all the time to just\nBuild rockets and dig holes and builds cars how she was telling your amazing but you could also say how do you have\nTime for this how no seriously how do you have time to tweet and vehicles and they'll ... now how do you have time [laughter] so there are two ways to think about that there are ... you move fast the right things you could say wow it's amazing how you build a car from design to launch so fast that's amazing the\nOther thing you can says oh you built a car from lunch to design so fast yikes yikes because it's a car that\nYou know a is consistently he's\nUnder under sold or under he's under performed in what he said he was going to do studies going to make X cars he actually made much less than that and so you know shareholders starting to wonder so do you move fast and break things when you're building cars is that\nGood it does seem like a bad a phrase I specifically to cars you\nTell and John and Silicon Valley I think it's starting to try to figure out is this\nSomething that should be applied to every single industry is this something that we can use on everything and the answer might be no because you know I must might go bankrupt um but ... and the and the other thing I Want to get to is you know\nCause is it okay to\nLie to regulators are lie to shareholders as long as you're making cars that are supposed to save the world\nThere's they're making what what do you make of the the SEC is in this weird position because they're supposed to protect shareholders and the the clear judgment of the market as the shareholders are better off\nIf mosque stays a CEO and so the the SEC is sort of trying to find a way to sort of you know like rap must on the ... so that he'll stop tweeting like this can continue to hopefully run his company like an adult it's a weird position\nFor the ... they have still not found that way right I mean the boards in that position as well you know I I think the the thing about manufacturing cars at scale is really hard right it's really difficult that's why there's not that many auto manufacturers because like there's only a few firms that have ever gotten a really good at making huge numbers of cars\nSo far Tesla is not one of those firms but like\nMosques sort of ... foods the sense that he could maybe one one of those people Sunday and he's got all of these fans who will just slapped a ... line up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Work with Marty Nemko", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "12"}
