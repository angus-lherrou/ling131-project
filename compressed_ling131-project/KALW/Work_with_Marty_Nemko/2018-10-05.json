{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Your work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nABC is twenty twenty did a feature on John chambers called the best boss in America maybe that's not surprising in that he grew Cisco Systems from four hundred employees to more than Seventy thousand more than ten thousand of whom became millionaires\nAnd Cisco wind from conducting a thousand devices to the Internet which is cool was formed to more than two hundred and thirty\nBillion today and\nInfrastructure for the both of the world's Internet traffic\nAnd then start up world quote we don't just make routers and\nSwitches were changing the way people work live play and lower end quote legendary cleaner Perkins chair Jon Dore gold that book quote a must read on best practices for any manager\nBut get this John chambers has been an adviser to Presidents Clinton and Bush\nFrench President a crumb Indian prime minister Narendra Modi Israeli president a Nobel Peace prize winner Shimon Peres\nAnd King Abdullah of Jordan so it's not surprising that he was named one of the time magazine's one hundred most influential people\nIn the world chambers now runs a company called Jaycee to that invest in what he believes are next big things from stopping drones from terrorizing us\nUsing crickets as a source of food protein what you believed on this show I Will dare to sample\nThem that much [laughter]\nI'll have with you [laughter] this is not just some fly in the night for the New York times recently touted but what can John chambers teach not just leaders but all of us about why he's working NY is living\nWith me in the studio is chairman of merit us of Cisco Systems and author of the just published connecting the dots John chambers walking to work with Marty Nemko\nMarty it's going to be found I can tell already we're going to have a great give and take\nI Know it off the air we were great [laughter] I was really do is really a ... it really is a privilege you know\n... All right here we go now whether it's a company or an individual that's had a downturn\nYour advice is to remain in the book you say you've got to assess how much of the problem is you and how much of the problem is external now in terms of your own introspection what would you say you've personally had to work on\n\nI think specifically answer your question ah what I had to work on is at times two thousand and one is an example I became too dependent upon the data\nAnd felt that the data had all the answers and so when you grow a company from dirty as you said earlier Seventy million in sales to forty seven billion dollars and you're good at sixty five percent a year in your accuracy of the forecast is amazing because you can get data in real time at a time than other people are just getting their data on facts\nAnd I was sure the data would tell me if there was a problem and it did not\nAnd in January of two thousand and even though our stock was dropping we were still growing it's Seventy percent in the first week of January [noise] by the third week we're dropping minus thirty we've never had negative growth ever [noise]\nAnd so uh what I learned is it's important to trust your data and your analytics if you will but it's also to constantly test and the market to see something if you're missing\nLesson learned for me the great recession of two thousand eight came we called up the summer of two thousand seven we said there's something wrong with the financial markets and everybody said no my numbers for the quarter really good\nAbove expectations but I said there's something wrong in the enterprise especially financial markets we could have a problem coming\nAnd they said no once again this is Cisco and and you're you're going to be wrong and sure enough within nine months we were in the greatest recession so I learned not just to trust my data but to be able when I got data to go out and listen to the customers about what makes sense\nSays listen to the customers and everybody says they do and reality most companies have the hubris to think maybe in the beginning will do a little bit of a market research and then the end they don't talk to customers very much first of all is my em influence accurate about that yeah it is I think\nBut he ... it took him seven years\nAnd he was amazing ah almost everything I Do I can tell you which customer recommended it which customers said square one of the I went under ... companies we did I can tell you which one said John you're you're quoting needs to be improved\nI can tell which ones they created a problem we help them through together so customer driven but the data that you're giving his right\nOn on the surveys have seen eighty percent of CEOs leave they delivered spirit customer service right yet when you contact their customers that consumers less than ten percent of the consumers later so\nThis is where you shouldn't believe your own marketing and it's so important as the c._e._o. especially in today's world to listen to all\nThe feedback to your company regardless of where it's a very small company are very big\nYou know there is so much of a tendency to BS the leaders whether it's your own employees who you know we say we where we want to hear people who disagree with us and if we got a big customer we ... we we say we really want to hear but most people like to be asked to\nHow do you what's the ... you come from West Virginia from a small with how do you get people to be really honest with you\nWell I think it has to do the leaders without realizing actually signal to their their teams whether they want candid exchange\nVery first time I met Jeff Welsh and many of your your viewers are we're not even listening or or maybe even born when Jack was such a great leader in Nineteen says on the show they were they when he was that he would basically any session with these people I went up to each one of the classes ... for him\nAnd he and his team were argument like I had not seen a line and and boy they went back and forth and back and forth and finally they agreed and they move forward\nAnd I said jak how do you do that he said that's the culture we have\nAnd then I said what's your biggest weakness watching to see how he would be with his team he said my biggest weakness is when I see somebody really super smart and good communicator I assume they could also be great and operations and let them go to long before I change if I looked at his team and they all said exactly\nSo I think leaders who are doing their jobs have to be secure in their jobs because the security issue and you've got to realize the only way you stay ahead as the market transitions write better than your counterparts\nSo the ability to listen and create what I call constructive friction actually like but once we're through the discussion there is no passive aggressive behavior we move toward a common goal and I think if you talk to people out of Cisco for the\nTwenty five years that I led the company or you would find that it was a family we didn't always agree or Indian I got to make the calls but it was an ability to have that healthy given taken before it and by the way that given takes safe you it isn't just a better writer in your company it saves you\nWant you to get specific with me and can you think of one example where someone of your employees or customer so John you're full of your dead wrong about this and we should do it this way and why and you actually change as a result in rather than fire the woman or man\nYeah well first I'd never raise my voice and I've heard that now by the way that does not mean that I don't have extremely high expectations that talk this six CEOs of start ups today that I'm coaching and the expectations were very high but I Believe that's not effective communications in fact a communications as you get the outcome that you want\nAnd don't be leaving ruined by fear right ah I Believe and ruined by logic and trust in India and I'll still make the call and say here's what we need to go\nBut an example would be very early on Nineteen Ninety three ah the first decision I make as I said we're not building routers we're building the Internet which are changed the way you work live learn and play\nAnd we have to change our position to that and even my marketing team didn't like that really didn't like it at all and then I said we can't be a router company we've got to go past switching company and then she read in the book I got some resistance especially on the company that I slacked than to go after yet those were two of the most fundamental moves that that we've ...\nTwo thousand they not only did we call it ahead of time and having gotten burned in two thousand one remember I wrote down two point five billion in him a twenty two thousand one [noise] ah and that's a lot of money even for the most valuable companies in the world most profitable or two thousand eight accident accredited automotive companies\nAnd several of my team including my board challenged me a little bit on that said John did you not learned from two thousand one I said yes I did this time I saw it coming\nThis time my peers are pulling out of their financial support for the companies and this time or I'm going to do the reverse I'm going to be a great partners automotive companies just like they did a great partnership me fast forward\nAll the automated companies made it through fast forward I was the number one player and every one of automotive companies now that doesn't mean that sometimes I get it wrong\nYou know flip camcorder I Love the concept I liked it but the minute associate jobs out maneuvers ACLU's the business and so when I get it wrong or fail fast is an important aspect but know that\nThat's exactly this is exactly you inject growth was on the show he had the ... he had this nickname called neutron jak for being a guy who did get rid of his bottom ten or twenty percent of people want a regular basis and I said how do you feel when when they call you knew from Jack and he said you know I'm proud of it says not everybody's meant to work a GE\nHe says you know our our code the remaining coworkers feel much more pride if I get rid of the the ones who are not strong my customers get a better prop when I first came over to G. E. R. at Consumer Reports are refrigerated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you've got electric car and I said ... and I do and you always let me call him by his first name and he's he he's just been almost like a father to me in so many ways and so generous with his time and he thought process and he said\nI Want to go see it drive it and I said a ...\nOver the foremost ... Mr President your security team told me I cannot move you off the top three rooms here\nAnd he said John on the wrestling I said I said and so we started down when he was death came running up to me quitting since John we're not prepared for this but secondly something you need to know\nHe hasn't had a license for ten years he cannot drive the car [laughter] this is going to be interesting but he was so curious and at that time you're talking about late eighties early nineties and yet he was thinking like a teenager\nAnd dreaming big dreams and he has the same philosophy that do and I learned part of the front of me my regret isn't that dream too big that says going occasionally miss I Wish I Dream bigger and I wished on this more\nAnd he taught me that in in so many unique\nWay I Want to talk about creating a store to coach because that's where the drugs can recreate and the fact that is the name of the book who is the ... the author said book who is my\nGuest fellow Taipei [laughter] time to move to vote somebody in the energy [laughter] that is correct chairman emeritus of Cisco his book connecting the dots lessons for leadership in\nA startup world let's start micro and then we'll get ... I got there are many people who you are listening to the show who are either in startups contemplating Serbs or whatever\nYou were running a company that is you were kind of supervising you if you will ... of a bunch of companies that are start ups what do you want to tell our listeners about something that's not obvious about how to make a startups ...\nWell it starts with something Marty that that is basic but most people don't take time to analyze and\nYou've got to get a market in transition business model wise or health care wise or government wise and combine it with the technology that's new and transition big data a security if you will artificial intelligence markets to infringe give me an example what is that a ... a company like Wal Mart that is about to get Amazon we saw I was on the board of Walmart\nAnd we saw it coming in and famous just brilliant good people and we saw Amazon coming and we could not get out of their way and it took them Twenty one years to have the same pass the market cap of Walmart much valuable company in the world that time\nAnd it took 'em what ...\nFourteen years to pass GM and it took over seven years to pass Tesla the pace of change is changing which such tremendous speed those are technology enabled market transitions in the automotive industry\nOr in the area of retail this is going to happen to every industry so the first thing I said a start up\nAnd I met her in West Virginia or do buy a\nNew Delhi or where Silicon Valley is tell me what the transition is you're working on because you haven't got a transition you're probably not going to be exciting\nExample of a transition in one of your companies that's that you that you were\nAbout security ah here's a phone not it's the only to the best of my knowledge gets announced him are I'd say a safe cases they had the concept of from a company called ... we had Seventeen people when I got an additional him now they're over\nFifty people but you basically side you're African straight into this case and you close it and nobody\nCan tap into your voice or tap in to turn it on your cameras et cetera and much of your audience I Know might be millennials they're going to say well that doesn't bother me\nIt will bother you we can no longer take your smartphone to work because your employer especially if you're in defense or in business isn't going to allow devices that crack spyware so quickly and faces to it so the inflection point is it's transitional cybersecurity done through hard\nAnd this is one Marty that this when I tried to say no to so many times in Canada you my curiosity and and my weakness for dreaming big got the better of me\nAnd we basically are we're at the Clinton Global initiative in member I'm a moderate Republican uh in terms of opposition dangerous species here in California Clinton didn't you didn't you vote for Hillary Clinton you look at that time and I understand that voted for a for a Democrat for president but\nYou're in ... I'm kind of in a tough spot because I Believe strongly and strong defense than a little regulation on business a and a strong education in choice and sexual orientation and immigration are especially high skilled immigration\nSo as I look at this session the Clinton Global initiative I'd been asked to be on a panel with the person who want it three years before and we judge twenty five thousand companies to the top five star ... the top one got a a million dollars and that went down for one for helping to start out\nThe person that was shocked me was the one that won at three years earlier\nWith cricket farming ... I thought that's neat next issue [laughter] watch how he asked a question and then he said John can actually tell you about my company my curiosity got the best of me I said you can tell me\nBut I understand this isn't my sweet spot not invest and I don't understand anything about crickets and farming is nice but don't know a long story short\nAs he got me to understand it was electric and finally it was about Internet of things that was about digital stations about growing critics fifty percent faster it was about saving the planet because you can develop a given amount of protein at one time at the one tenth the environmental damage that we do with me I'm a meat eater and it's a cleaner protein but more effective for your kids than plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse me or that the major thing you have to do is here's the plan to get here you outline division almost right the press release before you make the first move on the jets game and then you your regular report how do we do it\nAnd you bring our nation together with Democrats Republicans say who doesn't want to create jobs their kids why should this be a partisan issue let's get the regulation down which is real problem let's create an environment where start ups have a chance to be successful let's do a student debt which is a real problem for Americans being so deep and dad about the time they would normally do start up\nThere saying how do I get my kids through school\nSo I think that there's probably five to seven things that we can go after aggressively I Hope both parties would do this together I'm an inclusion or a person and uh uh I'm a believer that the only way you can do something this fundamental is for the majority of people in the country to come together behind it\nOne of the things you listed there and that you also emphasizing the book and I've read a quote here from it which says quote in the book by the way it is a is John chambers connecting the dots lessons for leadership and started world but he also looks more broadly including an education he wrote\nThe K. twelve education system in the U.S is broken and in need of dramatic repairs and ... well the U.S spends number one or number two per capita on education in the world yet we score near the bottom among developed nations so it's less of a money question\nThan an ally location questions so now if you were the US's educations are what would be your first crowd sourced edict elaborate or be inclusive leading\nThe asset of as our comes in and do a ... even a present tries to come in and do this they'll get chewed up because of all the issues of an incumbent system that was designed for the past not for the future and I admire what our teachers have done in America and I want to thank them for giving back\nBut we have to redo the whole curriculum system\nAh we we spend that much money are but we do the poorest job many of the textbooks that might have actually you know you might have used during school\nAnd so we have to think about how do you teach entrepreneurship how do you teach education how do you teach technology in a way that's exciting not just something the geeky as over to decide do you got to outline a vision on it and both parties need to come together I think America's ready for this\nAnd I also want to lower the pressure on us if France can do this\nAnd if indeed came with one point three billion people tell me why America the innovation nation in the world can't fix its education system and become a startup nation again\nHere you know I'm not as that that sounds a little to pat for me okay what it's worth\nYou talk about you mentioned in past week we could teach at entrepreneurship well you know\nThe people who tend to go into teaching tend to be very anti capitalist very anti corporate so and have a business sense and the professors who tend to create the K. twelve curriculum also never met a liberal arts didn't like the quadratic equations they like Shakespeare that like the pope and Asian wars and the word entrepreneurship\nFor them as a almost a dirty word mhm how would you try to go but I mean that I Do also believe that ethical entrepreneurship no is ultimately not only a job creator but it is what is enabled that iPhone ... you're talking about as you even the crickets to solve the protein problem in developing nations\nBut how do you get the education system that is lard with anti people who think that entrepreneurship is half what it was pretty much a dirty word what do you do about this well\nSeveral things and and he raised probably a question we can talk about do as just on the question but taking um Canada in reverse order you raised them number one companies have to just do the right thing\nAnd what Cisco did is we were always one of the best of getting back we went every corporate social responsibility a word that was from the Clinton or a secretary of state and President Obama to George Bush in ...\nAlways that look like what we're doing the right thing regarding education reform bill\nOh about a million New Yorker ran right on network academies where they could get a job for where the jobs are going to go in the future\nBut you need to get a small working group together the outline what do we want the outcome to be and you've got to catch the diversity and especially the young women in the second third and fourth grade by the time they get to high school and college it's too late to get in the interest and excitement\nAnd you've gotten to his action figures where it makes the Sicily in terms of what you talk about and then you've got to reward the states or the districts within the states that take the risk\nExcept and you've gotta have courage and ideas are going to feel some of them\nAnd as a society instead of minute one fails everybody jumps on says see I told you it wouldn't work\nBecome a started nation actually a number of them to fail let's go for it and what is the downside of\nThe worst thing you can do is do the right thing to long we are in that case we have nobody to blame but ourself have ten years from now we're not generating twenty five to thirty million jobs a decade in another twenty million to displace the workers that are going to be\nOut of the results of digital station artificial intelligence we know what's coming yet nobody's stepping up the plan now to do it we've come to short term focus [noise] ah I Want\nTo get back to some of them I'm very sensitive to my listeners who all four hour of dealing with their day to day work life issues and all this ... very high minded macro talk may be seen as out of touch so I'm going to get very specific for a moment\nYou said in your book that the Internet of things is going to be a bigger deal than the Internet\nOr in terms of jobs in whatever what should my listeners know about the future of jobs in the world of the Internet of things\nThey're going to be dramatically different than today tell me more let me be realistic you in coal mine in West Virginia even if it comes back and you find a way to clean coal or something like that they're going to be human as much as\nThe equipment whopper rate ah drones will be all over the place it's like at an FAA flight zone in a pet store in in an area so you've got to see wherever the jobs occur and then you've got to train the workforce to get there this is why I Believe to do this when things were trapped in West Virginia", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Work with
