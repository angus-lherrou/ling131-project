{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Tomorrow evening at six on KLW San Francisco [noise]\nYour work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nMost people believe they're ethical and in most black and white ... most people are [noise]\nThere are lots of gray areas and what to do in those situations [noise]\nAlready done it for five common gray area ethical dilemmas that occur in the workplace with some frequency to kick around both sides used my frequent co conspirator other showing on airing ethical person the maverick county superintendent of schools and my wife Dr ...\nAnd do you want to start by describing the first of those five ethical dilemmas\n[noise] sure [noise] um because it's one that I have faced in the past and I know I picked it yeah that\nIs you have an employee who was a an okay work or maybe not a great worker maybe even a little less than that um but they're getting by and then the person is diagnosed with cancer\nAnd start treatment\nAnd because of the treatment ... work performance really falls\nAnd particularly if they are um [noise] bringing in money yes they are a nonprofit in their job is to bring in money and that's not happening then what do you do\nTo you let them go or do you somehow try to cover for them because they need the money\n[noise] okay well we're going we're going to do to your listeners I'm going to or we're going to take turns making an argument pro and con goes the gray areas clearly they wrote who's who made on both sides and then we'll turn to you too you know you could call in and tell us what you think we're simply or think about what you think is was your approach and what you've\nDone your what you've done or maybe we'll upon but first I'm going to make the argument for retaining him I Know you did in your case to retain this person\nOr actually there were several sadly that there were that were at least three that come to mind [noise] anyway\nI'm going to make that argument and then you can make the argument against it and then most will ... come up to who loses a mother listeners away and\nThey're not even for retaining this person would be the most organizations but especially non profits in this case the examples of nonprofit person most of those nonprofits certainly espouse putting people over profits so to let that person go when he's been an acceptable performer and now as to endure treatment for re Kurd cancer\nA chemotherapy or a would be a critical especially since you know he he is in this case is family sole support and you save a little\nUh because he's worked for nonprofits and from a pragmatic standpoint letting him go is going to hurt the regret organizations morale\nAnd besides you with the let's let's just say it's not a stage one cat so which is not an issue but let's say this record and then it's in his lymph nodes it's unlikely that he'd want to or be able to stay employed for very long\nA retaining um would be inappropriate cost of doing business uh okay no Barbie you want to make the argument against retaining\nI think this is an issue that really depends on the particular workplace if you are a non profit and you are providing services to people who are very needy and the absence of\nHis ability to do his job means that many other people are left in a bad circumstance you may not have a choice or if it's at all possible I think you would try to accommodate the person as long as you can\nAh I Know in our case we had various people donate some of their sick days which is that an easy thing to do but again if you our mission is to provide services to people who are in bad shape them really need those services\nThen the only other option would be too I'm kind of change his job so that he's doing something that's less critical and\nThat you may not be able to afford it and sunny and they have to consider the good of the many over the good of one\nUm what I Would do there is try to find out what options there were for disability insurance or maybe even a worker's comp or some thing where he wouldn't the person wouldn't be laughed at without any salary or income\n[noise] okay well I'll tell you what I Would actually do in this dilemma in most situations\nUm\nI like to think that the wisest kindest approaches not to the individual who the person sitting in front of you for example em noting with interest how much of air time and the media is being spent on this one horrendously killed journalist\nWhen there are millions of people dying of other things ... and the media can be such an important vehicle for saving lives in other ways I like to think that I mean that's called utilitarian as him and I would like to think that\nI Would weigh in the situation the benefits of retaining this person\nOr and what would be the negative impacts of course you're right if I could somehow have him trade tasked with somebody else a I Would do that if like you know but I Would be trying to think largely in terms of what's going to yield the most good for the most people\nAnd yeah and then let's see if I decided I needed to terminate I'm a I Would of course explain that to everybody in the workforce so that they understand that is an ethically based in that are just a you know save money based decision\nAnd then I Would do what I could to help him find\nA iffy specially if this family needed the money or find whether it'd be giving him a generous severance package or feel like you said finding appropriate disability services it wouldn't be workers' comp because he got the cancer not because of the workplace probably\nSay no no fly it depends on where the perfect and we're feeling\nYeah if you're at a factory breathing carcinogenic chemicals but he ... and Kelly PA kind of preclude a lot of that's anyway are those are my thoughts are do you want to render your social should we go to the listeners\nI Would be curious to know what listeners have done and the situation\nOkay so are you just heard us make best case arguments are in a very difficult situation in which in a place of employment\nA a K version as not just cancer because stage one or even states too you know it really ... you could ever an awfully long lifespan of productive work\nUh but were let's talk about somebody who's worked performance has declined as a result of the cancer the chemotherapy and maybe it's occurred\nOr do you keep this under what circumstances maybe the more gray area nuanced way to bring it up as in what circumstances would you keep this person under what circumstances would you let this person go what do you think um we welcome your call here at work with Marty Nemko and ...\nThe phone number for one five eight four one for one two three four that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four [noise] let's turn to another ethical dilemma while we're waiting\nFor calls to come in a and this is about a sales person who um is he or she ethically obliged to reveal his products core weakness so to make a specific\nIn a are you selling was a new ... and the prospect of customers coming in and he or she is deciding between a Chevy Cruze and a modest a three\nAnd this customer tells you that reliability is her let's say let's start with his or her as making an awkward her number one criterion in choosing a car she says I hate getting into my\nThe lady of being on the side of the road waiting for tow truck and this person believes that Chevy is more she says you know I I think ... more reliable than Mazda that's why I that's why I'm inclined to to get a Chevy\nBut he was a salesperson I think you're pretty sure she's wrong so you're thinking of checking Consumer Reports about those two specific models and letting the customer know what you find so Barbary make the argument for why the person should check and report back to this customer\n[noise] well I'm not sure that that found person has the obligation\nNot acting you were talking about making the argument for checking in reporting you're right\nI'm not sure that the ... and half the application to check in or\n... yeah that's the argument against I make I'm asking you to make the argument for doing the checking\nOf color you want me to say he really should yeah right and then we'll have a hard time with that ... will do ... or ...\nYou have you have this died that you want to work for a company that um manufacturers cars that are not reliable\nAnd even they already have have taken that step to say okay I'm a sales person I'm going to sell people ... I don't think are reliable and\nFor use if he's come knocking on in the case of the software I say\nIf the car is good and you shouldn't be working\nWell again it's a mixed bag and so we talked about reliable and different features if I'm working for the software company I may not know upfront how bad or good the software which liabilities but I have an obligation to a informed my customers that software missile costs was not expected to notice all can\nCan take the software and ... and why it should be bored or not and if it's overall so horrible yes they should quit the job but I Want to know what listeners think does this sales person have an obligation or less again let's be nuanced\nUnder what circumstances does a sales person have an obligation to disclose negatives not just positive about his or her product\nThe phone number here where we ... the topic is ethical dilemma is in the workplace the phone number for one five eight four one for one two three four that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four let's move on to the next that's supposed to\nSee if we can never get quality because we move\nA scenario and we do have ... I just was we can I can wait for a moment I just\nWe will do let's give a heads up while getting the calls coming we don't screen by the way we're proud of this is truly democratic radio we take calls in the orders that they come in\nSo that you really get to hear people say without us filtering it in any way so All right let's go back to the phones welcome to work with Marty Nemko and ... what is the perspective that you would like\nTo share that share of the perspective\nOf hanging up let's go to the next level [laughter] well that's a perfect\nCertainly it's it's one it's a very clear black and white perspective or in any case would notice going to the phones welcome to work with Marty and Barbara what's on your mind\nAlone if you are you\nThere are a little yellow Marty Hi yeah Hi my name is David I'm from Santa fell by David and uh I I Love your topic\nAgain I have a personal experience with it like to share on the air awesome to your most recent point um my career has been in the uh the mortgage banking world as we know it had some serious\nUm but many of them many of those uh mishaps shall we say we're due to the um the outlook and and I'm Mr ... very very few people\nHowever uh the senior management and the companies that were responsible were also responsible for telling the company like and so my experience up until two thousand and seven\nUm was as a salesperson for an organization that was responsible for a lot of damage and I saw happening um ended up retooling myself with the job\nTo the damage will look to stop and listen to some assuming the damage was a phony out applications for people who weren't qualified to get a loan and not disclosing what the actual costs so it was\nA it was both responsibility of that company to be more disclosing as well as frankly for the uh the the bar or to to make a risk to more responsibly borrow is that fair statement\nUm I Would I Would recommend it to to put in more on the market you are stating earlier as to the responsibility of the company not necessarily the consumer and say this if you're trying to sell negatively advertising adjustable loan to somebody who doesn't understand what that means\nAnd and they are coming in and there are two and a half percent three months later to be six and they don't know what that means and the commission level is high enough to get people to be dishonest is a form of omission\nYou're still committing a heinous that okay and uh some of us can't live with that\nOkay so what you said you read to him\nI said goodbye um I put\nMyself back into the market as a as a salesperson for an equally long terms sales process where there was a lot of um people skills that's what I enjoy about about this and yet it it it was it was where the product and a facility for selling the product\nIt's got to like it you got to believe in it and then have to fit your moral and ethical standards\nAnd that's good for you as an individual but it's also good for this society because that's the creative destruction of capitalism\nIf only people will only sell products that they really believe in then then the only people who sell for ... ... are going to be a sleazy ... bad salesmen and then and those companies will tend to go out of business and that's the good side of capitalism rank\nYes and it's a change that we need to foster even though it's not the right on the horizon for for a lot of our company is these days but I think we can make that change\nI think it's important anyway thank you and call Barbara newcomers should go back to the phones\nNo I I totally agree when you are selling something like a complicated mortgage where we don't expect the consumer to know\nThat hey it's two and a half now but surprise surprise and two months it's going to be six percent that's entirely unethical and I would be right with and I would not have started working for that company and I would not say working for that company\nLet's go back to the phones welcome to work with a quote Robert I'm cold water on which side of which you get to the ... we discussed would you like to opine\nHello you hello Hi\nHi I wanted to make a comment about the sales [noise] um [noise] I think it is partially the consumers due diligence to do some research but I also believe that as a sales person\nI'm I'm hearing on radio 'cause you you turn down your radio please\nOkay sorry about that you know and I think it's very important to actually know your competitors are\nAnd to be aware of that you have some type of food but it happens comparative analysis to truly be able to offer the customer and and you know what what their needs are and and and also while selling the benefit of your product first solution you know I mean how do you know with full confidence that you're giving them the best solution\nLike you say you are unless you know\nAnd that's not true or not is not too much to ask the sales person to understand the competitors and you know while there's no question I Believe in the short run the sleazy sales person makes more money\nBecause they're going to close more sales right away based on not disclosing the negatives but in the long run they will even make more money because they're going to get more word of mouth referrals from satisfied customers were blown away by the fact that this person you know this products that really right for you or\nA minimum there'll be able to put their head on the pillow better at night so it feels like it's got a medic as well as high minded value anyway thanks very much for the call let's bar but let's go to the next of the ethical dilemmas\nAnd this dilemma is um when I got a job seeker is desperate and many of the listeners to this show them and some of them certainly are looking for a job\nAnd when you're desperate the question is is it worth lying to land a job and so Barbara why don't you start by making the argument ah for why is worth\nA ... not lying we're lying I don't know ... make your way to make any argument I make the argument you won't make the other argument [laughter] okay\nUm well let's see just for fun I'll make the argument for saying okay\nSo are you are an employee and your skills are primarily soft skills and\nThe problem and reason that you are having trouble getting a job just because you don't have good technical skills and that kind of what they're looking for so you got by for a long time by being organized and well liked but you can't relate to the job so\nA soft skills are actually a very important part of the job of any job in fact that the one the more common way that people lose their jobs because they don't have the skills they may have the technical skills\nSo if you got hired you might be able to collaborate with your co workers where someone else could help you with the technical part that you're not so good at while you can help them with the skills\nAnd if you don't lie to get the job then you won't have the opportunity to do this because nobody's going to hire you because you have a gap unemployment\nSo therefore since there would be a way to produce for the company and be a good employee how it might be worth doing\nWell first of all of a of course if the job requires technical skills all the soft skills in the world they're not going to you know you can dance around and get help but then you're being you're applying for a job is to go so that makes that argument but makes that week but I Want to make the general argument against lying\nYou are first of all being unfair to the honest job applicant who through your clever successful lying\nI'm would be denied the job you know I ... and yeah it's possible that that person may need the job but less than you do but that's far from certain so even if you're desperate also if you've not been selected despite months and months of trying\nIt suggests that you may not be as worthy an employee as you think even in terms of the social skills\nIt's wise or to look inward and say why the hell it by not gotten employed in ten months of hard trying\nAnd then either decide you're going to improve your skills or change careers to one in which you would be more readily hired or simply a lower level job and your career this to you know it is not even borderline or that there's no way you should be lying\nCan you slowed that you're talking a little fast and because your accent a little difficult to speak right into the phone and speak a little more slowly please\nShut 'em what you make enough money or they theorized that you can support your says I Know\nThat that seems to be quite a reasonable arguments\nYou know uh I have no ... no I could I could see that being said the only argument against it is to say let's say you for argument's sake let's say or do you speak with an accent so I'm assuming from another country and so you have additional cultural and linguistic competence\nAnd I would imagine that there are people who are struggling in your country and instead of owning the party favorites thing where you're selling hasn't horns\nYou were doing something to improve the lives of the struggling people in your country isn't that more ... a wise or use of the heartbeat of your life and so in the party favors\nYes but what if I if I can vote to even off my country okay and then maybe use that money to a game for the people in my country or even the people here because\nI'm inside all day and it's not that hot and I get on the mission ie the village you drink something for her\nAnd then then I Would like\nBut the money that I\nWent back and they wouldn't have even more than\nI Am honored by your call and we all are lines are lighting up so I Want to thank you for the call barbers anything you want to say you should go right back to the phones I think let's go right back from the phone welcome to work with Marty and Barbara what's on your mind\nHi Marty and Barbara um I did I did appreciate what you had to say about uh ethics in the workplace\nOr having bump heads with ah the number two person an HR all large ah agency I'm but going to the uh the party favors\nI Want you to know that I'm sitting at my desk [laughter] and I am wearing mine the lush lobster hat [laughter]\nWhich I bought a farm community thrift on Valencia straight okay and what I'm going to do with what I think I'm going to call it Lawrence lobster\n[laughter] um that was a lot of different Saturday Night live I remember that segment go ahead\nWhy don't I don't I don't remember that I just thought Lawrence would be a a dignified name for it\nNo he was a John Belushi was holding this live lobster and for the boiling pot [laughter] it or not I mean we're please go ahead\nAnd I thought it was an ethical to put into a boiling pot of water anything that was the life that you knew my name's ... I'm Sorry yes yes absolutely husband wife or anything [laughter]\nBut um it's going to find a home at eight twenty six Valencia with the pirates store [noise] and um because of course pirates need lobsters\nNear total pirates like a fish ... right but\nBut in terms of the store if that's how you're going to be able to make a living that's not a bad thing as long as you know you know you you do your civic stuff are there other ways to to to to show that absolutely absolutely\nAre in fact the fact that there are thrift stores that benefit um\nThe community allows us to get our frivolous and not so frivolous stuff and say you know when I'm finished with this um I Will bring it over to this place because I Know they'll put put it to good use\n'em and and please don't be jealous I'm sure there's another Lawrence lobster hat out\nFor you [laughter] you're just going to have to find it thank you very much\nNot horrible and of course even better in a thrift store you make it affordable to people as well as supporting a non profit or we're just we're we're trying we you know because public radio listeners are lofty in their ideals we're trying to we're looking at dilemma is\nYou know and and is who is who is lived a better life the person who is working\nI'm too you know to improve human kind more broadly or the person who's selling party hats and um that's what we're exploring\nBob or anything you want us to address you go back to the phones\nI Want to know where I get that out there are a lot [laughter]\nAnyway let's go back to the phones welcome to work with muddy and bribery what's on your mind\nHello it's you yeah hello Hi Hi yes I'm\nI've been kind of on a losing streak in terms of interviews in the last August or so if I had a bunch of interviews for a when a last August and the day and\nHis August or last August meaning two thousand Seventeen of two thousand eighty\nA thousand Seventeen show over a year okay and I've been on a losing streak I Can't quite close on a fairly working in a job that uh [noise] uh\nPaying me you know ... far below what I mean\nA lot my potential is what I've learned in the past yeah I've been trying to get another job and can't seem to Clinton hill\nOkay so let's let's let's trouble shoot so um first of all have you done with Barbara is is just earlier have you tried at least\nGet some honest feedback from the employers as to why they didn't elect you\nI have a some some have said uh you know just very vague\nThing a as usual in these days\nRight very vague you know others have said oh yeah there's an internal candidate you know something I mean it's not very how\nCrap no it's not useful or anything but nothing you so nothing useful\nNo not okay I'll give you a multiple choice then which is a following feels like the most likely source of the problem number one you have been adequately in the interview demonstrate that you're you know very good at what you do for actually stories or going to the white board or showing work samples\nUm will stick them one at a time to what extent do you believe you've done a good job of demonstrating you have to be God but you're pretty darn good at what the what the job requires a by telling those stories et cetera\nBut I I I think I have good stories but maybe a I'm over talking perhaps I'm just going on for too long a that's a great one I look up at the uh people I'm Talking to the idea of rolling their eyes so\nWhat is it a length of time now there I always tell people that know as the um the fall of the traffic like rule during the first thirty seconds of another into lights green second thirty seconds it's yellow they're willing you are ready ready for your shut up and up to sixty second markets read you better shut up because you probably overwhelming them are boring them\nBut it's some so sometimes that if you're talking significantly more than a minute at a time\nOr you're not being concise enough but it also could be what you're safe there rolling their eyes that's usually not the length of what you're saying are you saying things that seem cliched or obvious or or or clearly wrong do you know\n[noise] um I don't think so I mean I think um [noise] you know a lot of water either panel interviews and you have to\nYou know the cat questions are can didn't I I just think maybe I don't know I'm just not to [noise] you know understand anything on I mean I've come and uh you know second or third in some cases but you know that's not a after me over the top\nYou sounding a little flat is that possible because usually when people come on the radio there were a little nervous of their eggs or energy levels actually Hi I'm Wondering whether you\nUm [noise] I don't know I I\nI I really don't know so let's let's test it out what kind of job you searching for\nI'm\nSearching for a a job in the public sector institution us you know the panel interview\nDoing what what kind of job in the public sector\n[noise] um [noise] a marketing\nMarketing in the public sectors and nonprofit marketing kind of thing or government marketing of particular uh you know drug programs or more welfare programs or whatever like\nThat right yeah okay so I'm gonna I'm On the interviewing him asking a question well tell me about an example in the past in which you have marketed a nonprofit of governmental program [noise]\nUh yeah so uh in the past I've ah marketed a federal programs in the past such as my last position I um [noise]\nI took the ... an opportunity to market a a program in which a governmental or to bring public support for mental projects and programs which were I'm OK to increase the transportation programs\nCan can you be specific tell me about this specific transportation for what you did to market it\nUh\nYeah so well you know I mean already I I think already kind of flubbed them flip the delivery on that\nOne of those little ... I Want to take warm I Want to get more data here before I get rid of my opinion as Barbara do the same of course I'm so tell me more about what you specifically did to market that transportation what did you do to market that transportation initiative\nWell for example I'm a there was a a ... which are trying to um [noise] get\nA increase attendance over the past year um and uh when I took over a a publicity uh for this campaign to mark this particular our friends I was able to increase attendance by five or forty percent over the previous\nWhere did you do what specifically what did you do to to enable that forty per se that's a big increase what did you do specifically [noise]\nUm I was in charge of the publicity after it's a it's a outreach or we did a ah we did um email blasts a cause I'm you know created a ... a marketing collider all et cetera that are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Work with Marty Nemko", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
