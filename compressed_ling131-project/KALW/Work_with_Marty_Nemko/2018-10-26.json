{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Your work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nHave to start with an apology I announced last week that I'd be speaking about career change at UC Berkley extension alas all the seats are now sold out spoken for what the good news is there as a result\nThey're gonna be making a a pod cast doubt on and I will announce on the show what the link will be for that but those you hope to register it actually\nRock stars but any case it happens a lot of people wanting change careers I guess with the uh the good employment market people are feeling more confident they can afford to make a career change but any case to today's number one topic\nCareer do's and don'ts for parents of college students a couple of weeks ago I was honored to be speaker in a a Stanford distinguish speaker series was offering advice to Paris to Stanford students\nAnd I thought I Would share with your version abbreviated version of what I said but it's still take about Fifteen minutes but I think I decided it's worth your time\nOf course it's applicable not just a parents of college students let alone Stanford students but anyone who cares about them and a lot of the advice I'm certainly much of it that I Want to share with you that in the edited version I'm going to tell you\nIs um relevant whether you're Seventeen or Seventy seven anyway\n[noise] but I Want to start with how much should parents help the American societal norm is that after high school you're supposed to let your kid fly or crash pretty much solo but at least in my experience on average more parental involvement is wise\n[noise] and you might sort of common cause your kids going to be expecting you to lay off when they go off to college\nAh or is or if they're in college but you might start a conversation as a parent by saying something to your kid like of course I'm proud of what you've accomplished and and it's right now you get more autonomy but for what it's worth your only Nineteen so\nHaving been on this or is a bit longer than you have a may still have something to offer you so I Would like to continue being your advisor I mean you're the now the godfather but I Would welcome welcome remaining a constantly every\nWhat do you think and then the next thing you got to do is listen movie thoughtfully to your kids' response and really listen and then then adjust the extent of your involvement accordingly\nNow turned to ways that a parent might be helpful to the kid regarding their career first assault with a major\nHelping the kids choose the major contrary to conventional wisdom it's usually wise to tentatively choose a career early after only a modest amount of exploration for example you might have your child may be with you alongside\nPeru's his or her colleges list of majors and then click through to any majors of interest and examined the required courses elective courses and the descriptions of careers that major could lead to\nThat simple little thing is more thorough than most kids do because every college easily as a hundred majors or whatever\nAnd it's a fast way to um to screen all of them with some kids just they tend to think they think of two or three or four and they just do that but there are many that are less obvious a gang one of my main themes is always under the radar and that's a nice way\nTo get to some under the radar majors which could lead to under the radar careers which might not be so competitive to land a job now with regard to choosing a career\nI've simple in my judgment way to do this is to Peru's the categorize list a three hundred and forty careers and self employment ideas\nThat are profiled that my new book careers for dummies and then just read the you know half a dozen doesn't\nUh two dozen profiles of only just like a third of a page long or read the profiles of any of those careers that are interesting ah you might particularly call your kids' attention to again under the radar courage for example and give you some examples\nLet's say that your child is not particularly technical here or something they might consider program evaluated so many ... so much of our jet a general a domestic product\nIs um distributed by grants each one of them using needs and evaluate or it's a fun way to learn a little bit about a lot of careers on the other\nA man writing a grand to get some of that money again gets enables you to constantly be involved the innovation it's really fun\nAnother example of a nice under the radar career for an technical person his political campaign manager a lot of people think about being a politician\nBut boy is it interesting to be involved in a political campaign it's up people management it's data management it's the excitement it's exciting it's visionary um it's dealing with some unscrupulous behavior uh on the other part in ... and resisting the temptation of you to do the same I've been watching\nA particular race um I'm not going to tell you what it is because uh anyway uh in education as is something I Know about and it it's dispiriting to see how low they these educators who should be high minded I Will go but I digress a if your child is more technical\nHere's some under the radar careers they might consider forensic accounting that is seeing whether companies are stealing from another our employees is doing from the company and so on forensic accounting\nOr researching the biological basis of reasoning skills we using his prerequisite just so much success especially our information economy being an orthodontist a lot of people think about being a dentist but in North of John this is an unusually rewarding career and quite lucrative\nOr if you know so many people who are technical wanted develop apps well there's some areas that really could use some great apps when an ... an apt to improve your memory for normal people or people with Alzheimer's\nOr a better better out through reducing anxiety we live in the anxiety era\nThere are certainly mindfulness another kind of anxiety reducing apps but they're\nThey're you know they have their limitations\nSo developing better ones would have tremendous applicability or an app that would improve the quality of matches on dating websites a number of my clients for example use tinder or they'll use okcupid or coffee meets bagel or old match dot com or J. date\nAnd they're they're really quite limited in terms of the matching paradigms it seemed like there really is an opportunity do a really rigorous analysis of what makes a match really work\n[noise] and I want to share some other future resistant careers um and what I call future resistant as these careers that are unlikely to be automated or off shored\nThe aforementioned politician up to the campaign a politician and offshore and that being a nurse I'm not I'm less sanguine about being an empty because I really do believe we will have single payer within a few years and because of that if we're trying to cover everybody paid for by taxpayer dollars\nMost of the work is going to be have to be done by less costly practitioners than MDs and so I think the the market for for nurses going to be huge and the range of things I'll be able to do so they're not just under the thumb of a doctor or will be enormous [noise] um I also think some other future resistant careers will be\nBeing a manager who specializes in remote workforces\nThere were so much work that is going to be done offshore and somebody who can manage culturally diverse and geographically diverse uh workers and motivate them uh I think we'll be invaluable I also think any field specially in management related to genetics\nAnd to cyber security and biosecurity will be in great demand\nLarge equipment repair you can offshore the repair of an MRI machine to India\nUm so being if your hands on kind of person large equipment repair\n[noise] um I'm just on medical you know there are these printing presses including three D printing presses MIT is already built houses out of ... D printed freely printed walls\nSo I really think and you know that there will be a high maintenance required for these pretty ... because there's so much liquid being spewed out those jets are going to get clogged et cetera so\nBeing somebody who can do large equipment repair it will be in demand ah I also think that we're we're ever more graphically oriented\nArtist types but graphic design people who have business expertise who will know what they're pretty pretty graphics are actually going to result in people either buying more or donating more to the non profit or whatever [noise] um I think big ticket sales will be relatively future proof\nI'm Talking about everything from skyscrapers the airplane leases\nUm and also judges in hearing officers though they're not going to get off shored very rewarding and ... are a whole panoply of consultants counselors and coaches so those are some future resistant careers that as a parent if you are working with your child to encourage your child to consider under the radar careers\nI think that's a strong idea now there's so many people who say we might view askance to what I've just said there because they think that it's a mistake to specialize early I understand that remaining a generalist is comforting\nBut often it is worth committing to becoming excellent in one narrow area not only is that gonna make you in demand\nYou're going to gain confidence from knowing that narrow area cold and if you're tired of it it's often easier to branch out and be successful in a new niche because you've developed reputation in your first niche for example\nLet's say your kids a physics or chemistry major and decides to become expert in his watched a lot of CSI expert in you know blood splatter accident a brief flat it but then after a while gets bored with it\nI tried to remain calm and I made the case what libertarian policies may at least no guarantees but may be best for all people\nBecause I was statesman like the protests faded and the organization was allowed to continue so that's a ... story that was the ...\nA political organization the approach that she took very statesman like the positive result is that the protests diminished by the way while we're on interviews another useful Internet ... interview technique is when you get asked a question who's answer you could diagram\nYou might ask if you can go to the white board to show how you would structure approach to the problem that's very memorable it's assertive without being a noxious and it it it makes it makes your explanation clear and also you as you were writing and you can be clarifying your own thoughts to about the complex problem [noise]\nNext someone turned to what a parent can do to encourage their child to make the most him an internship your kid has worked hard already gotten the internship now when I'm going to say now may seem obvious because\nBut but because I've seen even some top students fail at this it can't hurt for me to remind your child for you to remind your child that your kids should treat even an unpaid internship as an audition for a job and an example may help here I was on the today show\nAnd in addition to the director and camera people\nThey was very large studio almost brings a football field\nAnd he was filled with two dozen a twenty to twenty two year old I guess around that women yeah and they're all women will leave to another day why that is and whether that's good or bad but anyway most of them were chatting with each other but one of the women was striding from guests to guest\nFrom the camera person to the director and to the host clearly trying to be helpful to every one of them well when my segment was over I told I walked over\nAnd I told her that I was impressed with her industrious and she said you know it's funny you should say that our summer internships just about over and I was the only one of the twenty three to be offered a job after graduation as a producer\nSo I'm your kid all students have got to think of their internship as an audition unfortunately it's an audition and which only a small percentage of the audition has get cast\nYou might want to also talk to get a little bit about particular extra curricula is it a career as a member of my talk is about career do's and don'ts for parents to college students\nYou might encourage extra curricula that are going to your profession and grow then personal growth here a few examples you might want to explore with your kid to start a club or an activist group or create content for a campus newspaper radio station TV station website\nOr get your kid to encourage your kids consider being a student member of the faculty Senate or the student government\nAgain depending on your kids preference you know it's perfectly appropriate to sprinkle their life with pure de stressors\nYou know I remember when I was in graduate school at Berkeley I went to lots of college basketball games and football games even joined the campuses intramural bowling league\nSo you know there's times sometimes have veggie out especially when you're in college not all about career and work but since my topic was about helping your child was career that was my main focus but I I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the value of fun anytime and your life but especially\nWhen you're in college and um but speaking of what I Need to say and I did say this at Stanford to the parents I don't know how they felt about it but\nI I felt they needed to say a word about drugs\n[noise] the legalization of marijuana has created a certainly a second alcohol or worse\nAccording to the recent met a valuation by the national Academy of sciences of the one hundred most rigorous studies of marijuana's affects this is not right wing political reefer madness crap\nAs a result of that medical valuation of the hundred most rigorous studies of marijuana's affects its effects on mental health and physical health and in turn which affects career and personal life are much greater than the often big tobacco funded we'd advocates would have us believe\nYour kid either because your kid knows it maybe you're a user or because if your kid is a user\nIt can generate did make the kid very defensive so my best shot at it in as generic advice\nIs that you show your kid that summer there the summary section of that met as I can just Google it met evaluation National Academy of Sciences marijuana you'll find it and see showing the summary\nAnd then simply ask what do you think and then try maybe usually let it go unless you're really worried and of course you can have a similar discussion about alcohol or or or stronger substances\nAnd finally is where I ended my talk at Stanford is um [noise] I um I told people that I've had the privilege of having been career and personal cost fifty five hundred people including some of the most successful people on earth as well as some real stragglers\nAnd while intelligence and drive or the number one and number two differentiating factors\nNumber three is that successful ones are more likely to follow my Holocaust survivor dad's advice\nWhen I asked him why so rarely talked about the Holocaust he said Martin the Nazis took five years from my life I won't give them one minute more he said Martin stop looking back\nAlways take the next step forward\nAnd that's how I ended my talk or to stand for parents I like to think that maybe it was worth the the twenty five minutes I've just spent a sharing that with an abbreviated version with you um but now I'd like to go to the phones if you especially are the parent or somebody if you've got a college kid in your life somebody you care about\n[noise] and you would like to ask questions about their future career their existing ... if they're there they're existing\nWeren't anything related to career for a college student in graduate school student on how to help them launched their career better or already readjust um that's particularly a value of course you've got any career question I'm pleased to to answer the phone number here at work with Marty Nemko for that call them work overs is for one five\nEight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four\nAnd as well if you have any comments you know I'm like I I did it for securing a ah at my at Stanford talk and there were lots of good questions if you've got a question about what I said earlier comments that's also welcome the phone number again ... W and work with Marty Nemko four and five\nEight four one for one three for\n[noise] um those are viewer regular listeners to the show no that I uh I Believe in tweeting\nUm since two thousand nine I have posted five thousand one hundred and sixty tweets as of today and they and the reason I like doing it because they are ... my best ideas\nAnd um periodically on this show I share what I think the best and most relevant to career and I'm going to ... I'm going to share the best of the current\nCrop but as usual my priorities you might get a listener so I'll go up the phone number and they go right to the phones if you have a question about your career especially if you ah have a a question about a a college student or graduate school student who you care about who's in your life or you're one\nOf course if you're a college graduate student anything related to your career directly or indirectly fair game the phone number for one five eight four one for one three for what's that the number four cinema or for what I call that work over here in K O W N this show work with Marty Nemko for one five\nEight four one for one three four and now to the phones welcome to the show and it's your turn on the air what's on your mind\n[noise] um my name is Benjamin I have a daughter just started college or high school she was studying it attacked mostly [laughter]\nAnd listening to your discussion of future proved job and I kinda think that will work as kind of future pre position but but maybe you could share your your opinion there\nI'm agnostic or one of my axiom is is that any job where the work product can be sent over the Internet\nWill be sent to low cost countries and there is no especially as ever more information ever more what used to be you know printed documents or you know used to be microfiche locally you know so much is digitized now and the\nI mean are kind of short that that does include some things that are just like straight paper but there's there's other things that you might find in in in an archive that\nI'm an of borderline art objects and things like that\nThat or in the case of um my father who works at a museum where she's dealing with actual artifacts that are not really despite quality but are there for research purposes\nMuch of that again is did you can get digitize so if I Am running a museum in this case here in San Francisco that moment in the cause of hiring a or are convinced in America might be eighty thousand a year\nPlus benefits rights of trauma nation it sets et cetera and I can get a low level in turn to digitize all of those OJ dart\nAnd for a cat for character is for a categorization is creating systems for record keeping\nCertainly some of it of course some of it has to be done locally and understand that\nBut I worry that it to larger percentage could be digitized and off shored so I'm more nervous about that than a career that cannot as like for example as I mentioned things like program evaluation politician medical equipment repair\nBut right now I'm hearing a little echoing have you turn down your radio\nYes sir okay good please go ahead so you're an award winning writer I there is kind of was that can we can you please repeat\nThat I'm an award winning writer and author owner of a company called ... which is okay ... magazine called kind of this business cards I say I take great average and your advice as your caller regarding a tobacco or\nIn the middle of the opioid epidemic I I don't think that the younger generation the ... have you tell them out of this kind of us is set and ready to be probably the tech industry a multi billion dollar industry you all ... states ultimate countries have legalized\nAnd I'm going to interrupt you because it's all out back for the show the shows about careers I'm not going to hear a we're not going to get in a debate about cannabis thank you for the\nCall has all the lines of letter that let's go back to the phones welcome to work with Marty Nemko your turn on the air how can I help you\nOkay and it's at Miami it is you hello\nHi okay it's a sign of San Diego state taking civil engineer okay I was I was wondering if it's your turn out or is that going to go find a way computers or wherever\nI don't think so I mean it's ... for example some areas of civil engineers will likely to continue to be useful for civil engineers and woman who have done on very major construction project\nAnd I really don't do things that it's clear you know given the you know maybe it's because I sit and good luck to get takes me over an hour to get here are the ten miles from my home in Oakland to to the studio [laughter]\nNo no we're not building more freeways but there's clearly going to be a commitment to more mass transit because\nJust untenable people can't move people can't go anywhere they get to work I can see their friends they can't sing [laughter] right so I Believe that a civil engineer who specializes\nHe's in in in a vector victories the direction of vector that is clearly we're society's headed especially here in the bay area in California more broadly\nI Will do fine but I that's where I talk about early specialization I don't think there's anything wrong with civil engineering but I Would rather than thinking about civil engineers you know building you know I'm more bridges more roads more ah buildings I Would try to focus is specialize early she he or she can always change\nIf it doesn't work but I Would start by trying in his or her field work\nIn their term papers in their projects whatever to for example specializes in I'm In ... in mass transit like you know light rail or whatever it is that makes sense\nYeah it's great All right thanks a lot of people\nJust see where you know what's her background [laughter]\nWell so what you know of course every kid as I mentioned earlier every kid who's interested in ... say in a field as a civil engineering\nShould simply soured by ... on the on your column the kids' college website there is going to be a section for civil engineering and there's going to be usually a section and says careers that civil engineers can do\nBut that's the starting place but then after that there's no reason why he or she shouldn't simply put in quotes civil engineering and then careers and you will in the first Google Search results you will find both text\nAnd videos that are going to expose him or her to a wide range of options that go well beyond what what you might have thought of does that make sense\n... thanks so much You're welcome back to the phones welcome to work\nMarty Nemko it's your turn on the air how can I help you\nThank you um [noise] I've been a reluctance to call for a while now because I'm a little bit afraid of uh what you might\nSay okay I'll Try to be nice uh but I'll be happy to be honest one thing I have to do is beyond well saying that you're a straight\nShooter and I appreciate that I don't always agree with with what you say but I I think you're you're really I appreciate your honesty I Do draw um here's the situation I I'll be fifty in a few months mhm\nI'm looking at a career change mhm I'm and I'm realizing it's a lateral move and I'm financially being completely honest it doesn't make a lot of sense [laughter] um it's something that I find rewarding and I'm\nA I'm getting a lot of encroachment timing it feels like it could it could be very gratifying\nPeacefully they tell me what you're doing now and tell me what you're trying to ... I\nI work as an interpreter I've been working as an interpreter for a mere ... almost Twenty years now\nForeign language sign language what what kind of interpreted\nBy a court interpreting\nCorporate okay great\nYeah so you know it's it's given me you know pensions some security to the degree that that any job of securities based like you know um and the practical thing for me to do it would be to finish up my time with my court service than a retire if\nIt's a that's not entirely satisfying to me and I'm interested in speech pathology um\nI went back and I got a second degree in speech pathology I'm looking at grad school ...\nThe reality is that going back to grad school means going without an income for three years there's an opportunity costs to that yeah and once I'm done with that um even in the best case scenario I Am looking at um not increasingly earning potential over what I'm I'm currently pursuing\nDecreasing it perhaps yeah and you were fifty four year old ... speech therapy is competing with people in their twenties and thirties and much as we don't like to admit it is you know it's not respects against you but but being a newbie ... one strike\nAgainst you well I I should say that that I mean this when I was looking at what after things I might do it does feel like this is a field where my age might not count against me but it might be an asset\nIf you're dealing with the ... their speech therapist who work with stroke patients yeah an older people on your age and\nWe have our I'm doing volunteer hours in rehab center it's great I really liked the population in ... indigent care if it feels right okay I'm On that kind of social personal level\nHave you had done a thorough search to find if there are programs you could do depending on your economic situation how much you that opportunity costs lost income during those three years or their part time night a weekend or what are called a synchronous programs that can be done twenty four seven you could doom and you you know in your pajamas at midnight\nHave not and there were no search about whether the yeah ... and\nThey're they're really not the strongest programs and I think it's going to be pretty much a full time commitment for three years and then we'll be very little limited opportunity um for outside work\n... defining strongest\nNot to say they're not destroying these programs to find that for him because that could well different things\nOn it I I I question the academic rigor of some of the programs I think at the undergrad level perhaps there would be good on line programs available that what I Would pursue that if I were in that position but for the graduate work it doesn't really\nSeem to me that particularly with this kind of work with so much of it is about rapport building working directly with with clients\nUm I think it really needs to be in person\nMight come to an might tend to uh\nDismissed those so quickly as somebody very familiar with quote rigorous programs rigor is not necessarily defined by practical utility that ability if you say you and you're correct so much of what working with any patient is or any client is understanding the psychology getting them unstuck getting them motivated\nThat is something that is more likely to be taught well by a master practitioner then by somebody who would be a faculty member at a quote rigorous university at UC Berkeley or San Francisco state you know where to eat where research in theoretical work is so central to their hiring and promotion\nSome of these NO NAME places\nMight indeed have mastered practitioners places that crappy you know did don't like National University sounds terrible right but National University very often will hire and I don't know I don't know you know if they have a program on speech pathology\nBut they have um they hire master practitioners who may be better for training you on how to develop that report or in the day in the ins and outs than than professional ... um am I missing something here\nNo I think you might be ... generally speaking but I think and with with speech and particular um I don't doubt that the progress like have great faculty but I I don't think that I'm going to get what I'm looking for\nOkay because I Want push out looking for it even those online programs have plenty of field work in internships as supervised work where you're getting that in person work I'm just trying to avoid you're spending three years of no income\nAnd in classes that may in fact be more theoretical I Can't tell you how many people who have gone to Ivy League schools for let's say you know medical schools talking about something just really practical and how much they learned that his irrelevant to the day to day practice of being great with their patients\nI I get that completely I see that up so I guess the issue of practicality as if that's foremost on my mind because it's like I started out in art school [laughter] with my first study so I don't I don't mean to go to art school again\nThere's two kinds of practicality there is which career is likely to be your income and then there's the practicality of instruction and they're the people who are professors at ... at Berkeley in Stanford or whatever", "show_name": "Work with Marty Nemko", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "26"}
