{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy birthday to David we struck you would have been a hundred and ten today they're performing Shasta coaches violin concerto number one in a minor opus Ninety nine which was written for him and on which he in some ways collaborated with ...\nWhose birthday it was just a couple of days ago that's a Carnegie Hall um recording\nFrom Nineteen fifty six with Dimitri metropolis in the New York philharmonic\nDeepest we struck on the violin [noise] you're listening to K. A. L. W. San Francisco and I'm Syracuse with you every Sunday evening except for the next to Sunday evenings David let me will be hosting here\nAnd a reminder that tomorrow night explorations in music starts with shots to coach part to do like to eat the host Robert Greenberg any Alexander string quartet and starting with the\nPiano trio an e minor\nHope the sixty seven from Nineteen forty four I don't know quite how will make the transition between Dimitri ... Elizabeth Baker but we're going to uh have her on the phone in about\nTen minutes she has this very intriguing album called called ... that has just come out electronics piano toy piano lots of uh\nLots of instrumentation and it's on band camp and various platforms so let's begin before we talk with her\nBefore I talk with her let's begin with his head space and I don't know if we'll have time to listen to the whole thing I'll be speaking with her and about eight minutes or so had space by Elizabeth speak\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou've taught in schools you mentioned your classical guitar background you're visual artists published author you published ... books and had a guard dog and you're still relatively young are you in your twenties\n[noise] I just turned thirty in August\nOh congratulations that's great congratulations\nSo you prefer to be called a new renaissance artist can you explain what that means\n[noise] so I look at it as rented the renaissance\nIs a state of constantly learning and re creation and re bird\nAnd knew because I didn't want people to think of the renaissance fair and turkey leg mhm um and then of course artists because ultimately everything is art and everything I Do is art and\nThat kind of made sense to me and so that was the term that made more than than like multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary artists\nRight right and it all goes together as it doesn't this on this album\nAnd when you create your own label then you don't have to deal with the expectations\nThat everyone else has so you can define you can define how you want\nBut isn't this on another label dishes and this was on but no I mean the label of\nOh yes yes yes exactly yes um\nWe spent time together last December at your home it was really wonderful and you your hospitality we talked a lot about music your mother is British she's a black woman your father's black men from Florida you have both conservatives and liberals and your family and I'm interested in this complex background with\nUh all these elements work and the fact that there are relatively few black women in experimental music and I noticed affects your experience out in the world but I Wonder if it affects your music\nI Know you work a lot with text and some of this is sort of don't within\nIn text but ah\nYeah does does it have an effect on your music\nOr I think every experience today has has an effect on my music uh particularly a lot of my electronic stuff because I work on my electronic music at night if\nI work on my piano music by day and my electronic music finite so uh I'm In my studio and it's like for blackout curtains\nAnd it really is like the time for me to sit with my little at is involved in my family and rocks and and just sort of met its heat on\nThe things that have happened during the day things that I'm I'm thinking about from like a scientific point of view or personal point of view and so for me a lot of my electronic stuff is like a phonics meditation ... ritual and\nFrom there specifically 'cause you just played heads the heads we started off as a sonic ritual for me to sort of process all of these emotions that we are going on that I didn't quite know how to speak about with other people\n[laughter] not I mean I don't know learning stuff about\nIt [laughter] you know I look at pieces and I think I Know what it's about but then it it's sort of flipped on me and I think about it in different ways and there's always something new that I'm worried about myself in my music\nSo even what I thought about at seven months ago is on the thing I think about it a now so it's\nIt's really interesting and and not plays into you know the piano he is um which is the only piece that uh I did not write the one that was written by Nathan quarter oh so he wrote that for me a few years ago and um\nI we now call it and we now see that it's in it's toddler stage\n... because when I first started performing it it requires a like a very like sure performers to command the amount of space the various Feldman lot like be Thirteen minutes pi I'm\nSo at first I was very afraid and I was counting for my life and now it's just it's actually really meditative and um I've been working on traffic memories so I'm\nActually seen 'em sock shave right next to try out memories and then I leave my practice space and and just this wonderful chills oh\nYeah yeah and Nathan quarters a composer here and we're working with and are collaborating with and you'll be here in January um talk in the studio and you use your mother's voice in lateral seizes beat frequency such such\nGreat to be able to use her voice it's yes yeah\nI'm really excited because I'm I'm working on my third book right now um which is called the resident white\nAnd it's um it's all like a motivational book with some places for people to do personal reflection and I talk about what I've learned from the craziness that is my life um [noise] and all of the wonderful for stories I have and all these different things\nUm and my mom will actually be doing the e book or the audio book rather so everyone gets to listen to my mother's pleasant British voice\nAnd the great oh my story\nIs wonderful and your own voices is on some of these um tracks also on the quad with him so where did the title come from quad with him\nSo ... is the last book in the medieval\n... wage curriculum so to speak or there's the trivia and and then the ... which covers number theory geometry um\nMusic and I'm losing some things\nRight now [laughter] it's thirty at night they're so yeah\nYou know but it's a ... and if the book that lives in my studio ... it's a book that I turn to quite often when I'm looking for inspiration um I really enjoy it because\nThere are incredible visuals about music so lateral fees isn't the frequency is actually has visual component to it that we don't normally think of like when we're looking at music I mean now we\nDo because we have specter grams and stuff but you know to think of back then were\nAppreciating scientist thing but\nYeah it's interesting to look at tuning series from that time and that sort of um\nMusic of the fears philosophy and so on will do yeah that's wonderful so your album available now it's on the air okayed label and people can also find lots of information on your website which is I think the
