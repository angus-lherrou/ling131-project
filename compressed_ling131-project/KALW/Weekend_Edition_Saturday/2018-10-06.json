enough to confirm him for the lifetime position yesterday protesters filled the halls of the capital and all eyes were on a few senators who hadn't reached their final judgment\nDecision for\nThe Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona will bring about a week long delay in the confirmation process to allow for additional investigation by the FBI and accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh fellow Republicans reluctantly agreed that the delay\nInhale the FBI secret report as an exoneration Democrats called the investigation incomplete and unfair\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat\nThat was Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York who helped lead the fight against the nominee\nNo matter a pivotal vote by Senator Flake turned the tide he announced that barring some major new development he'll vote to confirm Kavanaugh today\nSo we'll Senator Susan Collins of Maine she took the Senate floor for more than forty minutes to explain why she'll vote for him even though she found Christine gloves before a debate believable\nI only\nThat she is says buy her a sexual assault and that fits trauma has ... and her life never\nThe labs that for when and said she name could not corroborate any of the fence that evening gathering where she says the U.S all a car\nI Believe Dr Ford West

something happened to her [noise]\nAnd ... correspondent Scott Detrow has been covering this whole week Scott thanks very much for being with us or haven't been any doubt but the today's vote is a done deal\nThere have been a lot of twists in the story so I'm not going to say anything is a hundred percent certain but yes we know that Brett Kavanaugh has the votes to be such a confirmed to the Supreme Court today we had been tracking for key undecided senators all along\nAnd yesterday three of them said they would in the end vote for Kavanaugh that's Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Joe Manchin who's the only Democrats supporting I'm Lisa Murkowski ended up being the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh's nomination\nIs I don't have to tell you or anyone at this point this confirmation has been so a contentious you were in the rooms where it happened to twist a line from ah from Hamilton uh what was your reaction like all over the capital when Susan Collins a Republican Joe Manchin a Democrat announced their support Kevin Oh\nI think the best way to describe the reaction was visceral on the building was filled with protesters all week leading up to yesterday or the key senators

Supreme Court today\nThis despite what we can imagine to be the objections of his fellow Democratic senators and what we know to be some very vocal objections of protesters who gathered at the Capitol Hill a Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist group\nBoss babes in that state as Wilson thanks so much for being with us\nThanks for having me\nAnd what's your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for judge capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not the first uprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated\nAlso I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator Manchin is just reflecting the Democratic we'll expressed by the people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabinet people mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um\nUp for reelection and thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you choose a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection yeah\nOf course and I did do that to him yesterday on Thursday\nWill tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Sunday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go well on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual assault and\nAsk them how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but I got back from like ... you you feel like\nYou were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if the judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers and two\nAre fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other option Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kinda surely doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nHis old camp though this is your opinion with me underscore is my ...\nOf course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if your Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among the great many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nAnd I'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the A. C. A. and tax reform so badly we still have to go with him and hopefully get somebody else at twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West Virginia thanks so much think yeah\nThe protests on Capitol Hill coming years since the advent of the me too movement started with Harvey one's done many actresses models employees and others who said that he sexually harassed or assaulted the allegations were supported by the New York times and the New Yorker\nWomen in Hollywood were quick to take up the cause she was Oprah Winfrey at this year's Golden Globes\nMe again [noise]\nEmbarrassed Elizabeth Blair takes a look at the impact of me to a year later\nAt Dunbar high school in Washington DC psychology teachers terrorists swallow once your students to consider some of the questions raised by the me too movement like consent should we be looking for the verbal ... Seventeen year old Marcus bright shares what he's learned of when you learn in may\nYou may or may they may be easily and\nAll right Sarah ... says me too it's been an opportunity to talk about serious and relevant issues like consent and sexual harassment\nBut it's important to teach our students when they're younger so that they don't grow up in a culture where they think it's okay it's China like give these girls and boys the voice to say like this was not okay I'm not going to tolerate a\nWomen aren't tolerating it either and the results are measurable this year sexual harassment

... says the interest generated by me to has been enormous\nWe've had a five fold increase of hits to our website of people looking for information about sexual harassment we've done hundreds of training sessions for employers\nHere's something else that has changed as a result of me too there's a real money available for women to get help so Sharon to Johnny\nI've been a civil rights lawyer

Shonda Rhimes and Meryl Streep the fund reached Twenty one million dollars in just two months at the same time to Johnny says there's only so much lawyers can do of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect and to learn and Miller's helped them when they can but sometimes there isn't something that can be done\nYou got a plow on the ground and plant the seeds before

surges like speeches and marches but they also need the behind the scenes work like the time's up legal Defense Fund\nThat underneath the rate or behind the scenes organizing is extremely important\nWhat you see are the search for what's catching our attention now is the vest turned out of people in the Kevin up\nAnd here today not because I see and terrified\nChristine Blasey Ford's

might not have come\nThey tend to take his place at the moment she wouldn't have had the courage to come forward and\nTo also terrified people allegations alone can get men fired many critics say the

Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching the\nYankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh thing and if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic ...\nA Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club [laughter] why you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... about a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nYeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs why pick to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you won't let me forget that but now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy ear and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden\nYou're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the road yeah mirror to another and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the

um\nIf Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process than some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm\nNow it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly

[laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bussing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do\nThe right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than looks possible that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it\nTo the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this did did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople they're basically two days of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they had was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nFoot ... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere a book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it it's often committed without witnesses and they feel\nNot to be believe you know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to content you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible [noise] um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this ... neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] ... [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations jumbo Bryan who's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course you suggested bitter Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependent\nSo that's another important theme of the story which is the president has said on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you that you can recognize and that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize is distinctly illegal\n[noise] [noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they use and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called\nAn odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nJim O'Brian of Bloomberg opinion thanks so much thank you Scott\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operative spotted microchips especially Mike Rowe microchips into service created by an American company called super micro\nI'm joyous later with these headlines President Trump has another campaign

it's been indicated\nAlso I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people at the party Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did get to him yesterday on\nThursday well tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we get so we had a group of women who sat in his office I day and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for ten hours listening to him they had a conference call it that my Monday that didn't really go out\nOn Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on my two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual\nThat are way he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the room but did it affect ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes your wife continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers are doing\nOur fight that continues so I as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other option Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kind of nearly a dozen believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical and West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nThat but I ... can't though this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... now of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republican as well well it does continue yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot set ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if you're Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still support among the grid many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized in democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the

Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh thing\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nMm I'm Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and\nYeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you forget that\nBut now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball and let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out well the Dodgers have a nationally champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with it I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing\nAnd they've got the rocks already on the road merit\nTo another and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his blindsided and yeah and it just seems to be reacting to to head concussion more\nNo they're not reacting or they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some 'cause in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension and the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at at the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nOr Brian thanks so much thank you he's part ... machine oh cop but\nGrief Nineteen Ninety seven's robocop there's a cult movie classic setting a dystopian Detroit\nBefore dystopian became

back in time through western art when you get to the renaissance it's politics and it's economics and its poetry and it's a change of\nThe look at the way the world looked at Roman classics a matter of fact the renaissance starts with the reinvention of classical literature Cicero Marshall living who talked what have you so I have to take classes in that so now I'm reading hooked\nAs I understand it your talk is titled the ... of tomorrow can you give us a preview\nWell I don't know who title it that I was just talking about the crisis of beauty mhm because Detroit is really in a city that's was hitting the skids and is really turning around its downtown area dramatically\nAnd the crisis of beauty or addressed by the culture left Detroit is what who and how we define is beautiful and\nIf it's put in the power of the wrong hands beautiful things I eat art will be destroyed or curse or ... blackened by somebody's opinion I mean someone can make some of those categories pronouncement or judgment on what he or she thinks is beautiful that's a crisis to me\n[noise] what will it be like for you to be back in Detroit\n[noise] it'll be fun man for someone to Detroit and I have to say you know I went to New York in Ninety Seventy one and it was dangerous and it was bad it was lethal and I raised that and it was gorgeous and it was exciting\nOr for someone with the Detroit I saw it and I think Nineteen eighty two or three something like that and it was the same way uh you couldn't go out in a hotel at night and I thought oh my God get me outta here man and then it went back and I
