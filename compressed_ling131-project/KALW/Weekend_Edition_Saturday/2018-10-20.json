men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is folks\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this

S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his\nWind up front about this or transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed and have it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWould I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom is pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to

lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but

him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nCancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts are facts are as is the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that your mouth ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nUh and and he talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November\nBe a bright flashing invitation every traffickers\nEli in on the planet come on and come on and uh so that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of death but your mouth ...\nAnd here is Don Gonyea thanks very much for being with us then you've got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth showed gee\nWe turn now to evil do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as\nThe ... the throne America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died recruiting you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a pump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nUh how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the exports of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed and in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nThe rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and\nUh it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and\nMake clear that the kind of behavior we named\nTop two weeks it's unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nInstead of

few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week\nIt included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day from it\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production cotton at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal in lynching near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato needles wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs that it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with says spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\n[noise] we've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did she tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it\nTake opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of\nUm disappeared again drove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many\nWhat made you sure all of this and you're aerobics or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know [noise]\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate song she was just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity\nFor our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday what bunny rich on man [noise] I Can't make you love me\n\n\nCater O'Neill

correspondent NPR's Ron Elving can tell us Ron thanks so much for being with us good to be with you\nShouldn't to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of Jamal ... or the president calls it credible lots in Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of this story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is folks\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the care of and it's been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me\nYes the stopping the caravan and the threat of withheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nAll be noted uh it does seem those of the polls have tightened in recent days I haven't they\nYes some of the polls have tightened and for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in the month before an election especially if we've seen one party or the other getting well ahead in the early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of Republicans in recent

friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U.

embarrassed and have it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump

of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades bras and says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials

till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in\nThat we do here I Want to know yes [laughter] I Know\nAnd in in that sport it's a big deal in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important in these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more

I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe [laughter] uh I Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal\nPodium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nAnd the baby of an HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant and risk transferring HIV or\nAbout the child grow sicker and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far\nThere has been no sign of HIV sure\nOrgan donors in South Africa are about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world [noise]\nDoctor Harriet death riches and medical bioethicist to ditch Donald Gordon medical center that's where the crunch flat happened and she was part of a team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing and the\nBaby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see the child's alive and thriving under these circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't [noise] yeah\nSo we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child had been on a waiting list for a living in Darnah\nFor three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU have needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so that was said to me that wish from the parents and the ... particularly who was the dar now that she could be a diner\nAnd we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this very brave says parents who wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] talk records do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hope so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays the U.S and South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show to what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nTalked harried Etheridge medical bioethicist to bitch Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you very much\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJoan of arc has become such an emblematic figure ashamed of the Catholic Church the inspiration of so many novels she films that of course George Bernard draws iconic play we might sometimes forget she was a real teenage girl was burned to shake and fourteen thirty one she did for", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20"}
