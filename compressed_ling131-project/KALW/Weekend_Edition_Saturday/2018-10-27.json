some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly that's consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to um decipher it because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes\nTo a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters and you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boating college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and Tamara weekend edition

bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pitchers used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a healer dealer [laughter] if I thought he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker bealer being the start of the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into games for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun\nTom Goldman thanks so much You're

federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed\nInternet research agency to use Twitter box to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew ... sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the playing of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then\nAnd so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data is which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been close but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty

able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings\nAnd I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story then sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human

suspicious packages sent prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump seizure say I was arrested friday morning in Florida and faces federal charges\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas joins Ryan thanks so much for being with us from I ... a what a week a chaotic and concerning\nNow how the FBI cracked the case\nIt was really a clue pulled off of ah one of the packages that did it remember when when these packages started showing up the authorities took a took charge of them sent them to the FBI lab in Quantico in Virginia\nAnd folks there than rent tests on them analyze them and they were able to pull a fingerprint off of one of the these bubble light manila envelopes that fingerprint matched say ox\nAuthorities say there's also possible DNA connection from two of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent it\nMatch because he was in that it was in the system\nRight exactly be the because of previous legal trouble a DNA connection or appears to ... as well and then there's a third bit of evidence here which is from the digital world and that is a the FBI identified a Twitter account that it says belongs to say or some of the words that were misspelled on the packages and a match the wrong spellings on his Twitter account\nAnd what more we learned about this uh this man in the white van in a parking\nLot is fifty six years old resident of South Florida registered as a Republican in March of ... of twenty sixteen there is a pretty a long trail and public records of his legal troubles he's face felony theft fraud drug charges was arrested over a bomb threat back in two thousand two as well\nHe's clearly had financial difficulties over the years he filed for bankruptcy for example in two thousand twelve and then that filing he said that he lived with his mother that he didn't own any furniture or we know that he spent a lot of time at the gym and he also worked at a at a strip club\nOr a lot of public attention of course has been put on this white van that you mentioned a that authorities say belonged to say oc this of course is the one uh that was plastered with pro Trump stickers anti Democrat anti CNN stickers we've all seen a lot of photos of that for the next steps\nWell he's been charged in federal court in New York with five counts those include illegally mailing explosives threatening former presidents\nHe's currently being held at the federal detention center in Miami is expected to be in court on Monday\nOr not to key questions after his arrest for authorities are one whether he was acting alone or had accomplices\nIn to whether there were any other package is still out there and that's something that yesterday FBI Director Christopher Wray cautioned the public about he said there may still be more out there are as things stand the FBI has confirmed at least fourteen homemade explosive devices\nEach one had a six inch piece of PVC pipe small clock batteries wiring and potential explosive material folks at the FBI lab are still examining needs to see whether they are indeed functional bombs but rate was explicit about this he said be sure these were not hoax devices\nAnd of course the the the packages were sent to prominent Democrats and uh and critics of President Trump um is there a political angle that seems to have motivated these actions [noise] ... attorney general Jeff Sessions was\nAsked that exact question uh yesterday and all that he would say is that say appears to be politically partisan part is in fact that's what he said\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial

and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about the tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the\nTone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more main\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle vote set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and tomorrow and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us in how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\n[noise]\nAnd it's time for sports\n\nThe harder it is by the time I really began to get up for\nThere the longest Damon World Series history and we're still going on [noise] Eighteen innings seven hours ... minutes is longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to walk home or by max Muncie\nIn the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best pitcher on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it didn't even throw the ball or does it is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named the starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and uh the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe ... season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker ... started\nThe night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask a either of these teams Scott because they both put up sully everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome\nThe dual Bob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nThe Tracy and Hepburn the rocky and Apollo of the basketball court they could anticipate each other's play they could put themselves into each other's minded movements as they won six championships for the Boston Celtics and the Nineteen fifties and sixties and but just a dynasty that would win eight in a row [noise]\nBob Cousy was the point guard listed is six foot one doesn't sound basketball toll today\nA white man who grew up the son of poor French immigrants in Manhattan bill Russell was the senator six foot ten black men born in segregated Louisiana they became teammates in Nineteen fifty seven just after Martin
