and the first has to be UC intelligence reports are you convinced the Saudi Government or its operatives assassinated ... showed\nA not yet completely convinced but there's enough corroboration out there that I think the burden of proof is on the Saudis to prove that they did not have anything to do either with harming kidnapping are killing ... show the burden of proof is on them\nIf that

off relations\nWill ... will Scott first I mean this is a horrific a alleged crime against a journalist or our president attacks journalists as enemies of the people but we need to stand up\nFor journalists everywhere Jamal ... Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee on which I said is we sent a letter to the president to trigger\nIs a review of whether this\nTreatment of mock show you violate something called the Magnitsky Act Magnitsky Act\nAllows the White House to put sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send a letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether there have been a human rights violation and what they're going to do about it that's number one\nNumber two um we have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia and working to potentially these arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy have talked about this is\nAdditional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day but you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the\nFor the Saudis and the ... the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just\nA cease us support for the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a long standing relationship with Saudi Arabia but I think there are there are Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen are\nProbably the three areas where Congress has now most focused and and it is a dramatic change in attitude about Saudi Arabia as a result of this action\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services

three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up to\nBe and then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy ... he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um\nShe said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the bases really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to have to show up\nJohnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you\n[noise]\nDavid Sheff realized his teenage son Nick was living on the street addicted to crystal meth he

this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a face has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lotta people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ...\nNot far from places you know\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know ... molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's hard to think of all\nAnd it hurts your face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do no I Do not\nFortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\n[noise] do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who would have been harmed [noise]\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops in people whose names are plastered up on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you afraid for version\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months I'm moving to a new area from starting a new\nA new part of my life and send the breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a face and I just see much luck with the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\nNo ... no of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in such a personal way no thank you for having me\n... got a rare glimpse inside a

a credible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she ... she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a writer Lee practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps in a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we face up\nTo the outside world your mother a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television is on a political prognostications\nMake much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those meetings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was joined us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that is I was gonna say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em [noise] and he knew virtually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleeping and brought from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much in Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the lotto myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were in that\nWe can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling most as my family and stuff and we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my

Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee

House to put sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send the letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether they're going to human rights violation and what they're going to do about it that's number one\nNumber two um we have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia\nAnd working to potentially these arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy have talked about this\nIs additional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the for the Saudis and the UAE and the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just a cease us support\nFor the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia\nBut I think there are there Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen are probably the three areas where Congress has now most focused and and it is a dramatic change in attitude about Saudi Arabia as a result of this action\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial

showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined us Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up their problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nThe group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they said that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office\nEnding the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up\nJohnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you\n[noise]\nBut David Sheff

restaurants in Wisconsin have had this promotion for years that if the brewers when\nTwelve in a row the restaurant gives away free burgers or last time this happened was in Nineteen eighty seven so this coming week it'll be burger mania you would think in twenty eight teen there'd be something for healthier eaters but I haven't heard anything about any vegan promotion\nOh and also I mean I I I've noticed constant being from what they call the flat land in Illinois and I mean you know certainly a rock worst would be what I Would think they'd give away but you know what do I that's\nJust the cubs that's the cubs win twelve and a real will stick with the brewers a and the brew the broker was really good aren't they\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know last night on a night when their biggest star outfielder Christian yell at she was hit list and he struck out three times the the other brewer's did their jobs and in the case of relief pitcher Brandon would resume you alluded to\nHe did even more he pitched a great couple of early innings and he hit this towering home run off LA started Clayton ... the great Clayton curse shot who's Scott does seem to become the troubled\nClinton curse on the postseason a winter is home run and you know pictures are supposed to hit home runs certainly in the postseason\nA it energized the brewers they took us six one lead into the eighth inning the Dodgers didn't make it close and actually had a chance to win in the ... at the very end but the Milwaukee hold on one sixty five or should be more thrills today in game two\nUh this rose and the boat shocks Boston as the most wins of any team the season and make quick work of the gangs but the Astros could be even stronger than they were last year couldn't ...\nYou know but by virtue of of how they are playing right now I liked the defending champion Astros Scott they pounded Cleveland in the American league division series three games to none by combine score of Twenty one to six\nUh and the red Sox beat the Yankees as you mentioned but to the winds were kind of nervous one run when so I'm like in Houston in this series\nUh American women soccer team a place Trinidad and
