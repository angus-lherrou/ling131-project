{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "It's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun for us to have the boxes [noise] government\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nAnd the people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run school one of them is the only woman on the team visually pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this work exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school I saw the ride a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drill okay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills so the first\nLittle glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe you had to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky\n\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve\nHe's running from his office starts\nHe's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking you told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings and other to\nKill not enough of this way [noise]\nI'll marry wing assumed the elementary wing [noise]\n\nElementary waiting to building also has middle school and high school\nRight so the principal is running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's locked this happens automatically wonderful doesn't to lock down the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one man\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors\nBut guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seem like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now she doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter gotten it the other thing they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nAnd so I went out and start learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss\nThere's a possibility or somebody else getting her\nAll right and I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it\nBe me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of the students and a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll pass to dissipate the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help the\nBBC Chicago this American Life America ... stay with us [noise]\n\n\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty sure that's trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school\nThe teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training I don't think I did this\nCats are these people are going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threat hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby and active shooter\nDouglas it's a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard thank and being proactive once she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nFor every period for every this is what a code black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy during an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see and\nThat's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in the restaurant kitchens not living are cool but she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught or you can choose to follow the protocol follow your ending for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency\nFolder she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class\nShe pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone said told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was grades in her arm viable it\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway I'm without really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nWhen I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was I kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police have anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nFirst thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken political that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know without being able to close the door\nAnd grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed 'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see the teacher who's our most grades she survived [noise] got Beagle and the room next to Stacy used at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a play\nAbout for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has said lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at the glass like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nCan films I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet\nBut the idea that this is all you do\nThat you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultant I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate\nThat's that's like a cafeteria gym [noise]\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to actually curse how sheets dinner doorway grabbing a dozens of scared student I'm ever arose a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded on your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door [noise] but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricade at her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to tell the kids into her room from the hallway\nShut down on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would have made it and\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nStudents did a traditional lockdown sweating high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\n... and the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricaded him\nAnd I want her to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with [noise]\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n... ... ... ...\nThis year at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one ... and they already did a code red trail\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and this was before I was going on in this world is not going to change just because they're strictly Jersey stroke doors are so able to hit and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing\nOutreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving\nParents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control about he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and other than I'm listening to him just going you\nAre so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere's truth or ... or ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous\nAfter the Philips his son gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hope there's or one of the things that Philips has warned parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMhm mhm [noise] mhm\nAfter watching Lonnie and fanny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were\nTwelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was\n[noise] screaming Josh\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left us food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWith that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other oh they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents\nWhen they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings you parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents have lots of kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends\nTo normal my own brother should they should dream of shame as you were should know let me explain something to your right I'm not the same person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with this will you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\n[noise] was that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son and the shooting at Parkland on a good in that store at and let them at their house there is something with Nick he was the captain the Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of\nOreos and waited for Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting Mitch an article about phone\nCalls and tax all day from people who've said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that you thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from the insurance\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\nWe we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that he was somewhere else and I take it if I'm thinking maybe he walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn a good says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas where it takes a swimmer swimmer is perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like he was able to perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his tough destroyed his heart and lungs are just see him\nYes it was awful because your\nPicture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an air Fifteen just so gross I'm so horrible horrible\nAnd I think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were were um made me get it like he was so peaceful", "show_name": "This American Life",
