W. dot org the time now is one o'clock it's time for this American Life member of the news was\nBoring and politics was boring that happen right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different\nConclusions and to me this one feels the worst [noise] I think to the original hearing itself the doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so why don't like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion what was the setting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same data vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a\nMan's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBoth those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all the [noise] the b._b._c. Chicago which is American Life America stay with us [laughter]\nWas judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the\nDrama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nDrag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided didn't seem like a no when Kavanaugh was yes and was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than it was a yes again a British as though he chases spent a\nLot of time with Jeff Flake of last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing\nWatching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story and Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at slate peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview [noise] just like these can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote and now he was\n\nWe asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flicking declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that he was confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nOr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were the last of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe\nProtest works so much of these last two weeks and then people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all the time she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have\nAlso we talked about it wasn't the ... and there was a it was the thing\nIs not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect\nHim like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the\nOther side of the building he was in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat are you know one way and therefore when you when you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say that went in right now in the survivors\nDid it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe sleek making fun of themselves we talked about before\nLike lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion\n[noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say\nGoing into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would\nBelieve in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just to ensure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and then then there's likely to be as much doubt a certain to\nGo out of this room today\nThanks you if you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to clean because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nTonight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said\nHe sounds Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony Noone else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nOr any decision on a vote\n'em that's been just\n... to ... debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\n[noise] next morning of course we finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the end you've got to come back to\nPerson should have been a ...\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise]\nMeanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly says and then we each make choices for our own region struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital\nThose two days the meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably checks Twitter because he usually does but\nHe says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR ... says he wasn't thinking about that at all so he comes back and then Coons gives a speech at\nThe committee meeting that he said was directed at one man Jeff Flake they're actually friends during the Foreign Relations committee together they'd been all over Africa together too\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied that the FBI report [noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that's what we're only about a party [laughter]\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro with not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever\n\nChase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today it's just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process of changed since you went through it well I like my own uh\n[noise]\nYou know remember the\nIs a political body and\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n... ...\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSo so so so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people ask them by the state cases we'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explain this job how it works\nNine of us and um\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nIf the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that\nIt's a five four case and it's not just reverse refer him it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realized one of us will have\nTo write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nUh an opinion that explains\nTeach the principles of law or the principles of the constitution\nThe the control as a result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case uh we draw down on that capital of trust we make a withdrawal and the trust that in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nThat trust\nBy hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n[noise] well\n[noise] you know people in my story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play\nGolf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand he said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs\nAh how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nI Divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one application sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded kind of what intellectually\nPretentious thirty on here's some\nEastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I

make\nDecisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the tide cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with that want to make right with another person usually it's something they'd been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty you\nKnow lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get a jury duty but I was more

may hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that\nForgiveness it felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that\nAnd like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her method ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nI did begin to apply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] feel like a really recognize a [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that\nThe state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and due to carry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of is deeds\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it\nIt's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nCannot do English has done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing [noise] shame leads to a nurse or even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you\nEntered object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this was a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too\nForward ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shows or forwards originally emailed us then once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nExpecting a grand gesture of forgiveness but Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks fend for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much and just so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n...
