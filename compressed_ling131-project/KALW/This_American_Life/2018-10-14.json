o'clock\nIn the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters do use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nEvery bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district of rural Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team we to teachers I'll do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team recently with the public watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations all over the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the near safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills\n[noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the safe you have to put your finger on the sensor is\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shoe [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nHe's a principal for grade six to twelve\nHe's running from his office starts\nHe's got a gun he's rambling proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings and other to kill not enough of this way [noise]\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\n\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school doesn't to lock down the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go\n[noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response\nWasn't great that wasn't going to turn in their first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nBut I I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nIn an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a sheet or gotten a building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and\nAnd so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out\nAnd start learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target pills close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause if I miss\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student at my school\nOf course she might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday in prison we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll pass it would just be the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nWB easy Chicago it's this American Life America last [noise] stay with us\n\nOr\nEdwin ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen\nThere's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think anything more prepared than where I say I mean they knew what I mean you\nCan tell even\nThe training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers\nPrepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard thank and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery Syrian ... this is what a code black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and I was silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors the paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for\nAn active shooter to see and that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not living are cool\nBut she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem live and be like that you\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol follow your ending for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nIn her classroom with about our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class\nShe pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied cause that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark didn't bases led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there's a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was grades in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a please send you went in here\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police\nThey have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they had their weapons drawn she really just had to guess\nAre saying they were cops and so I just very slowly ... than\nYou pulled on the handle push it open and said\nWe're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands in polls that closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] got Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this\nAbout ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University\nAnd it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas\nPartly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done it Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't get how much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings\nCan films I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to okay code red meat families active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise]\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs\nHow she eats dinner doorway grabbing a dozens of students from ever rose up right from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually ...\nAnd unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably and in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\n[noise] but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would have made it and\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school sweating I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researchers who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids who don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricaded\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't say codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n... ... ... ... ...\nThis year at Douglas there are new gate new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff\nGodzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one and they already did a code red trail only this time there was no confusion about one it would be school called parents\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and start selling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the evidence is going on on the road [noise] it can go with this ... strictly Jersey drug stores are still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year the filters are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around\nGuns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going ...\nYou are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists noticed truth ...\nTroll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was writing him ended up in jail hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm mhm [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started\nJesse find called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming\nHorrible screaming in the background\nPanic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about his Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nSandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWith that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the ... there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lots of kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the fields as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child body home if you live out of state\nHowever this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should they should [laughter] you're not the same as you were should no limit explain something to your right I'm not the same person I've ever will be they should as we're obsessed with this will you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand\nAll the way people you are closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\n[noise] was that support looked like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son and the shooting in Parkland Hanukkah and that store at\nI met them at their house there is something was neck he was the cats in the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mission aka got phone calls\nAnd tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that you thought patient who mash next corruption [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area they sat in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um media was calling you you have any comments can we have to find your son as just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from these rooms\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I thought that he was somewhere else and I take it if I'm thinking maybe he walks home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long\nTo our house and then they told us the news that he was ... he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust second nightmare second ...\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again\nIs Nicholas ... is a swimmer swimmer is perfect [noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face her head like he was he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes he left for because your\nPicture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an air
