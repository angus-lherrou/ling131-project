home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like are we loved her summer before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n[noise]\nMe too I'm sixteen a cashier at thrift way foods different marketing genetic\nWhere I Lived the place was packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and there's Susan Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has been some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seemed happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nI tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up\nShe said great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep planting behind Susan making apologetic gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally ... the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at thrift rape or two more years and our businesses in Jordan again\nOr\nOr\nThat drives me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that moment\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan right\nIsn't sure\nSure yes it's bringing up out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like in my past\nOf the many ideas that Susan introduced to her household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Sudan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter really add more of a relationship with you too and she did when I\nAnd um it was really\nIt was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed it I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I would I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how's desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean the people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\nI mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lotta times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead\nSo yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family\nOh\nEvery time the subject for hard times came up I hear settle hesitancy towards\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly\nIt wasn't until we been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids loved me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be dead but if I heard anything different Mm\n\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to the proceeds in Jordan you're for life that I remember\nIs he or she just did you forget\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like that yeah\nI didn't think of myself as where it all with us from Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nNot just the missing and all that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got to strike but it just seems like they were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite at play full as other kids that I had they not just in more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face departure\nShe said she mostly remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keeps people lived differently than the way I left and that's what I decided I wanted from I Know\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings or you can find someone who knew back then someone you haven't seen since [noise] they still carry within themselves the picture of you to send clouded by the years between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you can do the same thing for them\nTo be out\nSoon but he did that story back when he was a producer here at our show no even pod casting company called ... media and he hosted the pod cast without fail\nHundred and a gray flannel suit\nFor a long time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in\nBeverly Hills as you might imagine the Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages dresses beautiful clothes clean cut\nBack in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up using a punk band called the automatic\nYou never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing that a few years back there not series of connections ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back\nOn tour in a version of his band in Japan here is that something that happened I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in in in ... when I when I was a kitten and you're not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of them over ... and so I did this year\nAnd I saw the ... so it was and I watched as what can I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize wait a minute [laughter]\nI'm collectible [laughter] get down to press Hector how much we got that one\nI particularly like looking as you know all that sort of a\nOf the groups that we're getting a twenty five cents I'm\nYou know music business\nOr offerings along punk lines or that you know I don't want to live out not to set the time and it was good to see that uh\nYou know ... values years later I mean it was it was ...\nThat history came out on the right side [noise]\nYes that ah there is a sort of Darwinism uh in in uh in record collecting [noise]\nWhatever\nThat I went to conceive Vicki the drama and Ricky collected everything you know ... and he very kindly lent me uh these two scrapbooks so I took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up on a had a friend put it up on a website\nAnd um\nThen I got an email from ... in um in Japan's saying you know I play in Japanese punk rock rock band and a ... a ... percent yes uh-huh and uh your record changed my life well\n... and he found out through the website that you know there was an on release down so I'll be honest you know if you could put me in touch with a ... of a base Michael Woods\nWhich we struck up a deal and then they said well would you come over here and play some gigs to uh you know for my age [noise]\n\nSo you go to ... how old are you at that point a forty five forty five years old or a little bit of gray hair coming into the middle ground here come in and uh\nAnd and what really wasn't sure whether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it because I haven't played those films in twenty two years\nYou know not in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women for you know uh yeah we never knew that I played as it has had ever played\n... you know it wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I may not have a good time around but you know lots of other guys did to would you ever pick of the guitar and play for yourself yes I'd read lots of songs my dog during this period [laughter] some of the titles would they were going to the park was a big favorite [laughter]\nTo be followed by that here is a good boy [laughter] what a good boy is actually a it is [noise] what a lot of good boy [laughter]\n\nSo ah we whenever they want the type of sick to my wife which\nPossibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] no it's a good thing to take my wife gets or are you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls\nI was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first time you went on stage well there was just you know the announcement\nThe light [noise] and so the moment finally [noise] which last year [noise]\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the deep thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\n\n\n... or or regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\n... made me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes out of it was on Capitol [laughter]\nWow [laughter] [noise]\nMoved [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] now that said that it's kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see\nMean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel [laughter] right [laughter]\nOh that I Need to know the national anthem will probably that's the fun through a site that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something they never sent you right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it\nInstead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know\nI mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um\nI didn't have much angry about being the future prime\nMinister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know\nThere was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great and\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience in a million people\nWas was getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just have your\nPetty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old [laughter] just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio ...\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the New York\nNew York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on to the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIn history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is it pretty street place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity kangaroos\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect\nPeople to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\n[noise] there was the beginning of the school year and we were um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad\nAnd [noise] I guess basically got him on a on someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how magnificent he was and I'm actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\nTo see a\nLot about it um [noise] it actually good you know start me thinking along [laughter] a peculiar path\n...\nTalked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over ... that said in ...\nI Am nine feet tall\nAnd see giant in eight pm slot\nScott had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the cloud to dispense aside time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nHe gave giant man a booming voice\nPart or even know exactly with something like you know old I Am drawing you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nSuggesting that [laughter] way you know I don't know\nSon asked his college friends holding access giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrapped around the middle of hide food\nAnd ... really way like the guy I think\nWe pick up a point in the bushes put on that I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the quad and for the game and I got on the shoulders basically have to like around my waist we walked out\nAnd I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people Fifteen people try and I remember them being way on the other five and sort of running and it was so ridiculous about it was the other is like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all sort of coming to work very right like you know what what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city":
