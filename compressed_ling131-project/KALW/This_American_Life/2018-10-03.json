serial which just launched its third season and I could say all kinds of great things about their thirties and then why should done with it but I Will not right now instead\nOf just trying to show that would sure this is Hannah\nOh hi this is Sarah from this American Life Hi how are you I'm good thank you how are you good\nBefore we go any further from WB easy Chicago it's this American Life I'm ... sitting in for Ira Glass and you're about to hear this story the same way I did\nBlind all I Know is that it's going to have a coincidence in it\nI have no idea what you're about to tell me so oh yeah and I land on me\nSo story is I was a freshman in high school um at both in high school in Montana\nYes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have extra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip\nSo that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman this qualifies as a demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle sharing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common so they decide to pair up room together and ride the bus together to be orchestra friends\nSo um we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know because we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free\nDays they send us to the Space Needle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I have there is that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing\nThe little games all around there and we won the super troopers\nDo you know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand and\nOh what did you go [laughter] ... trooper really\nI didn't quite believe him about this but she looked it up it's true poop a troopers\nI just did a Google image search okay but troopers and I'm seeing images of the little guy is the way it is it a generic name or is it the brand name I think it's a brand name I think from what I'm seeing here imperial super troopers\n[laughter] Hyannis port or general group a trooper\nYes [laughter] exactly [laughter]\nBack to the blonde hair Hannah and her new friend Lindsey go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try out their prizes\nSo we we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and rented it and it's rooted approval troopers over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really yeah and we were just like in peel of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice in our friendship\nLindsay and had become best friends all through high school cut to senior year\nReno nevada hennan Lindsey or in their hotel rooms studying\nAnd so when ... sitting at the desk in this hotel room in Reno nevada end up poop a trooper comes flying\nOut of the sky and land on the windows so\n[laughter] we're and we\nLike we couldn't we couldn't believe it when you open the window and we read the true Britain we ran into the whole to try to like find other people that are just are like we thought would have been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that happened [laughter] [noise]\n\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories just they don't really fit into our usual every week we bring you a theme format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them I mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it when it felt you know I I'm not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like just sort of cosmic larger about us [noise]\nFinally and hit us if we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own thing so we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did hundreds and hundreds of you did\nWe rent at least Thirteen hundred coincidence stories interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned your most prone to go incidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidence is also happened to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list\nFor many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike also there are coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard stories\nAbout a lost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach of a decomposing hyena about the man who got his favorite T shirt back from a stranger's naps act in Slovakia\nAbout the woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson's at the same time about the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway\nAnd the one person who just happens to stop comes to a rescue it's her dad who lives for hours away and one of my favorites from a woman named Joe Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City\nAs they pull into the second avenue stop there is a garbage can perfectly positioned to help her out\nSo the train doors open and be lining up for this can and as I get there I ... my I cannot see like another person heading mind or action kind of like going for ...\nAnd uh [noise] you know it's it's all coming out and [laughter] I'm throwing up and as an growing up in the can I just heard that it was coming towards me start throwing up and they can to and we're both like animals teenage like barking and so they can\nHave the right age and and every kind of look at each other like wow\nI don't know what how how are you feeling like I'm feeling a little bit better now might need to\nWhat's the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice grill your age do it with you\nAnd numbers so many coincidences with numbers one woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with our extended family and I suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names twenty three letters\nMichael are serve antibody Mary Elizabeth ... William Arthur\nEvent the body cameras to guide them\nThe guy who surveying starts to make up a number he says nine three three four five six\nWhen he read out that last number said eight and I try to step back for a second but I was cool and I said no sir I'm Sorry that's not your phone number and he said well why is it that my phone number and that's it because that's my phone number\nThat's my point of the phone number that you just made up is actually my phone number [noise]\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I work at a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old it is but it goes like\nThis food shelter ... that's my friend un U. N. D. food shelter ...\nAnd what if any if there's no coincidence ... stories\nNo coincidence no story to imply that of course life's Earl\n... developed in ways that we can predict so is it like if you heard a story with a coincidence afterwards he might be like no coincidence no story like that right yes just the expression you use it to quote I say like a corny thing to say mostly I think no it won't be I mean this do you ever use it\nWhen corneas [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say at today's show no coincidence no story while the big bands away we're going to sneak these coincidence stories onto their\nAll the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty Thirteen and they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid for me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoil the surprise which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling this hour\nAnd full disclosure I came into this topic a coincidence skeptic believing that a coincidence\nIs just a coincidence nothing more\nI judged I confronted weakness I countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end well stay with us [noise]\nAct one grandma's [noise]\nLike Oliver is living in Nicaragua right now we talked on Skype about four months ago he was on the phone to his friend\nCamille who goes by Kenny he mentioned her that the screen saver on his iPhone had been the same picture for a long time that he wanted to change it\nBut I asked her to I'm just sent me a picture of something uh-huh and and it was really funny she ended up sending me this picture of her as little kid as a joke mhm it was like oh yeah kind of funny ... affecting the fine and then I glance back\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nSo how mothers has nothing goes home the later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been she explained that the reason they hadn't married was because her father highlands grandfather\nHad chosen a different has been for the man who became hound father all of them ended up living in the U. S. they quickly lost touch Steven didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later\nThat's what the hell and you know cause that says a ash that tell you and she tells me and I was I was floored by it um and you know together will be called my mom and you know she put a good face on it she but she was you know she was pretty shocked\nDid she know that there had been this other woman that your father had in love that is the\nThing my dad told her years and years ago you know there was this other woman that I that I that I Would love without ... you know long before I met you but mom was like look you look past ... past who cares um\nOf course you know never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that woman I mean she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have not supported Helena me um you you know it would just been like look\nBeing with the daughter of this ... of the other woman your dad loved I mean it would ... you find someone else [laughter]\n\nHow do you take this coincidence ... did it come to mean anything to you or to ...\n[noise] yeah there's something about it the fact that\nYou know I didn't have the time with my dad that I Wish I had yeah and then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life again to think that uh I could talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd you know it might actually held his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this that somehow you know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named Esther they'd been out maybe eight times\nI thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking\nShut up and I went out to lunch with stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit and uh I got some change went to the deli order my sandwich was six box or something like that I pulled out of five from my wallet and I pulled out a couple of bucks change that I had gotten from a store\nHanded the clerk one of the ones are and then I looked at it and I I pulled back\nWritten on the dollar and pencil was I asked her and I thought oh that's weird you know I'm thinking about asking her go studying I get this dollars is a strange bizarre just stuck in my pocket you know charcoal and went to the store I got one of those floating frames and a little piece of gold what may and I stopped a dollar and the frame\nSo it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold as if you know you're going to do in a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some saying or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n\nAnd so I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all getting that I I had one more\nThing for you and I gave her this frame with US dollar in it\nI start ... and he's like it's a dollar with your ... and he's he's on like beside himself and I I look at 'em like freaked out\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit and look concerned and ah I said you know is there a some sort of problem\nI I was speechless for the first time ever\nBut I said you know remind me to tell you something later\n... ... ...\n... okay you know we I I let it go and uh we you know where we had a really should have got engaged got married a couple of years later\nWe were um unpacking at a new apartment that we had an and I had the they found that the frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm you never told me about this dollar what's the deal with that she said well\nWhen everything team you know I was a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know\nWho the right person that they're meant to be with how do how do they know who that is I said you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets US dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just write them your name I Want\nActually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve [noise]\nAnd so this dollar bill thank you gave the I Believe is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married the day that you gave me the style or but\nIt was pretty crazy and then you make me telling this story again he asked me like five or six times and I said the details on change is the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside himself that that actually happened and that I didn't tell [noise]\n\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the will to not say anything to 'em but I just remember like do I don't I Do I donate to it you know what do I do\nI don't want this guy out and be like what this is not really talking about Mary wait well forget it\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything [laughter] so I just got to move\nForward and then after she told me I think I went through all the the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean for us are we\nGoing to invent a time machine or our kids gonna bring world peace or like well what's the point of some sort of bigger thing that we are to us\nNo just sits in that very same frame up on our dresser and I look at it every day that I Would go\nSometimes I reminder that we have it\nWhen she's upset at me or angry\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know what I'm going to get this kind of the curve when it happened I Do believe it's because of his dollar than I Do feel that tied to them I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind it would be like but we I this is my soul mate I Can't just walk out and [noise]\nYou know we don't we don't even wear wedding bands I'm like why because I Know I'm stuck with you you got the dollar bill [laughter]\nI guess you could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like ... [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you could do that [noise]\nPaul and Esther ... had been married for Nineteen years [noise]\nAgo [noise]\nSo do you [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThree brother can you spare a dime\nThis story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity ... and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something and so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly\nWhere he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears that team\nAnd he looks down and sitting on the floor of the shower between its feet is a nickel\nAnd has no idea where this nickel came from or you'll live there or you know obviously like we like everyone making jokes that you know he had changed\nFalling out of his but [laughter] you know people are like where you're eating dollar bills you know\n[laughter] but anyway we our laps and I I go home and I don't think much about it the next day I get in the shower and like five ten minutes into my shower I hear it\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] [noise]\nI look down and write between like he is a quarter\n[noise] so uh my first thought was you know how did they do it like my thought was I totally assumed that that must not have really happened to him that was set up and somehow they set this up to happen to me but I could not figure out how much just like you know they have to be a prank basically\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd done said\nYeah there's been a girl missing\nOn the west side of town for the last couple of days so my God\nSo down like our hearts just sort of drop\nAnd you hadn't known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea that idea\nSo we we just kind of got scared at that point\nCan I can I just have you ever second is this going to get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any I mean do you okay don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and\nThe other officer comes there's a couple cars\nAnd they both get out and tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom so we're waiting there you go walking up\nAnd it's dark so we can't really\nSee them that well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying to look but of course I'm working\nPulled up the human figure out of the whole\nOh my God and then she says\nIt's a mannequin [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know what my friend who's been but I was sitting there thinking own like\nHow does this story ended up okay and I was in in any universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say it's a man [laughter]\nJust goes to school on Monday tells his story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover\nMannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's nativity scene [noise]\nI think the real coincidence is that it's like our close friends that\nCaused this to happen or they were good friends years yeah\nNo Jeff turns out that is not the real convinced that ends up the story liberties or\nBrian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted as to tell us we both\nAre both were in the bathroom or story I submitted it to the current events is going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nFive words for you to have food shelter ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection\nIt's the middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on\nBecause when events lineup just so you can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to a very big questions about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one\nThe notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young [noise] the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line\nThat all black magic that Billy Daniels got me in and I've heard her you know saying that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered this bill he Daniels but on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the living room and ask my dad typically Daniels was and he explained that\nIn the forties the Billy Daniels had some old like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI'd ask my dad had she met him you know did you ever know Daniels and he said that began you know he's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang\nSo I answered the phone and this playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley\nAnd I said who's who's calling you should begin [noise]\nMeasures to do\nSo last September um I was living in Roswell New Mexico and I had woken up in jail for like the last time\nThis was at a ... percent when this happened she was Twenty years old on drugs\nHanging out with street kids her mom offered to buy or a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab at a said yes she took her dog and got on the bus in Los Angeles there was a stopover at the depot and this guy comes up to her well she's waiting in line to get food she got two dollars just enough for some French fries the\nGuy starts asking her questions about her dog\nAnd he started asking the other hand them questions like what do you do on where you're going and then he asked me are you from Alaska and I'm like oh yeah I Am actually and then he asked me is your mom name Nick and I was like\nUm mhm yeah she is and you're like oh well on credit some your father I like ten years ago\nAnd I'm like oh holy\n[laughter] and I had only seen her father that one time briefly and she was eleven\nAnd then he pulled out a lot of money and like he paid for my food and then they can't they forty bucks and it's like don't than ever gave enough and and walked away\nMm that what I [laughter]\nI'm ... I'm like shocked by this story and he didn't that was it you didn't see him again he didn't know [noise]\nYou could tell you I'll ...\nOh yeah I I really just not going down to like sit\nDown and eat together and I was gonna you know lay out my whole life story for him and he was gonna plane his life where white men\nI was kind of looking forward to that but that didn't happen mostly I just I Want to study it face for longer because that's\nI mean I've seen it twice and I I still can't really remember what he looks like do you regret\nNot not pursuing him in some way\nYeah absolutely and the moment I was just you know so sick I just really couldn't comprehend whether\nThought on the bus and I was kind of just like why didn't I run after him I've just spent my whole life wondering how this man and you know the chance to talk to him was put right in front of my age [noise] I didn't really understand that at the time and I like um\nMm\nAmelia ... Garcia Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father and many years since he was seven or eight years old he lived in California but he was visiting a national park in Mexico with his mother when he was Eighteen and they hide to the top of the pyramid there the whole place is sort of off the beaten track\nOr walking walking along the ... people back to front of us and my mom said oh my God ... and then she turned to me and said that that's your father [noise] um that's your dad and I was\nAlso coincidentally it was Father's Day\nI I ended up sort of thing like breaking down crying on that pyramid I was really emotional moment for me and my father definitely you know his accent meant a lot\nAnd we said yeah we're going to stay in contact and after they buy they left and she came running back up the hill about twenty minutes later you're panting said really on on just want to say I'm Sorry I didn't stay in touch and\nThat I Love you returned and went back down on them ...\nAnd early on a story goes away at a wishes hers had gone after rocky few years he and his father did get to know each other and each other's families I mean we had a son and you know how to grandfather million his father had left him when he was a baby but when his father died some years ago a millionaire was there at the hospital\nThey'd had a real relationship and that never would have happened a millionaire said if you hadn't seen him that day at the paramount\nDown the pyramid I was talking to allowed myself and I was saying that this is one congressman advertising forget don't drink you know [laughter] just started getting angry future though which I knew would\nRational as this event you know 'cause I I had the varied sense I've felt that this was actually a miracle something to the energy\nAnd brought us together you know you don't just run into your father on top of a pyramid so I think I Would believe her for about a week um and then Mm\nAnd then\nThat very pause that brings us back five what are the chances\nOrder to let a good coincidence live a long and healthy life to get told and retold and take its rightful place in the narrative of your life sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through why it happened really is the fact is any statistician will probably rain on your parade will tell you these things happen a lot more often than you think\nThat a good coincidence is like a good magic trick when you see one struggling sous instead", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
