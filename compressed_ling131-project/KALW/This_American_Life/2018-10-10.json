{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Boring politics is boring that happened right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading\nAbout judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and to me\nThis one feels the worst [noise] I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong that even watching it was a motion was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a\nMan's life or death [noise] with no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decision\nThey are not comfortable with all the [noise] the b._b._c. Chicago this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\nWas judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week\nTurn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face he dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over use undecided didn't seem like a no on Kavanaugh was yes and was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again a producers though ha to spend a\nLot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing\nWatching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nIs what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview [noise] just leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh he dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote and now he was stuff\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flicking declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination\nThat he was confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake can crumbled ... was one of the two women and that confrontation that her play good morning or good morning when that elevator door closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\nWho\nAre ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were the lots of others don't reading things like the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two\nWeeks and then people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed ... mind is not true first of all I saw him she just had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have any last year my also we talked about it wasn't the ... and there was a\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers\nIn for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat are you know when you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nClever having this or\nIt affects you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe ... making fun of himself talked about this before with lots of mend his age doesn't connect to well to emotion\n[noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both\nRare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nYou know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there's likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that trust\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nOr any decision on a vote\n'em it's been it's just it's\nA ... debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that it was very wrong you know [noise]\n... next morning of course we finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in it and you've got to come back to\nYou know for some sort of innocence\nHe goes to the elevator gets yelled at on TV and to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that flake the yes he choked up reportedly since OCE\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry\nA lot of tears in the capital those two days the meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably checks Twitter 'cause he usually does but\nHe says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR bit says he wasn't thinking about that at all so he comes back and then Coons give this speech at\nThe committee meeting that he said was directed at one man Jeff Flake they're actually friends there on the Foreign Relations committee together they've been all over Africa together too\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied that the FBI before [noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that's what we're only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNo chase is one of the students have a program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course as the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today in Chester potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through it well I like my own uh\n[noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n... ...\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe judge shouldn't be broadly read\nPolitical theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSome southern southern so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking ... cases always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explain this job\nHow it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nIf the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that\nIt's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you give\nAnd let's say five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realized one of us will have\nTo write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nUh an opinion that explains\nTeach the principles\nOf lord of the principles of the constitution\nThe control as a result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and\nSay an unpopular case uh we draw down on that capital of\nTrust we make a withdrawal and the trust that in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish [noise] that trust\nBy and hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell my story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play\nGolf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raise his hand he said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those\nBriefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have operate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera case\nWell the minute I that that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually for attention\nBut uh so I thought I'd lost your audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand is all I have a rule like that when I write those reason I said oh it is it are the ones that fact brave and it just expect [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nThanks to reform club the Palm Beach is from the recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur\nHas to decide to death sentence is only previous experience in these matters\nLaw and order that's in a minute Chicago public radio when our program continues\n[noise]\nThey can look normal [noise] whole normal conversations do everything you expect still have to see\nThe next step judgment the weight of the world stamped judgments ... beach do that ms\nJudgment and the next thirty three miners serum anyone point seven K. A. L. that'd be is you know thousands of veterans listeners supporters keep KLW independent and innovative\nAnd allow us keep our on our phone reason to a minimum you could join these good people and help to keep KLW local independent an innovative it's easy lean flick to donate a button at the top of camel W that all ah gee thank you so much\n[noise]\nJust American Life America lost today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that what about program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes stretching the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold scene and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan ways the kind of the bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight men received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing oh no I Hope it will give jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch and stuff like law and order and other things like that\nAt the EU criminal intent spend like them all he was a software developer newly married and he and his wife had just bought a new house is first\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nWho live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something fan never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out\nWith an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven my hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness it felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message and how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did begin to apply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] feel like a really read things are\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in ...\nThe mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing well should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to inertia\nAnd it's even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain unnerved until that has acted upon by an external force base in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShe also forwards originally emailed to spin the once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness but Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks banned for the article and says she shared it with her son\nOr tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that\nSpan consumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n... um no I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... [noise]\n... ah some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering the food that she can stop refusing you want to have a coffee or tea know\nMaryland has fallen stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always fly for the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain and\nHad a family memoir out is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and\nI felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nMm in in\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family\nHave all moved on [noise] so when Marilyn ... article\nShe signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay descendants the death penalty\nI thought I had that I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read an okay what are they thinking what are they doing 'em\nI wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved\nIn a heinous crime I think the true a monster but he went to the monster\n[noise] no okay so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for\nUs I think that probably in the event at the end fan yeah yeah\n[laughter]\nI Hope I can say before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice their fans spend is at the door [noise]\nAnd then I'm Jonathan it's very nice things going on here right now how do you\nStand there was no okay\nI get a lot of vent lingers in the door the hotel room and a half of it over there\nUh he's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in band and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than a re read it and I even began to her letters or never went anywhere I wouldn't want to say what did you say about that I don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I regret I thought I'm doing the wrong thing\nAlthough it was great hearings are forgave him couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how do you most bill\nFirst of all I Want to say I don't want you to feel shame because you know my son was involved in a in a in a crime um he made a wrong choice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "10"}
