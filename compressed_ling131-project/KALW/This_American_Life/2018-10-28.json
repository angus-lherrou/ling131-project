I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad\nBut I was terrified [noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out [laughter] and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with

was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing it or or entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because uh there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people that they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me\nBlah blah blah [laughter] but I\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\n\nThere are parts of your past you don't want to go back to ... parts

think of myself as where at all but Susan joined reminded me in the gentle terms possible when I was nine of anxious and bookish was kind of uptight\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that ... had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had a baby that ... just been more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nYou know perhaps the most amazing thing\nEven if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remember what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she must be remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever

started writing this diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude seconds me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam\nAnd wash out will generate here comes Adam was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's good that's the kind of amazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise]\nYeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth

read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nSixteen I have such an inflated sense of myself\nAnd I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know\nI mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it was just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be [noise] you know one of the great ... and\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel good knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation [noise] you know\nJust have your petty little craft and you're cutting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted [noise]\nTo be heard this this radio to ease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory origin I came to us from a graduate student Hillary frankly steady and try and get the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get 'em to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine and then to edit\nThe quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music to hear the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch your guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\nThere was the beginning of the school year and we were um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad\nAnd I guess basically got him on a on phones back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how magnificent and I'm actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord of effort that was pretty amazing\nTo me\nBecause I bought a lot about it um it actually good for me thinking along a particular path\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nGot talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the way to class\nHe saw signs all over campus that enabled me\nI Am nine feet tall\nCome see giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the plot at this time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nHe gave giant man a booming voice\nPart or even know exactly it was something like you know I'm trying to ... you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of\nThing [laughter] you know I don't know\nGot asked his college friends hold on to access giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrapped around their middle hide code\nAnd ... really ... like the guys and can\nWe picked up a point in the bushes put on and I um [noise] because I really couldn't see what was going on out of the ... and for the time came and I got on the shoulders base where they up like around my waist we walked out\nAnd I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people try\nAnd I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was rather as like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all coming to work for it right like you know what I'm like the way ...\n[noise] they decided to win
