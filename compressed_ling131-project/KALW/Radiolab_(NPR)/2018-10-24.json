{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOr listening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make and went on it yeah anyway\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon\nHappier so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling now that I'm supposed to their same\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies\nAnd they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest will turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global\nBat embattled Facebook CEOs boxer day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches [noise]\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by this photograph what we can\nSee and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nMr sacrifice I got to\nYou some jak laid prioritize or censor ...\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing is censoring speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so uh let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started at all [laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to\nSwitch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote that extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the\nTime when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic\nChanges this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice space dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had\nIn the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like ... ...\nAnd Peter and things that come up onto their screen flagged her to Facebook and\nOn Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of\nContent and then [noise] that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your ... leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nPrize Fight for the lights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group\nWho had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on social networking website is under\nFire for it and how long the motives of women right leading their children to twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in a bad thing is not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so Internet users resisting Dr phil it was a media storm and\nEventually perhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female breasts and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially\n[noise] well I thought I'm\nThat we\nFound out pretty quickly learn none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of renting femi happening\nA lot about the good work [laughter]\nBut now I I started by these you\nI Know you're lying in fact most people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that defined\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise]\nAre willing to do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather live\nThat's totally fine you know I was ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct for about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor traffic has\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact at ... ... yeah I tell you got so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ... sorry\nI just I guess what is high\nSize five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nYeah he he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell if if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThe last ... ... um it's too late to X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things federal\nHas exploded able to you know get squashed by attack to you know people cages ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh\nCatching self thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat were there were specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was why I like to look at ... ...

story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are there there's you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing on their kids in the room mate would fit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe and ways that are fair and consistent\nAnd I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen\nStrike and Carlin Rhonda Maryland but sorry but if I had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carla\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYou have sort of dust begins to settle\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured fix him up throws them in a wheelchair\nAnd as they are pushing him through this sort of ash cloud ah there's a photographer there and he snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photo shows the runner and the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are\nHis face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\n... meanwhile\nCBS studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several deaths staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders event here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however have to ... says\nIs worthy\nEssentially just photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPushback while I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff van other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher where would they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment\nAnd just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization friends' parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company\nBecause the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built product basically\n... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this uh\nAnd this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico\nAnd it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man with his face covered\nGrabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and\nThere'll be is covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed this strange phenomena\nIt first caught my attention and early two thousand ten should be checking social media you
