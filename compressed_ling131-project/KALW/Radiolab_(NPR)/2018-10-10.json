{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Stay tuned to local public radio\nFrom me\nBefore we start today's episode will be much to know this broadcast contains tape to describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned\nWay you're [noise]\nYou're listening to radio lab\nRadio from WNYC [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before ... say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly a king and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about ... each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right Jason Harris than to budge on her animals become sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies\nDon't for the most part and I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself\nIn the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate\nTo tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know because most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public\nConsciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records lawsuit\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper\nAny paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink Sir Ben put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of show back\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall we've\nGot um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\nBook or a thon boys and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\n... basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nBut the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings the represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought looked like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions didn't\nAll went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency\nTo keep track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they ... about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level a are that about a third of the\nQuote mentally unstable and this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been\nSays they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cops which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward a the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm gonna make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question\nWhat do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising\nThat a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very\nFar percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start this\nMethane gas fields just moved by the single case maybe the cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife and apartment to fight it out every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation but death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople who [noise]\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and Ben traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one\nOf those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm\nOr so after the event ended at the community center crystal took a bunch of Mondale gotten their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or you know for no one knows inland and has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning to part of just hoping right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a crystal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point 'cause it was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go to our house she says it's age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house into it and and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them into their own stories these stories\nHeather [noise] it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWith me in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know or the vice shows results like therapy for\nVicki slept in the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add\nMarlon promise to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so we usually the video that's\nMom's house probably over like right\nAnd then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are 'cause the guard and wants to hear and\nWing and all that\nBut I I Am saying 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released they sit down and take us that we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like is it not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm playing onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in your\nToday and it brings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nReal science or ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find the best model what about falling to me a couple of women handed me the phone\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and\nThey just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face alright three two one\nThree two one [noise]\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nWith us because I Know [noise]\nIt was also very ... we saw that once a week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you how do you live\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\n\nTo go there I saw\nYeah that was for how could you not\nIt ain't no way you like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know that is like a certain time every\nDay and it's just little white man we share\nEverything like that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI mean I don't know if you if it's a way out of going on in all of that and it's a little white guy they always say not\nBe taking ... I Can't hold\nI never I never do it on my [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nJews on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother watched\nWas lower than to the\nNews around the time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between\nSo stay with us\n\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about slow at W.

a nice coming out of the probably\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't just show your best shot actually if you want a guy you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is a thing that you guys would you use this video for what it is one\nOf a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into cornstarch that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause they're dies partner was holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun so you know he's\nPerson you're trying to rush to communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody is nameless faceless and I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood I mentioned on the front step ... what are you doing man dared does stupid sort of a bitch you don't have close game to be in that wouldn't be back with his medication ... wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment

county [noise]\nWhich the county that they told them each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nBig coalition appreciate a and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie the international association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but [noise]\nThere was this experience than I had read realized\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont
