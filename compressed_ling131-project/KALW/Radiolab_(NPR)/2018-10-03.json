N. Y. [noise]\nSome people like roses and others to lips oh I've always like snakes [noise]\nThis is radio lab I'm ... and I'm Robert Krulwich and our show today is about deception and we thought we're better to start than with snakes [noise]\nThis is where you keep all your snakes ... for some of them\nHere we have a right it is some lizards or working with\nThis is Gordon Burkhart he works at the University of Tennessee data visited recently and I have several rooms here where we keep a variety of different reptiles just one little snake and he likes to show off small guy man I just called the hub new snake he's all the all those\nThings they can see this guy is already starting to go into the the split\nGordon pops top off the cage and then do something interesting well do is think he puts a chicken puppet of a puppet of a chicken on his left hand right and then with this up and he begins to kind of attack the snake are mock attack in the late\nLike ... bird that might be attacking it what happens next is kind of shocking and you can see now ... is calling its tail first with the snake furtive ones back\nThere goes upside down then vomit blood what'll even come out of the mouse to then who is itself more\nAnd I noticed his friend is definitely a little bit it's rising\nIt gets to read the\n\nIn fact will stop breathing\nAnd it's all ... all the show it was like wait that is a black eye touching but as soon as we took a few steps back from the cage the snake pops up goes on flattened the Phillies and it'll come host and there was alive again and then\nAnd basically that's pretty good thank you very much although you know the world and it was kind of an ordinary life really what it was shut when was the last time you perjure yourself for a lot well I could like two years so beautifully you wouldn't be on your back tongue out no way 'cause I Would get you\nKnow you wouldn't get you what do you I Would totally get ... to tell you if that's not I would catch you know if it were me no you wouldn't so that's our our people who live and the people who catch them not to\n[noise]\nTo get things started in earnest let us go to every New Yorkers different spots [noise]\nJohn F. Kennedy Airport course rural place wants to get away you know\nI ended up there with our producer Alan Horn we hadn't actually meant to come to the guy that we had been interviewing\nDaughter for a large it'd be portrayed by demeanor and the rest of your heart emotional and right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call alert all that he had to run or that's where you are crap we have more questions over here to do so we decided to jump in the car within\nFriends men with guns\nBecause these guys are looked like there in combat uniform for Iraq and have automatic weapons naked Paul act man when he carries\nA a security expert and that's what he's become nowadays and speaking of security and the reason he's here today at JFK Airport is to talk with Jet Blue security teaching the few things about how they might do their jobs that are okay but in a\nFought over in a restaurant [noise]\nNot a general private security kicks his house\nWe are living in a terminal\nAnd the only place it seems we're allowed to stand other right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic accident finally pulled out the thing he'd been hoping to show the sub the Jet Blue\nHas your little you're\nVery stylish little laptop they are just starting off the simple computer program that he promises about forty minutes\nTeach here into a person's elsewhere shows and start start start\nStepping forward to the computer here the loading image is they have a best\nWay to reach the ...\nA gallon again that was so fast\nAll knew what\nHis promise I'll tell you but let me just keep going\nTo explain Paul ... studies faces the human said he's probably studied the face more than anyone\nUp until my work that was person Seventy eight we didn't really know how many expressions of face could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face\nSo about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression\nI developed tropical official action cutting system\nBasically a muscular scoring system you can apply to photographs feeling realized behavior you just do a one to for your your numbering my facial especially the one to the most common fingers were up to us raising your eyebrows office weren't too far it's just raising the upper Arctic serving his concerns are are\nAll in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks it's we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident running example yeah he demonstrated if you\nOK few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people can't voluntarily move\nYour ten senior I'm\nTouching their red margin of error that's\nEarly to click you looked fierce when you do that instantly so have you on the someone's mad look at their lips conversely if you want another happy genuinely happy and they're not just faking it he says look at their island skin\nIn between your eyebrows and Europe or are they in the genuine spontaneous and joins while that's good news lightly down\nHard to detect by visible you know\nYou just didn't like you said that anyway the reason that we're talking about him here an hour on lying is because with all the attention that being paid these days to finding life by using fancy brain scanners\nX. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the rain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control\nOf these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice\nOr the things happening on my face on her face on any faith\nFor Germany or no you don't even know that ... tried to make your face [laughter]\nWhich brings me to my new favorite word leakage leakage leakage yet it is a word you hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field of like catching take for example burying McManus area element managed him CNN us he's a longtime CIA interrogator physiological\nCould be anywhere from sweat gland activity when someone knows that they are misleading you and they break out in a sweat that because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of the\nCoating Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem\nBut your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do\nAnd what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it\nBut if you've been trained and you know what to look for corn ... man is it it will strike you right in the face\nSpeaking faces are talking about a particular brand of ... specializes in and to do with something that he called micro\nFacial expression and very fast facial expression about twenty says if a second\nOkay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling\nGames but on the inside is a vote to know you can attest maybe you got them reach a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that in a rage slips out onto your face\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd these are just little link to fleeting aggression that are usually pretty extreme but they're very fair skinned happens consciously says but so fast that most of us don't eat at all\nMost of the stuff they most everyone around Ninety five percent of us are what you're learning you know\nAnd what you don't win going back then you wake up to the start on the possibility that times are everywhere\n[noise] ...\nEnough to make sense to me or my daughter was born ... years ago or deciding on life you're going to leave my life without a line\nTo see whether you can feed her life without vying yeah that sounds very hostile it's very tough but I'm always looking to see whether there's a way I can solve the problem\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's office than I Would say okay and I would go\nBe the early you know to forty five\nAnd uh she would not be there at three Fifteen would roll around and three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is sort of computer you can I help you she would say oh without a doubt one was at one o'clock or I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed in it I could see the handwriting and indeed it was ... and\nShe signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as discontinued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in crystal clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he gets a call from a woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture she showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared\nLeaving the back behind so it was right around that point where a check down and I was like oh now and so through mutual friends she tracked down to ... I was kind of like OK well she has a boyfriend she called them call them and sort of wonder if that gives the enormous she had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even know she had a roommate mean lastly\nI mean who the hell was who are you know who are you you will mean money and no I don't and she'll you know it was all very confusing\nNot knowing what else to do Leslie decides to go into hopes for him and start looking through her spine I just like you know I'm just going to go through this see what's in here and that's when I found those notebooks\nBorrow ban that book\nAn inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them\nCredit card numbers mother's maiden name birth date\nSee on what exactly what the these are like crib notes for calm on them that's when I called Jude and I said get over here [noise] what did you\nDo at this point well do you knew he had to do something I finally got\nUp the courage\nTo confront hope and say\nMy own responsibilities are not withstanding to be um\nYou know pregnancy and what about Leslie at this point when she well Leslie wondered how many of those people in that notebook hoping not through Craig's list which is very lively met her she went back to Craig's list and started posting warnings\nMany times a day I\nThink the white female make specific case me the Gray Thursday twenty

rights she would\nPass no drama and not even take down\nShe would pose a fact of the matter is I Hope is out there than it would take it down but within a few days in those moments where I was in the

with tons of stuff bonds trying to pass a check out of the clergy countenance when it comes out over the course of several years there were testing priceless and there were people who were\nShe got kind of a celebrity following by the way we used to get emails like every day for people who were\nJust like is there any news dude I Love the nose for you tell us anything I'm like no she's in hiding sorry\nWho was this woman and you can I get you to introduce yourself if you are you\nMy name is Terri Larry on the special agent with the Louisiana department of justice\nLouisiana how'd you get to Louisiana after a few years hope resurfaced in New Orleans we\nHad a cold and complaints from a lady down in the New Orleans area or her credit card had been used someone that tried to purchase Dell computers and it just started from there every time we talked to one victim to lead to one or two other bit of hope has a almost like a cult following you know her ammo was that\nShe knew she got to know him really well\nI've talked to a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore\nA lot of these people did some good human open heart things with her and said\nThis to poor girl I've got to help her out and there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and it's sad you know not only do you have to worry about cleared up your credit than getting your money back from your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now that you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nShe just had that feeling\nHelp it blown through in San Francisco he had found something that was really upsetting I had come across\nA letter but she had written to my parents but never male and just sings and very very terrible things\nWhich Jude says we're totally untrue\nIn this letter to his parents hope for that [noise]\nAt at one point during\nPregnancy she was having complications and the the main symptom was like severe ... bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room\nAnd that um that I had that I just left\nTotally abandoning the situation in my responsibility in just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene [noise]\nCheapest traumatize the whole experience he compared to an earthquake\n[laughter] have you ever been an earthquake no never well\nOne of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place so that was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequence that was just\nYou to say\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ... and that was from was it didn't say September nineteenth or September fifteenth and said September Seventy to other\nPeople crying on the phone talking to me about this situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know that's when they become detective [laughter]\nMake lousy practice\nWhere are you know front of hopes mother's house in a bad\nNeighborhood in New Orleans and around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I could kind of gotten a little obsessed\nWith how he got upset\nWhy I have no idea [laughter] I definitely having technical tests I was telling her to there was something about imagining\nHow she was doing all this so nervous was like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie to it like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her\nMarcia Valentine Marcia Valentine\nThey're not around here that are going to live and what you mean everyone's ...\nI'll come back there\nOkay next right ... but what did you know about hope at this point well I knew that she had had a daughter\nWho really knows anybody\nYou know not choose\nThe timing was all wrong and I had locate\nThe father well I'm standing outside of hooked Smothers how shares through class of ... piled up against the ...\nI don't see any land inside the house\nNext morning I went out to find a woman named ruby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana wherever he owns a coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother someone who came to New Orleans um her mother you know\nIntroduced us really has a kid who's about the same it just helps daughter and they go to Montessori together and when really opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would pick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes\nAnd quite frankly I enjoyed having hope around\nTwo weeks later the cop show up to a raft hope\nShe had printed a check on her home computer with a made up account number divide twelve thousand dollar used\nHere you are you really like this woman your kids love her and you can't believe it you don't believe it and I wanted to stand by her I wanted to help her\nYou know and she hadn't screwed me over she hadn't done anything to me so\nMaybe she's turning around\nCard off the shelves that he put away because the credit card with maxed out\nAnd she'd been buying gasoline and paying her phone bill wasn't much was like two hundred and fifty dollars it really wasn't much and my husband was like oh why\nYou know inconsistencies big ones\nAnd then the hundred and eight folks that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they say ... or they pathological Arizona depends on how you define I Would hope that she found twelve people that she wanted\nTo look at further she said to them would you be willing to come out of purely voluntary basis into the lab and let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day of office\nOut basically put people in the scanner and then we scan their brain\nScanned everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or participants the liars and the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just be on there for it called the ...\nCortex and this is the part of the brain that\nPart of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and more judgment for example\nIf you do me into that place just behind you for him [noise]\nYou'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray matter and then you've got\nWhite men I've heard him gray matter yes well we think of the brain is being gray but actually too thick gray and white the great\nStuff kind of thing but it's like the computer processor part yeah these little clumps of neurons that process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nBetween all these cars on the computer the way met her in other words is move the thoughts around gray\nIs where the the thinking happens and then why is when you move the thought from here\nThey transfer information from one end to the ... because\nThey've got your grave that you're white ... thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people\nWho lie a lot I found out we would see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff less of the thinking why would why would\nBecause that's what she's seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where do you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have less great\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures that what you saw was such a great increase it\nAnd not the great more white matter\nWhite stuff a lot more\n... than a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI was really bubbling [laughter]\nI thought this was this was something something something something ... years her idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in\nA kind of in the moment storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example mhm you're leaving work you're walking on the elevator and annoying\nBut nice co worker corners you hey Sallie corners unique elevator\nHey\nAsks you out on you know\nI've been to ask you maybe want to go out with me on friday\nThere you are questions dangling in the air it's more than ...\nFor most of us right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking [noise]\nShe said that he made up my mind when he was on things I think the reaching out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm you know like any of them show on [noise]\nAnd really what you need to do at this moment it does take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like 'em me tonight teeth dentist and connect them all together [noise]\nSomething like that OK okay we can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with [noise]\nThey get their faster emitting at night and you do you think of winning and started writing your guy ... make\nThem more connection very beginning and then the fatty during the speed of the ... thing you can jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more um random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have would you have trouble if I said you like a couple of hours you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ...\nI Would say yeah they um\nI have to drive to count straws to assert searching struck county we always we have about three hundred and sixteen stress over and uh I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with little red circles on them so that's certainly not sorry\n[laughter] I don't know I just stopped there you go see you've got you've got extra white men or ... [laughter]\nSo she's saying this is a cause of lying or an effective lie like\nShe's not sure and this is a big debate in which he can say is that children as they grow\nI'm In the white matter oh\nAnd that's actually the same age that they give up the skill to ally\n... among [noise]\nClose ... given everything we've just talked about how do you square this\nInformation with being a new mom I mean is this your first get yes it's my first one a boy or girl again yeah what's her name ... doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her\nHead Oh yes I Want to know about that all of the times it's still too early to scan her brain but [laughter] eventually I Will do it are you serious yes\nThis is a moral to this never if you're a little baby have a social psychiatrist as a mother to the very very dangerous thing maybe way if she does this maybe one a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then\nThis is radio lab and we'll be back in your brain [laughter]\nHello I'm Jeff Hayden this Wednesday on your legal rights landlord tenant law and news our discussions will include current bottom initiatives\nBoth state and local some say they pose allusions or this or just they pose for their problems will be discussing just what these initiatives do that's your legal rights Wednesday night at seven o'clock right here on KLW FM Ninety One point seven in San Francisco or online at K.

I'm Robert and this is radio lab today on our program the topic is liar\nAll kinds of liars and now it's time for the liar we haven't yet mentioned or a liar which might actually be wonderfully huge and this is the uh the self deceive or have somebody\nSomebody who lies or not to others but actually lives to oneself and get my drift thanks ... anyhow what is that even mean well lie to oneself how would you be trickier me give you a classic example let's say that you are madly in love with\nSomebody who just to conjure up whoever you really you know I don't know who okay so now you're in love with her and strange things start to happen\nHere at home the food rings you pick it up [noise]\nPerson on the other on the line is breathing and then [noise]\nThings up next she suddenly staying late at the office many nights a week didn't used\nTo that honey I'm I've got to work late tonight again don't wait out\nThen your friends tell you that they see this woman who who's this\nGuy in the company of ... brother maybe repeatedly come on [noise]\nIn short all the signs are there and yet despite the evidence you jet continue to believe it I mean you truly truly believe that the woman is being faithful well maybe in this little scenario that you've created for me I'm just\nA stupid are clueless [laughter] I'm not going to take that away from you I'm not but in this case though for the sake of argument let's say you're not cool okay let's\nSay you believe both these things in some different compartments in your head you believe that she is faithful and it's a very same time you know\nYou know what's going on here what self deception really is is that you have two contradictory beliefs and you hold them at the same time and you allow one of them into consciousness\nTo consciousness that's Joanna start she's a psychologist and we're going to hear more from her\nLate right so how does that work than what what you just said that to have two contradictory thoughts and your brain at the same time and yet you're on that and then one\nWell there's an experiment on this subject kind of an interesting one and so\nOne of the experiment introduce you to the two guys who did it as okay\nI'm a a Harold set time limit professor in the departments of psychiatry and radiology at the university okay\nMy name is Rubin who were on a new rose psychologist by training\nHarold ...
