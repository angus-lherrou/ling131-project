G. the times ten o'clock\nEight jet here before we start today show just won't let you know that this episode contains descriptions of violence and sexual violence and it is probably not suitable for young children so if you've got young children in the room or if you're not feeling it for it just be warned\nWait you [laughter] [noise] and\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from there'll be you and why [noise]\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm rubber crow which is radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral brought us this story and under whose skin or he also seems to have got yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist from newspaper guy for the post aren't glimpse Bob's he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping out around ... pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to the campers\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they thought was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other two campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are\nThe kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids were spread out to the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening to the man stabbing ... stuck and I\nHad been five times in a chair\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nButton demand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch\nNext to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest and not began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nOur there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict\nHe'd been in prison for rape ... seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are short of arts people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers sides a manhunt dragged on what happened was Garrett was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive\nDay after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him and uh\nSeventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Darrow\nThese freeze\nOr drop your gun something to that effect and Carol started running\nLow block fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nBut you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThe\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but he wouldn't talk and it's at\nThis point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor lethal Armand again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani\nBreakage army\nThe lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole stories start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I'd like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defending your fighting the state and ... and he was doing really well\nHe has well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro\nYeah black you're strong back to ... you need a forty five and a or to head the field I mean this guy is dangers and love of things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the men and Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers you represented him at first on two pretty small things\nOne one school teacher has a shelf to his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to them a little bit and then head on all of them will be ... I remember that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then become picture for\nOh let's see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Garrett was released on bail he skipped this court date\nAnd just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from girls life\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and that tells you provider of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father so there's some a road that goes to the minded or what is fair to them on it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nBecause I'm very icy that day the share this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here\nTo write up here we are in our son do shoots and rebuild trudging choose for is looking for [noise]\nSpent hours look [noise]\nFrom this was her friend to allow\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across\nThere for this or get any such yeah you don't want to fly down in there and so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe of blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this bitch does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your\nMoney back up very\nEventually algae found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Guerra headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's see how that play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if people are already dead than you ... the the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of him or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of ... just tell tell\nOf course yeah soon I knew Mr hawk from bowling who's who's the other daughter or my daughter were in the same slash and I knew him from church\nAnd wanting to be an animal\nOf the family and then you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what has [noise] coming up that hard but it's even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\nFor me from Arlington, Texas radio a lot of support in part by the Alfred P son foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology\nAnd the modern world for more information on the line at WWW dot ... dot O.

I'm I'm Rhonda I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right and they knew they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThey take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a Christian also right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take it a little\nWell that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so\nJim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney harmonies office and when they met army ... search the briefcase us up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug because their parents there's going to be\nPresent the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies I Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nThe whole there you're talking about Susan and only show like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive and Belgian said I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal\nAnd Lisa told me about this panel she organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer the ... job\nA ... I was a good lawyer and\nI thought so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if\nPeople face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up\nHe represents his client's best interest if you and in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely used because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can see in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... ... ... ... ...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's in the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machine camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law school and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what\nIs considered to be correct\nAre 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things\nIn an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out\nTo yes it was yes you are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes\nMaybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victim\nAnd I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and\nAnd went to the police station and\nSitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's\nMy daughter's boyfriend what his body was found\nAnd that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and\nObviously there was no closure and it was just\nAnd then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as just sitting a lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing more months\nAnd that's why they think taught law schools\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could\nAny of those possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk\nTo you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience yeah well it's\nImpossible to really communicate words\nI made forty years later I'm Still\nI I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss because you don't ever go away as long as I\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um south south I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about\nI'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was\nShe did receive her degree pass too much sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had bad just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and so to me\nAnd I'm sure the other two children get great future I had a true and\nJust a horrible tragedy\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] so it's horrible to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter were one of the ... for protecting the person to kill her\nNew justification you couldn't just took my mind\nExpect [laughter]\nBut we lose\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here so it's okay\n[laughter]\nEchoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the [noise] the hill kind of bounce around um that water I think it's\nTrue deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's dripping everything up here is frozen solid so what that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn background\nThrough wish I'd
