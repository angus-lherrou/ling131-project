[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's time now to practice some very useful praises I saved them first you repeat I remembered and together that's but yeah\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin\nWe'll have five experiments in translation trench creation\nLesson number one the best words by my mother got cut off the people who remember you know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which is a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in in a next our producer levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class from one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long\nStint sausage beautiful often you know three syllables per line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize did I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card was written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and he'd gotten sick flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay it's called a ... ...\nOh so to speak accumulate they affect young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't look boom through Lucy ... ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the top ... to ... to ... to ... about it the hard on them for ... to dwell on the boat and I'm young\nI'm like I didn't have gotten so many checks and you were I was really [laughter] exactly\nThe opposite I was I was [laughter] I Wish [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have it\nTranslates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy\nNone of the new loopholes and if you just focus on the words and basically just the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam fee too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped bailed out or you know it's sort of like get better here's your good health drifted want something done I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted in us and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last lying I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poem loan to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per low you didn't ya ya or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast fee on to the top ... used to like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed I had a lot of\nPossibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in your head of slurping slop in in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't AOL very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick band you're a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health being near my sweet dear\nAnd I I like the ones on jam became bread though the bread and butter\nButter ... yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on ...\nLike just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French\n[laughter] and I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark\nHalls and bank\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with ... Clement who calls from\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous\nYou got the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but\nDoug said no no there's a bigger problem was thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was\nA form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue it was a form that's what made the things funny charming until the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat one regard oh too hard to your colleagues friends chicken D.
