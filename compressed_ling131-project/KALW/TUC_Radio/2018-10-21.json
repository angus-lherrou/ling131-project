federal government wanted to establish a national banks or give away half\nThe country to private speculate is or subsidize industries or set up commissions to fix prices\nAnd interest rates were manufacturers in banks or send Marines to secure corporate investments in Central America or imprison people who spoke out against war and capitalism or deport immigrant radicals without a trial or

actions acceptable\nWhen the federal or state government sought to limit workday hours set minimum wage or occupational safety standards ensure the safety of consumer products guarantee the right of collective bargaining or in other ways offer protections against the powers of business\nThen the court historically ruled that ours was a limited form of government that could not tamper with property rights and the free market by depriving owner and worker of substantive due process and freedom of contract\nConcepts that elevated to Supreme status even though the limitations\nConstitution in fact those phrases themselves don't\nWhen Congress outlawed child labor the court's conservative activists majority found it to be an unconstitutional used a patient of the reserved powers of the state's under the tenth amendment\nBut when the state's themselves past social welfare legislation the courts founded in violation of the fourteenth amendment ... the justices used the tenth amendment to stop federal reform initiated under the fourteenth amendment\nAnd they use the fourteenth amendment to stop state reforms initiated under the tenth amendment\nYou can't get any more activist than that the fourteenth amendment adopted in Eighteen sixty eight\nSupposedly to establish full citizenship for blacks\nAnd freed slaves says that no state so make or enforce any law was shell abridged the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United states\nNor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor denied to any person within his jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\nOnce again the court decided that person in the fourteenth amendment included corporations and that the fourteenth amendment was intended to protect big business conglomeration\nThey also decided that it wasn't to apply to black people in the case of segregation they also decided that it didn't apply to women for some reason women were not persons\nA test case reached the Supreme Court in Eighteen Seventy five the justices unanimously decided that women were citizens but citizenship did not necessarily can for the right of suffrage when women try to get the vote under the fourteenth amendment\nSo the court had made up its mind that privileges and immunities of citizens due process and equal protection the laws apply to persons such persons as business corporations but not to women and persons of African descent\nYou are listening to we broadcast of talk on the Supreme Court by the political analyst lecture and also off twenty three books Michael ... from a twelve part series entitled democracy what went wrong\nProduced in Nineteen Ninety five\nWell into the new deal era the Supreme Court was the activists bastion of laissez faire capitalism it's struck down all sorts of reform legislation [noise]\nFrom Nineteen thirty seven on would under the pressure from the public and the White House and with the switch of one conservative justice to the side of the liberals the Supreme Court finally began to accept the constitutionality of popular new deal legislation\nWell traditionally the court has opposed restrictions on capitalist economic power it has supported restrictions on the civil liberties of persons who agitated against that power\nThe first amendment says Congress shall make no law of bridging the freedom of speech or of the press\nYet ever since the alien and sedition acts of Seventeen Ninety eight Congress and the state legislatures have passed numerous laws to penalize the expression of politically heretical ideas as subversive or the dishes\nDuring the first World War almost two thousand prosecutions were carried out mostly against anti capitalists who expressed opposition to the war including the U.S

irresponsible news reports than any kind of criticism that those in power find intolerable\nAmericans were never given their freedoms they had to organize agitate and struggle fiercely for whatever
