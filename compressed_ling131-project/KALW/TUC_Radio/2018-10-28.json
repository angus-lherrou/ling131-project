{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "The idea of Israel is the idea that the Jews of the world have the right\nTo create in the land of Palestine their homeland\nAnd to gather all the Jews around the world to be part of a new Jewish nation states where the Jewish rights for self determination would be exercise or Jews would feel safe from anti Semitism and persecution\nAnd where they could uh exercise that culture tradition and identity [noise] what is interesting about this idea that originally it's not it was not a Jewish id\nIt's Christian ...\nBack in the seventeenth century that idea of Israel was conceived in Europe\nWhere if ... priests in sync has had the notion that you can have the kind of a double bill if you think of sending the Jews\nYou can get rid of the Jews these were anti Semitic ... Christians they wanted to get rid of the Jews of Europe so one part of the bill is you'll send them to Palestine\nThe other one will see a logical if the Jews returned to Palestine this night Pacific the second coming of the messiah\nAnd the ... of the dead\nAnd the conversion of the Jews\nTo Christianity or their shit about being in hell if they refuse [noise] Benjamin Netanyahu should be told about it because his greatest friends in this country a Christian Zionists who have this image\nOf barbecuing Jews in in ... if they will not convict Christianity on doomsday\nThis idea became far more serious project when Jewish thinkers and activist in central and Eastern Europe adopted it in the late Nineteen century\nBecause they adopted the ideals the return to Palestine not because of Christian evangelical views and not because they wanted the Jews to lead to Europe actually most of the Jews wanted very much to stay in Europe\nThat the Europeans do not allow the states and Europe so the idea was born out of two impulse\nThat wish to be safe and it was not safe to be a Jew in late Nineteen century central and Eastern Europe\nAnd they wish to redefine Tuesdays and\nAs a national movement\nEveryone in Europe in the late nineties century we're redefining stuff and nationalism was the most attractive way of redefining yourself as a more than ...\nAnd the Jews had below those objective features in their face and religion that lend themselves to read the initiative to the isn't not just as a religion but also as a national identity\nSo the idea of Israel became a Jewish idea not just the Christian and Jewish activists began to work for the idea of the return of the Jews the Palestine as a project of celebration but also as a project of redemption\nThe problem was with the project of redemption not with the idea that the Jewish thinkers who saw themselves as honest believe that they would the descendants of the Jews were expelled by the Romans two thousand years before that was not the issue\nWhether they were right or not is not very important but they felt that they were the descendants of the Jews who live during looked at the Jews believe was the second sample\nAnd that that temple was destroyed by the Romans at this time of Christ and that they were expelled and though actually were looking to coming back home after two thousand years of ...\nWhat the problem with every damn ... was not the validity of the ... the problem with a redemption was that someone else was living in Palestine stance\nSo what do you do if you want to return to a safe place if you want to read you find yourself as molten nation if you want to redeem what do you think is the old ancient homeland in someone else's lives in your homeland\nWhen you know what people did here when they found someone else living your genocide the natives of America as ... as the people of New Zealand\nAre certain thoughts of Africa we call that the movement of Europeans\nFlees Europe because up pissed accused and looking for a safe New Haven outside of Europe we call that movement said look alone yeah these\nPeople want to\nReplace the indigenous population so that they can build themselves a safe haven and nation states instead of the people who live there sometimes for centuries sometimes for millennia\nSo the problem with the idea of Israel began when they wish to find for the Jews a safe haven and to allow them to redeem in ancient homeland was encountered with a reality on the ground that someone has was already living there\nAnd like so many other settlers along and movements the ideal of the new states could do not include the indigenous native population\n... scientist painters drew beautiful\nPictures of Palestine in the late Nineteen century and the early twenty century but if you look closely at these paintings and you know the landscape you can see that the villages do not appear on the heels\nThat the Arab neighborhoods do not appear in the cities that the Palestinians are absent from the pictures and from the early ... century from the focus\nAnd they also don't appear in the boys and they don't appear in the fiction and then don't appear in the early films and that's was ominous but the Palestine has been up to understand that because if someone doesn't right to vote you if someone doesn't include you in the painting\nThere is a likelihood that when they would have the power that would also take you out of the country\nAnd the main problem with the idea of Israel later on was\nThat part of the idea of aging and Jewish nation state was wish to have a democratic states because these like European Jews who really subscribed to what was good in Europe\nWhether it was liberalism socialism democracy human rights of civil rights\nAnd understood from very early on that if you want to have a Jewish democracy you need to deal with the demography\nHow can you have the first election in a newly found a Jewish state if the Jews are not the majority what will happen with the Palestinians vote for the idea of a Jewish nation homeland probably not\nAs long as the Nike surgeries on her words the ideals is read was based on either a wish or an active plan to get rid of the Palestinians\nAnd they start going off the unity arrived in Nineteen forty seven Ninety four to eight when\nBritish ruins Palestine for Thirteen Years decided to have enough over the place prefer the question of Palestine to the United nations\nAnd\nAllowed design his movement to decide bite cells how to sustain the idea of Israel with this 'cause I'm from the wish to build a Jewish democracy on the one and and the demographic reality where the Jews are a minority in Nineteen forties\nAnd most of them came just three years earlier this is why the Palestinians do not accept the United nation idea that Palestine should be divided between the settlers who should have more than half of the country and the natives\nNo national liberation movement at that time agreed to half of the country to a movement that they deemed as the settler movement or as a colonial this movement\nSo this was not a solution and the result was the neighboring Arab states who were pushed to act in Palestine because designing women began already in the last days of the mandate to expand the Palestinians from Palestine\nArab states didn't want to do much about Palestine were pushed by their own public opinion to send contingents into Palestine on the date the British Left by the side on the fifteenth of may Nineteen forty eight that
