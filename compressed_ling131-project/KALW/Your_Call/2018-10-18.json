E. D. E. A.\nRetested Jones is co artistic director of the San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey which is celebrating its forty if here and she directs them adapt project a performance workshop committed to incarcerated women's social and personal transformation\nAnd ... joins us in Studio ... thank you so much for coming in good morning thank you for having ... amazing about your work is you have been doing me too deep deep work for decades\nYes don't going so far you know I just want to share a personal story when I first moved here and I think it was Ninety five I saw one of them adapt projects performances at the year but when a Center for the arts it completely changed me\nCandlelight you must have seen candlelight yes it\nWould say you have you but you bring women who are incarcerated onstage to tell their own stories and I'll never forget looking at the prison guards who were in front of the stage and they told the audience please leave right up after the performance and so these women can have a little bit of time with their families\nYes and uh God Bless 'em my Tennessee who was the chef at that point you know and uh we had great conversations he and I and I would just be I Would I Would get an idea in the shower I tell people them with their project kind of came to me in the shower\nAnd I said I'm going to go down and talk to the sheriff and he was very open about art and he really understood and believed that art cars save lives and so he I I Would tell him what I wanted to do and he's a ... ... okay well you know he said well how can we do it and I said well you know because that was there were also deputies\nThat we're really interested in the process because I was out of San Bruno for a long time and they were just going to come by and watch the process of people crying you know in the ... the beach you know [laughter] you know you know you've got to come with the real you tell the truth and shame the devil yeah\nWhat are your thoughts about this moment we're in right now given all of the work that you have done I sometimes wonder about people like you when you go to bed at night and you think about where we're at an all the work you've done how are you making sense of this well\nI watch new I watch all the news on television and of course it gets to be repetitive and it's not always you know pick up people will criticized social media but I feel like\nThe the larger news of a a productions on television either all talking about the same thing and they're not talking about things that we are you know we know about this as activists and as artists\nAnd at the same time I can't look away and so then I'll I'll use it kind of a drift off to sleep and then I have to watch some comedy after watch David Chapelle I Love David spell and that's how I kind of get off to sleep but I it's we're in a freefall where the freefall and\n[noise] ... and ... the ... story is that these women sharing the prisons are sell heavy talking about the seven year olds who wanted to protect her newborn sister from their grandfather and this is just one story can you can you also talk about\nWhat happens to us society like ours that that tries not to go there that you're you're pressured under the rug as a society\n[noise] because when we heard from these women talking about the teacher the boyfriend partner or whoever it was that assaulted them it's almost like it's in on the surface yeah and we we tend not to really go deep into that trauma in this country\nAnd we and what we will realize eventually is that we're only we only encouraging people to bring half of themselves you know uh to do as we're talking about the the freefall\nWhat's gonna happen in twenty Thirty years you know what's gonna happen politically if people are holding on to these horrible memories and all but I don't think it's going to I think that the doors open up being in South Africa you know I work in South Africa and um\n[noise] I met a young woman who was when I met her she was like Fifteen\nAnd uh she had already been in prison for three or four years\nAnd she and her brother this is ... she and her brother had found out from their younger cousin\nThat this doctor who was a veil well known in their particular community was assaulting this nine year old girl and she told everybody nobody would listen this girl and she had a brother were twins it's very mythical he was also in in jail you know\nWhich they had dug a hole\nThey really really they actually pushed him into the hole and set it on fire\n[laughter] and and she said well nobody else was doing anything and he shouldn't even be allowed to live and walk around and I'm looking at our babies these are our cubs you know and ah she said well nobody was doing anything\nAnd still they had to do time but she said but at least he won't be out they're hurting other kids you know and it's like\nOkay ... what what you warned about is don't judge me you know we have lived too long\nWith everybody holding onto these horrible secret and really they're not secrets right like you're describing people calling in to your show and that's what we've got to realize they're not secretly\nAnd I just want to acknowledge Laura winter is our producer just wrote me and said several men called end but most of them are not even able to speak\nYeah\nAnd you know the shows are so intense that I kind of forgot to even talk about that because it it was just so intense these stories but we were so I guess grateful that we can have this place that space where people feel comfortable to call in and share their stories\nBut you know for an also for guys males and this is something\nI'm Still working on with young women who uh Rome shakers get paid bling\nAnd I say you know do you really think about the guy you\nKnow because he has to play style which is a play the man he has to be a even a ... a bit larger than life so that gives him the right to punch you to get you to abuse you at the same time\nWhat do we bring to a relationship when it's really about pay my phone bill buy me a car you know and and and and guys have been taught\nThat if they can they do you know and you think about the men who couldn't even talk about the shame so intense because they can't even talk about being insulted 'cause it's too much like ... ... excuse my French but uh they treat you like to pitch\nAnd what does that mean for me you know it's like they treat you like a woman you know so that's why you can't is that what we're talking about you know but I really believe that bitch dance for being in total control of herself\nThat's what I that's what I Believe you know yeah I Know and I'm trying to do that I don't work as much of young men anymore but when I Do\nOne of my main questions for them as the do you want to live with do you want to die because they don't know they don't do any more that you fall fall\nAnd then don't forget the police riding up in there and you know they're scared you know and also they have the guns they're an organized legalized game you know so they and the wars on you know even if a boy runs away or a man runs away it's on you know\nToday we're speaking with her death at Johns co artistic director of the San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey they're celebrating their forty F here she also directs them a dam project a performance workshop committed to incarcerated women's\nSocial and personal transformation and ... says latest piece is called when did your hands become a weapon\nAnd it's a project that she created with him adapt project and the women's HIV center at UC SF it explores the trauma and realities of domestic violence and sexual assault and it offers a pathway to healing and also to prevent further trauma\nIf you're in the bay area you can see when did your hands become a weapon from October ... to November fourth at the ... theater in San Francisco and if you'd like to join us you know if you'd like to talk about the time that we're in what you're thinking about right now if\nSeven nine eight eight to five five if you've seen where does this work and want to talk about just how powerful it is to see these women share their stories onstage weak lead lead left to hear from you you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\n[noise] ... ... talk about the process involved of these women sharing their stories with complete strangers putting it all out there how does it affect them\nBecause you know I I'm I've senior stuff for years and you have some at the same women working with him how they've been on how have they been affected by that process\nAt first I think it would I realize happens is\nThat when we speak myself 'cause I I anybody to ask me how do you do it you've got to be willing to put your stuff on the table\nYou you can't play teacher director and sit back you've got that's how you lay a path\nYou talk about where you've been and I see that now that my company my company what they're probably just a Thirty Years' older so many people in the group they know that it's about a spring bringing our stuff out and then the prisoner the uh women living with HIV um the ex offenders\nThey realize that there is that there is a voice to be found and I do a lot of theater games you know just the warming up the voice moving around opening the body you know our jumping rolling teaching women how to get mad\nGet mad but what does that look like we used to have a ... we used to have a a ... um the no of course it was all little girls and it was just them how can you say no and I remember my\nParents and grandparents coming in and being freaked out why are you telling them about this stuff I said trust me they already know they just don't know what to do and so your question it's it's a theatrical process but it's also the first thing that I found happens if I start to speak my own truth is that\nIt gives women a platform to to voice their concerns you know and we and the other night\nInside one of the women who are who say Chevy positive but you just been through it she was talking about I'm\nJust you know being a junkie on the street and I saw the women's side\nThey start to look at her and look at us differently like well this is real you know because they realize this woman was telling tales that they already knew and ... and she Deborah she gets to expound\nAnd share and teach so as you're back to your question I think it makes everybody a bit a bit stronger and a bit more focused as to what you can do with your life\nAs a just a wise woman I mean if if we can be all activists wonderful but it's like back to my little neighbor\nI mean it's my I Am an elder I Am as as a I think Maya Angelou said you know\nI Am the mother to all bringing them all to me and that's kind of large but I Love that it's like I Love the vets where I Am now you know I mean I feel like the kids just love the little bit but I sure like to sit around and make a good cake and drink some tea or some wine and\nPass this jealous of truth around and everybody gets to even feel it or sick from it yeah\n[laughter] [noise] retested Jones is co artistic director of San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey\nAnd if you're in the bay area I Hope you get a chance to see her newest performance when did your hands become a weapon and explores the trauma and realities of domestic violence and sexual assault and also offers a pathway to healing and really focuses on what it will take to prevent further\nAt the ... theater in San Francisco and if you're not in the bay area we have a lot of listeners who are outside of the area if you go online you can search for a

know it's a it's a and and I kept\nHearing all the stories and I thought how do I bring this to the forefront again because I'm limited probably has always talked about domestic violence and it it gets kind of scary because it's just part you know for women and jailed but when I when I have to jump up and down and ran and say you know but it's not okay\nIt's not okay to be handled to be mishandled to be misused and it's like we have to find ways to push back\nAnd it became exercises um when I was in South Africa year or two years ago um I talk to the women there about um about violence domestic violence\nAnd that was a woman who was Hindu who was in one of my workshops and she eventually it was in the performance because we make a big performance in the prisons in South Africa\nBut she told I I Do prompts as well I'll give a ... like love they'll love nobody right about it and this woman who wrote about\nHer uh her husband losing his job and then leaving\nAnd she and her three children were like really homeless they had no no for food no money\nThe man shows up and decides that he loves her and he wants to take care of her and he and he says your children will never be hungry\nWith me so she goes home with him [noise] and at first she said it was okay but he kind of\nGradually turned into the devil you know it was like everybody was too comfortable everybody was it she says that she noticed that he started to slap her around in the kitchen and she's feeding her children\nUh she's saying the children just eat eat eat eat and then he started to illegally rape her an assault or in the kitchen in front of her children you know I'm a trauma\nAnd she says she's on she says I'm screaming eat eat don't look eat and uh you know and this is the power of women though and she says one night\nWhen she couldn't take it anymore she ran into the bedroom where she was she slept with this man she said that I went to the pillow we always kept a loaded pistol and she said I threw it at him\nAnd went off into bullets hit him and he died two days later\nAnd she said to the audience ladies and gentleman that is why I Am in prison and the the therapist at a natural Rena prison they gave it to me and they said okay we need so your nose me I said there really are no notes other than that I told her to be right about love don't love nobody\nAnd the atmosphere was such that she trusted and our children were there they were there to bear witness to their mother's story and I was and I felt\nI felt like such a part of it and that all of a sudden\nThey are it is not just did this this dark secret of a terrible mother it was like they got to see their mother live it again and they lifted again and ah they were standing in the back of the theater at the end of the evening\nTears you know and what they were thinking you mean they were thinking the other women for helping their mother given their mother a I'm a platform and which to tell the story they lived it wow\nHow much time to this woman get in jail\n[noise] ah she was doing a seven to ten wow yeah for\nFor murder and you reminded me there's a documentary called sin by silence and it's about women in California who are in jail for murder and are trying to murder they're abusive partners and these women are\nMost of them are over sixty a lot of them look like your next door grandma yeah yeah I mean this is well you know we'd only across the country but that particular talk is about California well you know the culture back to um you know\nI'm ... ... women are voting for Kavanaugh back to women loving Trump or\nIs just a piece of it but it's like how dare you as a bad girl and how dare you act out being a bad girl you know oh and I'm fighting back\nI grew up in the house and my dad was my dad was my hero and he loved to me but I remember I got to a couple of fights with my brother's over real stuff and my father was so done with me\nHe said what are you trying to do you know you're you're you're a girl you're not supposed to be fighting your brothers and he said you know don't be so hard at it I had a one woman show and title big but girls harder that women my father used to say to me go such a big butt down don't be so hard at it\nAnd it was like this whole thing of like he flipped on me it was like no no you cross the line and that's where these women are dealing with they cross the line you know it's like you did what you fought back it's insane we're back to South Africa\nThey got time taken off their sentences for completing my project wow yes that's different because it's already said that her these stories then that hurts them you know and it was wonderful to be like in a situation where the women were going to you know sometimes a bunch of the year\nYou know it gets us because you finished this project which they saw as difficult the authorities saw it as being\nBut they love the idea of this American you know coming in and saying this is what we've got to do we're going to like open up and we got to share with the community with our families without children why we're in prison and and what that would tell there's a lot of things and we'll do a lot of things yeah have\nYou ever proposed that tell authorities and the U.S [noise]\nNo I ... you know as we're talking about it but you know uh even that at the jails and lord knows I'm grateful that I get to come in with my crew but this law and order time and yeah\nIt's law and order time and they put in and I don't know where when the decrees coming from but it is not what it was it not this is this a environment and that it was\nYou know we do a lot of shows about ... spent a lot of time with women and presidents have you noticed any changes in the last couple of decades in terms of how they're treated the kind of food they eat that relationships with the guards I mean I'm sure things probably change when you leave ... but have you seen any changes\nI well I tell you the change that's most abrupt some strange that they're getting some ... they're getting much younger oh\nYeah uh and um I think that's back to South Africa the wardens as they're called\nThey came to me and said we want to do this we want you to help us to tell our stories because they had to live on the prison grounds they were dealing with abuse and violence but there was like this was their take on that versus here in our country\nI think that uh we're still you're locked down and you're you are like um [noise] a guilty until\nAnd we don't know how we don't know how to embrace a different kind of reform now that people in and out of the system yeah but overall\nThere's like a right now I'm dealing with um a reentry program where culture as he's been funded but as a part of the jail thing here but it's about where these women gonna go holiday how are you preparing them to to embrace the workforce\nAnd that same time I'm saying I can do so much but that they've got to have medical psychiatric\nAttention you know to deal with trauma to deal with addiction you know all these things have to be um [noise] have to be in place and we're not ready to hear that or\nYou know we we're you know this is how do you say it you you get yours like I got mine you know you get a buffer you need to stop whining and complaining and it's the American away right\nAnd and the ... you might have a bus ticket to get out of here and the middle of the night the than the jails\nA women leave oh they put they release women at four in the morning before in the
