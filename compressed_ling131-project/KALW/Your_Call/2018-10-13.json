and welcome this is your calls friday meaty around tables I'm Renee camp in today for rose Aguilar thanks so much for being with us it's going to be a fascinating hour\nToday we are committing the entire hour to talking with Mother Jones award winning investigative reporter Shane Bauer he's here today to discuss his new book it's\nCalled American Prison a reporter's undercover journey into the business of punishment for four months beginning in twenty fourteen\nWorked as a nine dollar an hour prison guard\nAt the CIA which stands for Corrections Corporation of America as a facility it's called the when\nCongressional Centre located deep in the woods in the middle of nowhere in Louisiana or try to get a mental picture of just that surrounding\nAs we talked to shame about his experience in twenty Seventeen or the company was running more than eighty facilities everything from state prisons and jails to a residential reentry facilities\nAnd and even including federal immigration detention centers are but Shane Bauer had um a unique experience it is almost unheard of for a reporter to be able to gain this kind of access especially to today's privately owned Britain so we're particularly great\nThanks for being here thanks for having me well you're not to have a report or if you're an investigative reporter I should say and part of um part of your experience was actually in being in Iran and your work there had you in prison\nIn Iran so talk about that experience and why for heaven's sake after that experience would\nYou come back to the states and then choose a story that would put you again behind a wall\n[noise] well ah I was living I'm into does need to does nine in Syria in Damascus or where I was working as a reporter I was reporting around the middle east or Baghdad solution or a Yemen um and\nI took a trip with some friends ah two Iraqi Kurdistan I wasn't actually reporting on this trip um we just went for a week or we're in a\nUh the Kurdish area which was considered safe for ... and actually had a small tourist industry the time or we were at a went to a a local tourist site near sold them any uh uh which was a waterfall and there were a lot of kind of Kurdish families camping around there\nAnd we hiked the trail uh we we hiked quite far and we unknowingly near the Iran Iraq\nBorder um we were\nBack into by some soldiers who we thought were Iraqi Kurdish soldiers and turned out the Iranian or they just hate us and that led to a a two year saga of um you know us or simply being used as kind of a political chips between Iran and United States\nHow conditions are the conditions were were difficult I was in a political prison I'm I was in solitary confinement for four months or the rest of the time was was so isolated um I I was in a cell with ... with my friends are\nBut was otherwise cut off from the outside world for the most part um\n[noise] and ah we were blindfolded we left ourselves a people there were most of them were pro democracy activists who had been arrested for street protests and some were tortured and physically [noise] um\nI mean most in most medium security prison guards would have pepper spray at least um\n[noise] uh but we just had radios if we thought something happening I saw in mid stabbing each other\nAnd so we would call on the radio and then there was a team of tactical team they would come with pepper spray\nBut they would almost always get there after the the incident was over a but again it with another liability issue because um you know guards who in who do have coverage spray of abuse it some time and it can lead to lawsuits are soldiers easier for the company to just not give it to us\nOkay so you get there you are able to successfully blend in a despite taking notes seriously and people kind of wondering what's he doing the ... you didn't get exposed\nUm so you get a month of training a lot of which entails nothing more than just sitting there until about a time clock runs out they tell you your job is to not get hurt at nine dollars an hour they're not paying enough\nTo get in the middle of a fight between inmates and that the most important thing is the shareholders so in that case we're talking about cc a Corrections Corporation of America which is this mega corporation what did you know about them going in\nA CCAs a one point four billion dollar your corporation or the industry the entire private prison industry is a four billion dollars a year um\nI knew that they started in the Nineteen eighties at a time when the prison population or was it was just booming in America in states were not able to build prison fast enough uh the\nThis company essentially proposed\nTo states that it would build prisons on their own and run them cheaper\nI'm In many states accepted a so essentially the model or that they came up with was one in which a states would pay the company a PR DM so they pay every day I was a price the prisoners that they would pay thirty four dollars a day\nPer inmate and the company would also be traded on New York stock exchange so it'd be bringing in a in combat way\n... and they refer to the inmates as customers is that right [laughter] is that that I read that they can\nSave at one point in training which I never quite understood because they're not exactly paying are paying the company or the inmates really are the commodities themselves\nExactly which is why it's so it's just so cynical to even call them customers but you said that the company ca gets about thirty four dollars a day or did at that time per prisoner per day and that compares\nTo what it was costing states not to publicly run these facilities it was costing instead of thirty four it was costing fifty two but the ... was that they had to sign a contract\nGet almost guaranteeing full occupancy now that to me sounds a again like a just a recipe for um a circumstances where cops are required to make more arrests judges are required to find more people guilty\nTo guarantee is satisfied so to what extent did you see the whole privatization of this process as being part of the problem\n[noise] you know I don't know I wouldn't say that the ah that the prison privatization is necessarily pushing people into prison I think that ah it's more a symptom of a the rate at which were incarcerating people\nUm I think the causes of mass incarceration are very complex or they have to do with um you know the length of sentences were giving people which has increased over time uh criminalization of of non violent offenses mandatory minimums\nAre policing you know racism in American society economic inequality I mean this is a massive problem and the fact that we're putting so many people in prison over two million people in prison at at a given time uh leads to this problem where there is this is a hugely expensive endeavor\nAnd ah so there's I never really be going to be state states we're going to be looking for ways to save money which is where the private prison industry comes in\nAnd also when we're imprisoning this many people there is no way to do it in any way does humane or they need to rehabilitation because ah it costs a lot of money\nWell certainly there are those who would argue that perhaps\nBy the private approach to this is more businesslike or the delivery of services to the customers is likely to be better but okay you get there I don't know what's your expectation is that\nThey give you your uniform they give you a month's training and you're out in the general population but in some cases what we were finding work things like excrement\nAnd uh open wounds you not being treated and talk a bit about the conditions once you were actually on the inside a and one of the guards what were the things that you found that kind of shocked you the most\nAh one of my first days inside the prison uh actually my very first day when I was still in training or I met a man or who's in a wheelchair who had no legs and fingers or he'd lost them to gain green a he\nHad been begging for months or to go to the hospital because he was in severe pain and he would go to the infirmary and they would just send him back with ... and uh and\nHe eventually you know had had gangrene had his legs and potatoes and I met a man who uh who is in my unit when I was working who kept collapsing from chest pains literally collapsing on to the floor and they also would not send them out to the hospital\nAnd what I learned is that when I looked at the company's contracts or\nThe contract requires that if the companies send somebody out to the hospital they have to pay the bill the company has to pay\nSo it was very reluctant to send people out so you would see these kind of severe a medical issues of just kind of ignored\nUm I also\nAh saw a lot of violence I mean this was a the most violent prison in the state of Louisiana um and you know keep in mind that Louisiana prisons in general are are not uh they're they're not known for their good conditions you know uh whether public or private ah but this prison [noise]\nYou know there are Fifteen hundred inmates there were\nRoughly twenty five guards are on shift for a day they're making nine dollars an hour a day of ... there have no motivation to do anything except clock clock out twenty five guards with how many ... Fifteen hundred ...\nUm and they're ... during the four months that I was there there were about two hundred weapons are found in the prison which is um I think it was twenty three times more than Angola Prison the maximum security prison in Louisiana [noise] um and they're\nYears meaning rehabilitative programs a vocational programs uh which ... led to a very frustrated a population of inmates who wanted something to do with their lives while they're locked up um ... many people did want to better themselves a which also you know it feeds this kind of cycle of violence\nUm I one day sat on my ... my first official day on the job I sat on a suicide watch which I'm a kind of gave me a sense of the mental health options that prisoners have there in the whole prison a Fifteen hundred mates there was one part time psychiatrist in one full time social worker [noise]\nUm so the prisoners having severe having mental health issue was having a breakdown often there's nobody there to to see him\nAnd uh so the only option he has has to be on suicide watch if he says he is suicidal the prison has put him on suicide watch which is solitary confinement\nOr he will have no clothing you only have a a tear proof blanket no mattress no books nothing in the cell\nAnd he sits there are in a guard sits and watches him for twenty four hours a day so I sat for twelve hours and watch the prisoner\nUm who are his name was Damian costly he uh had threatened he didn't want me sitting there and watching him you know he didn't wanna guard sitting in front of him the whole time he threatened if I didn't leave he would break his neck which are reported a psychiatrist came some six hours later\nA and and by the way the the people on suicide watch are fed a worst food than the other prisoners they get a a little lunch bag that the core value of which is below USDA standards\nA month later after I left the prison I was contacted by Damien mother or who told me that he means committed suicide he'd been on a suicide watch many times um I later she let me look through his files which showed that he had been on a hunger strike many times demanding that accompany provide\nReal mental health services and they didn't and he committed suicide when he died he waits Seventy one pounds\nUm he hanged himself and was in a coma and sent to the hospital in a coma\nAnd I later did a a records request with the state of Louisiana asking them how many people committed suicide in that prison that year and they said zero\nNow the company says that it's rate of suicide is lower than it is in public prisons and what happened to ... case is they are the warden granted him a compassionate release when he was in a coma released from the prison so when he died he was technically not in the custody of the company so the Kevin ...\nThanks Marilyn enough yeah thank you um I remember\nThere was a lawsuit because some companies were charging an exorbitant amount for inmates to reach out so it's punitive it's designed\nTo be and you talked a little bit a racially about the inmate profile but fully a third of these inmates one out of three have mental health problems um one out of ten has severe health problems you talked about\nThe inmate who uh offensively because of diabetes which might have been treatable had lost limbs and and fingers and about twenty five percent about a quarter\nHave I cues of less than Seventy mhm so what does that say to you about how a for profit or maybe even um public\nUh institutions are corral ling a particular demographic of people they are black and brown they tend to have health issues and they tend to have low IQ's does that tell you that there isn't a deliberate nature to this\nWell I think that it uh this is actually represent ... representative of the prison population in general or the companies themselves do choose who comes there the the judges and a ... or the the part of the corrections decides where prisoners going to go um\nThere there are certain ways in some states where the company has some choice in California for example or the company has worked into his contract that it will not accept prisoners with severe a medical conditions because it costs a lot of money\nAnd this goes into the the question of how much of these companies actually save because uh you know if if\nPrivate prison companies are not taking these high costs inmates they're going that cause of going back onto the taxpayers so there's all these kinds of invisible\nUh costs also a counties when they are vying for contracts to build prisons will often offer us many subsidies uh to these companies that's another hidden costs by by taxpayers\nUm but to touch on the phone a issue this also a touches on the recent a prison a strike that happened there was a net nationwide or strike inside prisons across the country\nAnd one of their uh complaints when if their demands I should say was a an end immediate into prison slavery and what they meant by that was the labor or that prisoners do which is either unpaid or is paid at cents on the dollar Fifteen twenty five cents per dollar\nNow this labor is it's not like the the labor you know fifty years ago when all prisoners were forced to labor generally know prisoners are ...\nWill say this is voluntary they're not required to do this\nBut when you are a prisoner especially if you're somebody who's been in for a long time and you have a you don't have anyone outside putting money in your commissary a you often need to buy 'em food or if the you know the the food in the prison is is bad\nOr some prisons people have to buy just basic things like soap and toothbrushes um\nYou are going and you want to make phone calls you know you want to talk to people on the outside and these phone calls a phone call rates are exorbitant you were going to be compelled to work a job for Fifteen cents an hour or so the question of how voluntary this is a you know it's it's a it's not clear\nWe're talking to Shane Bauer eight six six seven eight eight to five five is the number and let's go to Albert in San Francisco Hi thanks for being there Albert\nHow are you can you hear me yes go right ahead\nI I'm not as part of my graduate thesis I studied the private prisons in California specifically and I just wanted to uh expound upon some things that you had said not and this is specific to California um the private prisons are their cash house\nHere at least they were getting paid on both sides so not only is the state of California paying\nYou know corruption corporations are American geo court hurt me out to them but they're also contracting out the labor to private companies so they're getting a revenue stream a on both sides\nIn California as well or what they did the private prisons they actually made these videos propaganda videos which they would play and the government\nState prisons I'm In which inmates could apply to be transferred to the private prisons in which they're interviewing inmates at these private prisons who say how great it is there how much better it is they're they get paid a little bit more uh for their work and the other thing I wanted to touch on is\nThe executive is for these private prisons are constantly lobbying for proper penalty\nMore uh well I was uh on the books because they need a these inmates to come into their presence in order to maintain their business now consider this\nRemove a father and husband from a family and incarcerate him\nNice nice lobbyist for these companies love that because it's it disrupts the family dynamic and now the son\nOf that inmate or the daughter is more likely\nTo be to be an offender just as their ah their father\nWas like what the makings for great thesis Albert it's quite Machiavellian if we\nLock up the father take him away from the children that means we may be able to count on another generation for for revenue that's a remarkable insight thanks for calling Albert did you have any thoughts on that\nWell this made me think of the uh I mean one of the main areas of the companies these companies are lobbying right now is actually an immigrant detention um they have been lobbying for for tougher\nUh laws around a around immigration and they also happen to be a that this happens to be of the kind of growth area for these companies are\nThe private prison industry controls about two thirds of uh immigrant detainees in this country right now um\nUh and they are the Obama administration towards the end of his his administration granted to see a one billion dollar no big contract for a family detention center\nIn Texas so and and also um towards the towards the end of the Obama administration um he actually uh announced that uh\nThe federal government was not going to use private prisons anymore right so when this happens ah their stock price tanked fell by half a day that Donald Trump was elected it rose higher than any company in the company and the stock market\nA likely because investors were expecting that he ... to be tougher on immigration\nUm and now you know the the stock prices you know it's doing better than it did before ... station and a Jeff Sessions right after Trump was negotiated rolled back the Obama era decision to stop using private prison companies\nIt takes to ordinary next to go out there in San Francisco Hi Albert thanks related\nI thank you very much for taking my call good morning morning or I after listening to your show I'm I'm just wondering what today's speaker would have to say about things that any of us can do that can be effective\nA at a resting and reversing the conditions that we've been hearing about your um\nUh if you have anything to say about that I Am also one comment to make and that's that I work in a um volunteer literacy program teaching kids to read and an alarming statistic that we learned at the outset was that\nSeventy five percent of the kids who do not read adequately by grade three a wind up in ah the prisoner the corrective system\nOkay thank you so first question was what can be done to stem a especially given how opaque things are in these institutions what can average folks do and secondly what about that school to prison pipeline [noise]\nUh well I'm a journalist I'm not an activist so my focuses is writing on these things but I Do know that in the bay area there are a resources for people who want to do that kind of work a prison activists resource center is a place where that sends people to to various organizations are\nDepending on what they're interested in doing [noise] um\n[noise] and what was the second question\nWell the school to prison pipeline and what can people do is they are interested in this issue\nYeah I mean school prison pipeline is a is a very complex issue or I there are people in the prison that I was in who had been were in their thirties and forties who'd been in the system since they were teenagers you know just a it's a common problem\nUh throughout the country um but I Would again just point people to to looking into these these organizations", "show_name":
