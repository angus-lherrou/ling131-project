are also ongoing discussions to allow exposure to higher levels of radiation other toxins and to ignore research collected in studies that include anonymous participants which is standard scientific practice\nWill joining us to talk about the report and how scientists should respond and how they are responding is ... ... as a historian of science and author of the forthcoming book freedoms laboratory\nThe Cold War struggle for the soul of science\nIt's about how the American idea of science being removed from politics originally was a propaganda tool\nDeveloped to counter communist science but she argues that science is in fact political by nature and scientists need to get off the fence and change the way they talk about their work\nAdorable has taught classes on science medicine and the media at the University of Pennsylvania and she joined us on the line from Philadelphia Hi Audrey welcome to the show\nTo morning thanks for having me well it's great to have you you know I have to say I always\nStruggle with these shows that we do know about climate change a given who's in the White House and the reality is that we're facing with climate deniers really making the\nDecisions and I wonder as a historian of science\nHow the I mean how do you kind of explain where we are right now there's so many things happening right in front of our eyes we don't even need a report to tell us that we need to act now and yet with these people in the White House they're just taking us backwards [noise] right\nI think I think you're very right to be concerned and when we look at all of the changes that have happened with the Trump Administration um some of the biggest have had to do with his attitude towards science so it's not just that there are active a climate change deniers in the White House but regular scientists have largely been sidelined from an ...\nOr so for instance there at the White House has an office of science and Technology Policy and the head of that office has traditionally been the president's science advisor\nThat they had to that office has been empty since the inauguration since January twenty Seventeen it's the longest time that there hasn't been someone in a presidential science advisory position since the position was created in the Eisenhower administration um so there's a real vacuum of science advise\nI'm In an aside from the vacuum the other thing that's that's quite different that is it a fairly a dramatic sea change\nUm is dropping the pretense that defines advice that the administration's would be getting a wouldn't be affected by politics that that that they what they would desire would be nonpartisan um advice\nActivities that we've seen have either you know push people out um directly or you know discourage them from continuing to to serve in government positions and so I think it's going to be\nFelt um you know felt for a long time and will need to figure out ways to create that pipeline again so that uh it becomes a really sexy and really interesting to enter a government service and once we have in an oven a straight from the philosopher hostile to ah to the work of federal government scientists\n... what would you say about the significance of so many scientists environmental protection specialist and engineers leaving the EPA\nWell it's not just the the loss of the specific expertise part of what's happening is a broader transition that is uh in in in some ways even more nefarious in which actually being associated with the EPA is in some ways being seen as a conflict of interest\nSo it's not simply the employees who are leading but uh one of the changes that happened with the EPA signs and ... over the past year or so\nUm is it that Scott Pruitt I'm sad that that people who had received grants from researchers who had received grants from the EPA in the past\nCould no longer sort of on the EPA science advisory boards because it would constitute a conflict of interest\nSo I'm of course these are many of the researchers who are out researching um environmental contaminants or toxicology those are exactly the people who would have the knowledge that you want\nA vote because they had received funds from the EPA was considered a conflict of interest meanwhile I'm do people who had been involved in lawsuits against the EPA 'em down was not considered a conflict of interest\nUm so part of what's happened is that we have these advisory boards that now are often packed with people who actively have opposed\nUm knowledge or being actively excluded from it so it's not just that uh the scientist or discouraged from seeing him into their positions and they're feeling that the that the positions around rewarding there are some other ways in which I'm active scientist with knowledge about the matter is at hand or being actively excluded from participating in the process\nMichael you have worked with ... scientists under three different administrations are you still in touch with people who work at the EPA and what are you hearing from them\nUm we're hearing that there are determined to continue to do their jobs and less third told otherwise I don't know these are people who will keep their nose down and do the best they can and communicate out their sciences are able to [noise]\nUm and we're also working with a lot of ex UPA scientists either people who have left the agency or have retired um to a book get information\nOut of the agency about bad things that are happening I'm as well as I'm hoping to explain you know publicly why these types of scientific positions matter um and I think there's you know the people who are there over the long term that we've been talking about\nFor the U. P. A. and other agencies also have these incredible fellowship the give scientists\nReal world policy experience and give them a foot hold that to enter\nA public service um those those fellowships have been largely shut down um and so you\nUm you know you're stopping the next generation from really developing the skills necessary to informed public health and environmental protections I'm In the future um and so you know all of the different um actions that we've seen taken together I'm really have\nSidelined science from from these agencies and weaken them but we do find that the people inside still are dedicated to doing their jobs and doing their work and spending you know spending time documenting what's what's happening I'm\nAnother challenge that we had last year at least under Scott Pruitt was that a lot of scientists are being discouraged even from taking notes in meetings um so as not to create any kind of record that that could be used to prove that these um actions are being taken in a non scientific way and so\nWe worked with other organizations to develop um you know guidance for scientists and how they what rights they have to take notes both personal notes in professional notes\nSo that they're able to do their work and they're able to document what's actually happening within the agency\nAudrey are you in touch with anyone who still works at the EPA\nAre those are quite my networks I knew a lot of people who worked in federal agencies fifty years ago a contemporary agencies are not too much but I'm extremely grateful for the work that I'm that Michael and his colleagues have been doing it UCS you'd asked earlier about weeds that um\nThe numbers of the public can find out about what's going on some of the resources that the union of Concerned Scientists have been putting together a really one of the best places for members of the public who wants to follow these issues I highly recommend it to work that they're doing ...\nAudrey Wolff is a historian of science and author of the forthcoming book freedoms laboratory the Cold War struggle for the soul of science\nThe book is about how the American idea of science being removed from politics originally was a propaganda tool develop to counter communist science but ... argues that science is in fact political by nature and scientists need to get off the fence and change the way they talk about their work\nAudrey Wolff has taught classes on science medicine and the medium at the University of Pennsylvania we're also joined today by Michael helper and deputy director at the center for science and democracy at the union of Concerned Scientists\nMichael defend scientist from harassment he help scientists more effectively engaged\nBy scientific information and if you have any questions for our guest we'd love to hear from you if you're a scientist how are you making sense of what we're dealing with right now how does politics affect your job\nUm what are your thoughts about the new PCC report that says we only have about twelve years to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nAnd then if you're just completely overwhelmed and\nWell depressed can come into the sentence depressed about what's happening right now with the environment and the climate deniers and the White House\nAnd who is really making the decisions you can give us a call if you have any questions about where we are and what is most effective what you can do eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W.\nDot O. R. G. [noise] well let's talk about the PCC report that was released just last week it's getting a lot of print attention I Wish it got more attention on the cable shows\nUm they are just focused on Trump Trump Trump but this deserves so much more attention Michael what are your thoughts on this I mean the overall message is the report says we have about twelve years to avoid a catastrophic environmental break down what were your take away from the report\nOr for the report it so you know underscores the fact of the bigger global warming of the\nGreater the risk for them back for a society will be so it really underscores the urgency of wrapping up a climate action at this point I'm I'm you know the\nUh we get a lot of attention towards a what's happening within the White House and the federal level and the lack of leadership that we see on on climate change that's pretty profound but I'm\nA ... is a lot of happening of the state and local level um the where ... states like California are really stepping up to fill the void onto because they're the ones that are dealing with the impacts of of more drugs of storms that are worse and I know a fire preserved petition\nAnd other challenges and so um you know limiting warming to either one point five or two degrees Celsius is going to require not\nJust you know small changes but really transformational changes but um you know change we use energy or we grow and consume food um and we we have a lot of these technologies and and now you know we can we have the tools\nThat we need to solve of we just need the political will to move forward ...\nWhat would you add Audra\nYeah I think I think I Would underscore the idea that these are political decisions to be made and ... one of the things that made this most recent report so much different than the prior reports\nUh was the way that it embrace urgency and we did it in ... embracing emotional response to urgency I think some of the prior IPC reports um have really a kind of tamp down on that they were they were concerned that if it seems to emotional too urgent to upset\nA that it might come off as seeming like a political document instead of a scientific document\nAnd I think by now everyone has realized you know it it it it's too late for now the time window in which we can address these changes is very very small\nUm it requires action now and so the current report very much feels like I'm a document you know they did is basically saying we need to to address this problem right now and it's not that scientists are necessarily the people who should be making decisions in democracies right that would be a technology\nUm but we have all of these decisions political just said you know political decision\nThey're about regulating radiation um they require scientific knowledge and so that's that's the vacuum that's where we're not uh the the policymakers just aren't accessing that advice right now on the federal level I'm as Michael mentioned at the state level and the city level there's many smaller initiatives\nOut one of the sudden so the the wording of this proposed transparency rule uh basically suggested that regulators can only use studies up for which the researchers have provided all underlined data sort of raw data\nAnd one of ... there are a couple of concerns about that one is about proprietary data one is about a personal information for instance personal health information for people who have been affected by various issues\nI'm In and there's a separate issue about older studies where the data don't necessarily a exist anymore but you go to the one with the personal health information there is a study called a ... study I'm just a it's an extremely important longitudinal study that talks about um\nYou know the long term effects of many of the ah pollutants that you've just mentioned whether it's about ... you know ozone or whether it's about certain particulates\nI'm In that particular study promised its participants confidentiality\nSo the way that um the way that the transparency rule is originally worded you would have to reject every patients information would be an extremely time consuming operation it could happen eventually but it is another way of kind of throwing gum and to the work and slowing down the regulatory process so that it becomes\nThe agencies to access the information about health or about safety I'm On a timely basis to protect the public health\nAnd Michael were going to get to calls in just a minute but one more question on pollution the Washington Post recently reported that the EPA dismissed dozens of outside scientists who were charged with advising the agency on how to set air pollution standards\nInstead the EPA has decided to let a seven member group called the clean air scientific advisory committee alone perform these assessments\nCan you talk about what this change means and why this is so important\nSure yeah I didn't mean to me in that um the the big three on smog and for the the the I just won't have access to independent scientific information out of it moves forward to make decisions\nAround health and safety and they're widely expected to try their best to work for process as efficiently as possible to try to weaken\nThe air pollution standards by the end of twenty twenty or the science would clearly getting the way we've seen in previous administrations in the George W. Bush administration the\nScientists who were advised in the UP I strongly criticized the decision what it was not grounded and the best available science and when it was not fired typically credible um the the the decision this time around is just to get rid of the fire to some early so they're not in a position to to create that criticism\nOf what may end up being a nod of Science Faith and then\nUm you know these have significant impact from a public health um and a decision not to move forward with a more productive standard um men if more people will get sick and the more people will die\n... Michael ... is deputy director of the center for science and democracy at the union of Concerned Scientists adorable if as a historian of science and author of the forthcoming book freedoms laboratory the Cold War struggle for the soul of science this is your calls one planet series\nAnd today we arm really giving you an overview of what's happening\nAt under the Trump Administration and the scientists that are leaving the EPA the scientists that are being let go at a time when\nWe need to take just major major action on climate change the un came out with a report that says we have about twelve years to avoid a catastrophic environmental break down some scientists say that report doesn't go far enough including Michael man who's been on the show many times\nAnd let's hear from our listeners let's go to Larry in Berkeley Hi Larry welcome to the show\nAll right thank you I'm Laura I'm In Berkeley you know all I Would like to keep more money ... spend almost all going to a few friends but if I'm going to survive\nOr be part of really a greater reality all hall bald or B ... grabs a little bit of knowledge that you are giving it is intelligently as possible hold you all helped me in 'bout challenge\nTo an environmental organization yeah Audra what are your thoughts on that\nI Would say go local uh one of the most effective ways so so when we think about how to fight climate change there are these large scale federal actions\nUm and of course there are ... actions that individuals can take the sort of on the middle level we think about how to fight climate change we're really talking about is fighting the expansion of the fossil fuel industry\nUm and so there are any number of grassroots environmental justice organizations um throughout the throughout the country these organizations can really make good use of your phone so whether it's a fighting a pipeline or whether it's finding a new um you know gas fire\nThere are existing groups that are doing this sickening absolutely benefit from dollars in time and Michael what would you add\nYeah I mean I Would add to that the people who are hurt the most by these policy by the lack of action at the federal level or by the ... and the destruction of the environmental justice off over the PA or other problems that we've seen are people of color and low income communities\nUm they tend to bear more of the burden of um environmental contaminants I'm and I'm a relatively less power than\nI'm In uh some other uh people who don't have that much exposure to those kinds of contaminants so [noise] um I agree with going local and looking at um you know funding those organizations that are fighting to I'm a eliminate those kinds of health disparities that we have to enforce the too much\nI'm Glad you brought that up because NPR had a piece about the hurricane in Florida\nAnd which has really hit poor communities so hard and people were interviewed saying you know people we work with and and service are living paycheck to paycheck and they cannot leave this area they have nowhere to go I mean we're hearing this more and more Michael\nAcross the country and ... obviously ... around the around the globe\nYeah I agree and you know evacuate in cost money and you can't do it every time you can sometimes can't even do it once in a ... times people um get criticized for for not leaving and and um you know all of that takes pick the resources and it it is generally\nUm you know the people with fewer resources that are going to be the most impacted by\nUm are are trained in climate and the public health and environmental consequences of that um and you're right not only just here at home but all the way around the world and that has impact on those in individual and also creates a lot of instability in terms of our men are global political environment\n[noise] well ... I Hope that helps in there and really incredible local organizations doing great work and you're in Berkeley in Richmond um indigenous led organizations so I Hope that helps thank you for calling let's go next to ... in San Francisco Hi Rodney\nHi guys I'm as was waiting for the phone call the recycling trucks lock my car um and they were doing their job you do what I wanted to us everybody I'm about this I heard a statistic the other day that in the U.S we recycled nine percent of our plastics and that in Europe you refer\nA recycle about thirty five percent I thought they were both quite low but I was shocked to hear that about the U.S\nAnd my question is what responsibility do the producers of these consumer goods we think that's a fraud\nAt everything that's packaged my background is food industry and I've seen how that has progress into\nSo many products and so many packaged products that comment about going to come in a box et cetera what like when you have a society designed around consumerism\nI always look at words does\nAll that garbage goes where this old up plastic go how does that how does it end in the seat like what is what what is something like ... it seems like what I can do it very small even though I have a very environmentally conscious family and extended family yeah\nWell thank you Ron me I [laughter] I was sitting here shaking my head because we've done shows about plastic for ... over a decade on the show we did one show actually calling out the companies that produce all of the plastic because you're right in many ways the onus is on the individual and yes we should be responsible but\nYou know package of this stuff and are pushing plastic and when we have for example a plastic bag you know propositions on the ballot they spend millions of dollars to overturn it you know what about the responsibility of the corporations that are causing these problems well\nThey they have an enormous responsibility to do something about that but in some ways even focusing on consumer goods misses this broader point about the broader relationship between Groat economies and all the carbon economy\nUm so yeah ... ... plastic production and even the energy that goes into recycling takes a lot of energy but some things like a mining bitcoins\nWere um the is keeping backup servers so that you can run searches on Google all the time or that you can keep all of your photos in the cloud", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "15"}
