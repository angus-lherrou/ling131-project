happening in the United states\nEm Ali Ali we've had you on many times to talk about what's happening on the ground in Kabul and Afghanistan and I'm sure a lot of people don't know that more than ten thousand civilians were killed last year and that number is expected to be even higher this year first off why are these numbers so high\nThe number is so high because I mean it's ten thousand killed and injured or but the numbers are so high for a number of for a variety of\nReasons one is that the a group including the told the bond Indonesia are increasingly targeting urban Center for the call bill and the city on a blog\nI'm also you know we have to remember that there are also civilians are caused by a airstrikes both foreign and have on 'em and live in the war just intensify in the sense that these opposition groups really want to show their powers by\nTargeting the uh you know very ah populated urban centers um and that's really what we didn't want high civilian casualty toll and ... what would you add\nA yeah and on top of that there's been a an escalation of the costs of from the American side I'm kind of last year and a half the intensity and the pace of airstrikes it's has increased greatly\nA particularly in rural areas like held in a car and most of this is a reported um and there's incidents that I hear about from from friends and those areas of\nAirstrikes killed or injured or the people that are tend not to make it into the into the media\nCan you elaborate on that ... I mean we you know the a P reports that the Afghan war is costing taxpayers ... billion dollars a year what exactly is the American presence in Afghanistan like today\nAre there are having some troops on the ground I'm including forces and including troops are that are partnered with the Afghan forces in army\nNow the houses in Dubai and keep a you know have bank accounts with millions and millions of dollars um while their fellow countrymen are starving or have you know basic services and ... and it I think it it\nIt also was something that I'm not into the conflict because you have this sense that there's a small group of people who\nPush themselves extraordinary are Americans and off guard or the way who can reach spirituals extraordinarily at the expense of the majority of often and certainly the message that the Taliban and it can commuters work strong certainly I'm a sort of\nTry to promote saying that they are the ones who are protecting against the sort of been out to sort of corruption\nAnd ... and non can you tell us who's making these decisions when it comes to doling out this money I mean what what's what's what are the biggest difference is between how that worked under Obama and how it's working under Trump\nI mean there really aren't that many different obviously a you know there's a question of scale um you know sometimes different mystery of the ruptured up the amount of money or or brought it back down but the very dynamic this fundamental logic of how money is spent has been mostly the same between\nBush or Obama and Trump which is that most of the money is spent on military not on on the Mediterranean approach most of the money is spent in sort of tested the sub contracting so you know you want to go build a road somewhere not got us out you don't give that money directly to walk on the road you subcontracted to\nAmerican corporations usually who them for contracted out and so on and on the train until eventually it gets to some small company I've gone to stall and there's no oversight or what they do with that money that that model of spending money has been basically in place since two thousand and one and it's been really no change from and you're from India nutritional them\nWell if you'd like to join us if you have any questions or comments about Afghanistan it has been Seventeen years since the United states invaded that country\nJust last year more than ten thousand Afghan civilians were either killed or injured not number is expected to be even higher this year\nThe a P recently had a fairly short piece about how the Afghan war is costing the United states taxpayers forty five billion a year and ... says most of that money is spent on military military contractors\nYou can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G. and non go Paul is author of no good men among the living America the Taliban and the war through Afghan eyes\n... as a freelance journalist based in Kabul\nAccording to brown university's cost of war project a hundred and four thousand people have been killed in Afghanistan since two thousand one thirty one thousand have been civilians an additional forty one thousand civilians have been injured since two thousand and one\nI only do those numbers sound about right to you and what the research you've done\n[noise] um no those are the problem with those numbers is that they need to be ... uh one of the problems in and I think a non ...\nAnd you know the government everyday pose a updates in like something to be killed with many more McKinsey company and he would get the ...\nUm and the truth is because of the areas there and uh because of one make it very difficult to actually affect the whole situation\nAnd find out who was killed 'em so in terms of civilian casualties that number and you know at the government always an ISIS been quiet\nAbout civilian casualties there were several airstrikes in the north and east of the country or in the last month or so that the un documented a and did as a result of civilian casualties\nAnd those who never get dry I'm for this this is a major issue where we're constantly be told you know they just need\nA total of bonded by age or a militant overkill but there's really no way to prove that and when you go to many provinces as I've been you know they say the the issue is for instance like if I if I if I Want to be with people\nYou know who the government might commit any ah my my uh white ... enemy button\nAnd you know I got many kill kill kill them that in fact it would likely accountant isn't in combating too um so so this is precisely the issues that we don't have the numbers and we're just constantly being told X number five years or whatever\nAnd and and on human rights watch found as Ali just said that the Afghan government has no capacity to investigate civilian casualties and according to reports U.S forces downsize civilian casualties so so what would you add I mean how how do we know what the real numbers are\n... yeah I mean I agree that that um it's very hard to say what the numbers are are you know I've done studies on civilian casualty estimates and other countries and even in places that are much more developed a it's ... it's very hard to do and not going to start where large parts of the countryside\nOr for the reasons you mentioned there are really under developed or or impoverished it's very hard to get their um the Taliban are not friendly to journalists they're not friendly to independent research or your government certainly isn't a\nFriendly either to to those or it could use it makes it very difficult I mean whether it's a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand I don't know\nI don't think anybody really knows what will be re can say is that a large number of people\nHad been killed and injured and it's probably far greater than most Americans couldn't even begin to realize\nWhat about drone strikes over the years have been ... good coverage of drone strikes human rights watch between November twenty Seventeen in April of this year interviews forty two civilian air strength victims and witnesses\nAnd ... what can you tell us about drone strikes how often do they happen and who's carrying them out\nWell in a drone strikes happen um but I think what's important to point out is a a lot of the bombings just old fashioned spirit you know a piloted aircraft and you know we're used to be drunk sites are drones hum of making up the majority of the strikes as places like Pakistan to where\nThe U.S legally not able to fly I'm\nSort of ... manned aircraft but under its it's in some respects very old fashioned into central they're just using there's all sorts of things that we are with pilots and from the point of view\nOf those who are on the receiving end uh of course it doesn't really make a difference or whether they're a remotely controlled or\nPilot at the point is either way there's a lot of airstrikes\nAnd a lot of civilian casualties but anyway the drone strikes mostly would be carried out by the United states\nAli what would you add\nHave a I was talking about because I have one and a lot of the opposite to drone strikes\nAnd this is exactly the same thing about earlier where I Would go to them that I can get the government offices like schools um civil society activists journalists the media and and they don't say no because there's very little follow through and and when you have to try and report on\nAli I'm ... I'm Sorry we're having we're having a hard time again with your connection out will try to get a clear connection were connecting with ... a freelance journalist based in Kabul, Afghanistan\nUm we think it's really important to talk to a journalist who's actually in Afghanistan but sometimes that means that we have a line that's unpredictable so hopefully we'll try to get a better line for Ali\nI'm a non ... let's talk about what it means to be a journalist in Afghanistan and hopefully we can reconnect with Ali was a better number Thirteen journalists have been killed in Afghanistan\nAnd just this year so what is it like for you when you report in Afghanistan are you able to move freely or or what is that like\nA lot for your able to move freely but a quarter from what was the most\nDangerous countries in the world to be a journalist but less so for me as an American workers it's much more dangerous for all the ... the majority of those who've been killed or wounded were off guard um that's that's where the real dangers and I think it's in part because often journalists do have a structural\nProductions or the or a foreign correspondent\nMight hug 'em you know it's interesting 'cause ... you know it was a low security protocols in place sometimes\nThose particles your for your local rush or if you're a Florida\nI'm In many cases the insurgents are less likely to kill a foreign journalist because they see them as a source of the ...\nAh where us rubbish we can see that for a local journalists were all these are the locals are or ... or ... or a ... and ... are you back with us\nYes okay hopefully we have a better line sorry about that Ali and we were just talking about the difficulty and they'll danger involved and being a journalist on the ground in Afghanistan what has your experience been like\nUm so the difficulties come in several forms I go on the one hand you do have an increase in the ... and the so called his forces are targeting journalists\nYour readers believe they've geostrategic interests in certain parts of the world particularly Louis [noise] or her\nResources oil for a licking places for ... for a lot of reasons\nBut what's you know that's always been the case I think what's unique about this sort of post nine eleven or a is a no war the war is the role of a state of being in peace is the exception and so you know this is just accepted by by everybody that we're just going to be at war and\nThe military spending is higher than at any time than the height of the Iraq War adjusted for inflation and thank you for that call every on and we will ... will do a show about that\nBecause we talk about military spending pretty regularly on this show a non politician award winning freelance journalist and author of no good men among the living in America the Taliban\nAnd divorced for Afghan eyes Anon thank you for your work and thank you so much for joining us up to Charlotte thank you and fortunately we did lose ... but I Want to think Ali he does put his life on the line to\nGive people on the ground a voice and to report for various outlets in this country so I Hope you can check out his work and hopefully we can connect with him in the future ... is a freelance journalist based in Kabul unfortunately we lost his connection\nWell now we are going to switch gears and talk about the latest on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate and joining us now is will bunch an award winning journalist national columnist for the Philadelphia daily news and author of the political blog attitude\n[noise] oh okay\nSorry we just lost well bunch I'm Wondering if we got any breaking news just in the last forty minutes the here's what's happening\nThis morning Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski voted against sending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate and a number of reporters say that if she voted no this morning that probably means she's going to vote no again\nSenator Jeff flake just announced about half hour ago that unless something big happens he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh and we're expecting an announcement from Susan Collins at noon Pacific and joining us now is will bunch Hi welcome to the show\nHigh tax revenue back great to have you did anything breaking the last forty minutes that we need to know about not\nThat I'm aware of up in a modern from the from both we both the ... are the two biggest development so far which would be a\nNo vote from Lisa Murkowski which apparently a this is very interested in Berlin was kind of spontaneous I mean she but she really was undecided are waving until she actually got onto the Senate for this morning in a vote of no no I'm On the road but also will will will know to\nMeans that uh two of the other three way Rene votes which are\nAlso have to vote no or or is he mentioned the looks pretty much like Jeff Flake from Arizona who's one of those three is\nIs a yes vote a and so I I think really\nAre I think everyone agrees at this point that probably whatever season Collins does at three o'clock this afternoon a ah eastern time ah knees or time in the out in the Pacific uh uh is going to uh you know really kind of\nBeat the beside or because I think I think Joe Manchin in such a tough spot that he's going to I think he would like to vote for a cabin on a I think he doesn't want to be the deciding vote those though is Susan Collins a joined so you can support him he wouldn't be deciding vote anyway so\nUh so I think that's I think I think the whole ball game is going to be what happened uh later today the Susan Collins\nHuh [noise] well and you know some I checked it as well you could change the results of ... thousands and thousands of women and men are\nFlocking to Washington DC from across the country including Alaska\nAnd you've had a bad one of the women who talk to you know basically told Jeff Flake do the right thing in the elevator I mean sharing their sexual assault stories that first time on national television can you talk about how that has been coverage I mean ... even as we speak their actress and the Senate and the Capitol\nYeah I mean frankly I mean to be honest I kinda wish there was almost more coverage I mean I thought yesterday afternoon you had this incredibly powerful moment when a protestors who were\nMostly but not exclusively women are flooded the I Believe it was the hearts in an office building one of the one of the main office buildings are in in the Capitol complex\nOr and basically shut it down because there were so many of them they just\nFlooded the entire building and then finally I Believe the police arrested about three hundred of them including a couple of celebrities like Schumer um median actors\nUh so I'm a ... but but I I was surprised that was not more coverage of that because I I I think you're absolutely right I think I think I think people raising their voices protesters I mean I mean let's not forget it I mean this whole thing started with a woman's decision to speak out\nOr you know that a doctor Christine Blasey Ford if it hurts you not side to raise their voices we wouldn't be here at this point uh\nThat but then so many others and and and you know the the the the uh two women or a a Maria Gallagher and a Santa Maria a trailer who spoke out in the elevator just like a I mean you you could see Jeff Flake space\nOr in the in the committee room after that you could tell that encounter at an influence on them and and like you said\nYou know uh I'm pretty sure that Lisa Murkowski dramatic decision today\nWas usually influenced by the fact that you spend a lot of time yesterday meeting with survivors of sexual assault that uh uh apparently she had very long meetings with these people who come from Alaska to tell their stories and she was very moved by them and I think that's probably what influenced or vote in the end so I'm\nA ... that's been a huge part of the story and and I I think you can't be it'd be highlighted enough because\nYou know that's been a bigger issue and and the whole Trump era you know can I make a difference you know if I if I speak out or if I if I protest or if I\nYou know write an op ed or if I Do anything you know they're going to make a difference and you know we're seeing machines specific instances where you in this capital confirmation fight we can look at it and you can say yes absolutely it's making it\nSaid that her father she center text to her father saying you're going to find out about this on national news but don't worry I'm okay\nI think I think both of them you know that they were in this bizarre position where they basically told Senator Jeff flake about their sexual assault before they told their own family members um\nIt's really amazing that you know well we've been doing shows last week we took breaks during the hearings and then yesterday me up in the lines and we heard from a woman after woman I'm One mankind last week sharing their stories for the first time ever so right there it's just\nI'm just gonna ask you how do you think the media are reporting on ... and then being sensitive enough not to play Trump mocking lousy foreign on a loop over and over again\n[noise] um well sensitivity isn't isn't isn't really the media strong point especially when you know when politics takes over a you know I mean I think\nI think I think that tape that you just mentioned the Trump and and also the large crowd behind from sharing a you know when he bought a a sexual assault survivor\nAnd I just thought that was a special low point in American history but um you know I I think\nI think I'm the whole you know I I I Am both a critic of the media and a defender of the media and and I'm a member of them are in an eye on when it comes to the need to but I think I think on the whole the media has been more positive I mean I think\nUh I I think you have to acknowledge that uh the me too movement might not have started the way it did it not been for the work supporters like like\nThe New York times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein story or in in certainly Ronan Farrow and and and more recently working with Jane Eyre forget about her but um [noise]\nUh you know many of these instances have come to light a you know in in the in the cabinet instance a journalist played a key role you know both Washington Post\nJournalist to you know work with Dr play before to get her story out and then and then more recently the uh uh the the the New Yorker a telling the story of of uh the the uh second accuser yell\nSo uh I'm Deborah mirror so I'm a ... I I think I I agree sensitivity is always going to be an issue and and how they handle it does but I think I think on the whole I think the media's that have been a positive and that's a fair for the most part\n[noise] yesterday we saw Orrin Hatch waving off a protesters demanding to speak with him by saying quote growing up I mean a lot of people I feel that so much at stake then if they need to get into an elevator and talked to someone and tell their stories and that's what they need to do\nThe most that's one of the fascinating things about this I mean I mean it cuts both ways because over what I've been reading a lot last couple of days and you've probably seen this as well is\nThat people are saying that conservatives that you know in in the Republican Party and the right wing he's energized by the vehemence with which people on the left are protesting Kavanaugh you know in other words a you know when when when people", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "06"}
