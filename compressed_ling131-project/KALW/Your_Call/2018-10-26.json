University of Wisconsin students to the students peaceful sit in against Dow Chemical in Nineteen sixty seven that turned violent\nThe film does an incredible job of showing the power of resistance protest organizing and direct action\nIt also raises many questions about media coverage of the war back then and then more is today\nWe're joined by Glenn Silber an award winning filmmaker and broadcast journalist who has produced Ninety prime time news magazine stories for various CBS News an ABC News broadcast as well as ten independent documentaries primarily for PBS\nGlenn silver was

in San Francisco and landmark static in Berkeley\nAnd you can find more information about other screenings across the country at your call radio dot org and Glenn silver joins me in Studio Hi Glen welcome to the show how are you driving it's great to have you ... congratulations on the newly restored film it comes out at\nSuch a critical time in this country because it just watching the film they just kept thinking about media coverage of\nAll of these wars that the U.S is involved in today\nWell it's been very different because in Vietnam of course that became the TV or and that was a huge factor of stoking the anti war movement back home\nAnd then you flash forward to Iraq where everyone all of a sudden is imbedded right I was at ABC News or the car into the offer to be imbedded that wasn't the way I Do business and I thought that was bullshit frankly\nWhat happened when he declined the offer\nOh it's a longer story they just put out the they put out a memo twenty twenty where I was working that asking people if they wanted to get what they called special media training and they explained that meant it would be if you would sided to go over there how you might survive if you were captured\nAnd you know I got a call from a senior producer 'cause I was considered at that point I think maybe the most serious producer on twenty twenty there was always trying to do kind of aggressive things I thought I'd want to go\nBut of course I have two kids in college or I'd been down to El Salvador and things like that and\nThe whole thing I was so against the war in Iraq for months and months I was actually making but friends by being so outspoken about it I thought it was bullshit from the beginning part of my\nBe but um\nAnyway so I just didn't want any part of it uh I wound up doing some important work around the investigation and tonight eleven with John Miller ... we were the ones who broke the story where the terrorists have been living in Paterson New Jersey and you know I felt like I Do plenty of good things on the ground back home I didn't have to go over there and be imbedded\n[noise] that that was really big when that came out is that still happening to you know I don't hear about imbedded report\n... to ... to him is so ridiculous to ramp up to the war in Iraq with this whole question of weapons of mass destruction and signaling to everyone over there that there was going to shock and awe in a month or whatever it was\nBuilding was strange and I just thought it was incredible disaster like to see it like a train wreck and so I didn't want to do it\nCalled the most dangerous man in America which I just love that's on Saturday evening and then lastly or another friend of mine ... field who made the film the life and times of Rosie the riveter and other other really great films she's going to be there on Sunday at four pm show I Love being able to have this dialogue with the audience afterwards and it's been\nIncredibly moving just to see people who haven't seen the film and thirty eight years or some young person who has never seen the film that is what we're really trying to figure out how to get the film it's time for us old guys like me to pass the torch\nBut to me this is like I said this is my contribution to the resistance to put this film back out there to look at ... how do you build a Seventy year resistance campaign what does that take when you're up against presidents like Lyndon Baines Johnson\nAnd war mongering presidents like Richard Nixon who don't even care remember when the film is a guy who says after the moratorium one of the few times we do go outside at Madison\nThe guy says we could have two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand people protest then you hear that Nixon was watching a football game ...\nDefinitely the frustration so all these the texture of this whole movement from start to finish you keep seeing the consciousness growing up seeing the resistance growing and it just charging ahead and not backing down\nSo I think the two types of ways of robbing more as we got to get organized got to get him for them to got to get organized and then you have to really decide if you're going to be which side are you are\nYou talking about and Johnson and next and the choices they made I was thinking about an ad in the White House and you have the seminal events happening in the U.S and he goes to play golf at mar a Lago yeah well right well let's talk about that in a minute if you have any questions or comments for Glenn if you saw that with the war at home we'd like to hear from you if you\nAnd I laughed when did you first start doing journalism\nWell at first I spent my first twelve years as an independent filmmaker making films like the word home in El Salvador new set of Vietnam and you know my wife and I made the film on the San Francisco mind troop here which is a fabulous film called troopers says it award winning film because we really was always\nIn a way back then when I was still in my twenties early thirties\nI sort of looked at the my group is not doing what I was trying to do\nThey do it with theater I was trying to do with film which is create a radical culture and tell the truth and use a different form in this case they're very entertaining\nTo to capture people's attention\nAnd we just love that year we had so much fun and uh so there were other films and then I turned out my wife was pregnant the entire year we made troopers so that was kind of the other day to pet it world that I got very lucky I stumbled into the back door of CBS News an ABC for twenty straight years ah doing\nReally great work because what my problems as an independent which every independent will say\nMoney for production and then how do you distribute it and so when I was working for the prime time shows\nProblem solved in every piece I Would do would be at least maybe five six seven eight million people would say it was like the equivalent of having a hit movie at that that was before the Internet blame for twenty four seven cable at least for the first ten years\nSo I've had this incredible varied career that I don't know anyone else has actually gone from being kind of this radical filmmaker brand which I embraced\nThe forget radical doesn't just mean like I was out there extremists it means getting to the root of the problem that's the first definition in the dictionary so I Love that\nYou can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your\nCall at K. A. L. W. dot L. are edgy and we have a comment on Facebook from Steve says I saw the war at home in Nineteen eighty it was powerful and life changing then I think it's so important for people to see it now to get a perspective on taking direct action for social and political change good jobs the\nThank you Steve we also have an email from Tim my brother was sent to Vietnam made it hum okay I'll never quite the same he recommended that I not go and\nWent to a candidate when I was sixteen and registered as a conscientious objector makes thanks to the Quakers who helped me do the paperwork\nMight number with two hundred and fifty three so I never had to go to jail different flies back then everyone except wealthy and ... folks were subject to the draft now due to Reaganomics it's only poor people who have no choice but to a giant ... volunteer army is\nWell he's certainly right I'm a lot of the people who have come from some of the more depressed areas you know they they are the ones who wind up out of necessity\nGoing into the military and it's hard you know the giraffe is more equitable but or the other hand we saw it when you have an unjust war like Vietnam you know when I came to the University of Wisconsin in Nineteen sixty eight as a freshman I didn't know anything about the war I grew up in a little bubble suburb of New Jersey\nAnd the first day after my parents drop me off at the university and they were so impressed with the campus and everything they said well you're gonna have a great education I did starting the next day when someone from the from the Wisconsin draft resistance union slipped\nAway for the under my door my dorm room door come you know to the next storm tomorrow evening and we're gonna have a meeting about the war in Vietnam I never forget this on top of the leaflet it said\nCollege this orientation [laughter]\nAnd when he went over there there was a hundred and fifty people in a room all freshmen most of 'em didn't do much of anything about the war and that began the process that changed my life getting educated about something that is happening ten thousand miles away but that actually does affect me and so over time certainly my freshman\nIt's one of many thousands of people kind of in the in the movement so to speak because I wanted to be participating because this did affect my life and we did feel a moral responsibility for the government was doing\nIt seems like a novel idea these days but it's so important and I was so lucky to go to Madison was not guaranteed which way I Would go with college I Would go to it's almost like what are called chaos theory of where you wind up\nAnd I'm so that was really my education was not so much in the classroom ... it was more in in the movement in the streets coming to terms with there's a line in the film where the Nineteen sixty five president of STDs talks about\nHow STDs when they were one of the leaders even though they were very very small at that time\nYou said we we never tried to talk people end up things we knew we were right we would take an action and force people to confront the situation and that's how you learned enough to make a decision says you're becoming a real grownup\n[laughter] well thank you so much for the email Ken thanks for sharing that story and let's hear from bill who is making a documentary called the boys who said no ... shall\nHello rose thank you for having me on\nHigh bail did you have a lot in our comment\nA I'll just say first hello to land and I personally will see the war at home to the evening and look forward very much just seeing that and also just seeing that question and answer I'm I Am part of a group\nA making a another documentary film titled the boys who said no uh about the draft resist or in the Vietnam Era Glenn mentioned written gold man who will be doing to an eight tomorrow night with Daniel Ellsberg over in Berkeley\nArt director is Judith Arabic uh who co directed and\nCo produced a film about Ellsberg so we have a very close a connection here um our film is not yet a finished\nA and instead of focusing on one particular play we focus on one particular group that arose as the war began a and as the war went on the group uh at first\nA tendency to burn graphics cards which was extremely controversial and\nBitterly opposed by media and politicians but\nThey felt that that was not enough that after the draft card with burnt everything went on a\nHigh as it had before\nDown and get down were honest that break you had a question for Glenn about his film and about media coverage I'm force\nA you know I Apologize you and I communicated briefly about email or by email this morning and\nI don't we have my he let us know when your film is done and then I have you on the shell thank you All right thank you for calling in and let's take another quick call before the break let's go to William and Belvedere Hi William\nYes thank you very much I I think that the gas made a mistake or when he said that um when the big march is the place that they were told that Nixon was watching a football games\nAnd that that was depressing um indeed people written their biographies subsequently say that he was pulling out of his hair\nOff from being upset about the enormous demonstrations so I think for me the lesson is when you want to do something to do it don't but don't be too dependent upon how the authority figures react\nThey of course they're going to say that what you should have no meaning\nBut if something's right to do it then do it\nYou know I wanted to make a comment about that I I mean the public statement was he was watching a football game but you may be right in fact but one of the things that's come out recently we know that Lyndon Johnson was\nBest ugly and really awful and Vietnam\nAnd in Nineteen sixty eight at the time when he was getting ready to announce that he wasn't going to run again there were five hundred and eighty five thousand troops\nIn Vietnam five hundred and eighty five thousand troops and then we learned two weeks ago from the great historian Michael Beschloss something we never knew before the Westmoreland not only wanted more troops we knew that but he ... really such a memo to Johnson asking to move nuclear weapons into South Vietnam", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day":
