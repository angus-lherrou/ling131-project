in San Francisco Hi Karen welcome to the show\nI\nI Would I cannot begin right now yes go ahead you're on the air\nUm I my basic a reason for calling is to tell people about\nOf how to read the signs of if your child is being sexually abused I was four years old and what they call in a free conscious date when my grandfather began sexually abusing me and it was\nI couldn't I I was so terrified\nThat I couldn't tell anybody I felt that I was protecting my grandmother\nWhy loved completely I did tell my dad one day I said you know grab kisses kind of funny\nBut nobody saw any signs they didn't read the signs about this lasted over seven years on Sundays we had like you could go from our first level down the stairs into the basement\nAnd he would take me into this one room in our basement and\nYou know not penetration live uh within Oregon but digitally penetrate me for a long time and I I was really young and I just was able to identify with it\nYou know some things swirling above me [noise] but the science for all of their for sexual abuse I mean I began shoplifting I became kind of level like\nA you know I didn't listen to my parents I was a little rebellious but what happened was it it\nStopped my relationships with friends because I felt I had this deep dark secret I felt that was so different it eventually came out and I I did was Abe my\nIt was told to me by a counselor\nThat a sexual abuse when that starts in one generation it goes on and on to somebody puts their foot down well my children were sexually abused by my boyfriend sun\nAnd they didn't tell me but my daughter one of my daughter's in kindergarten blurted out after Thanksgiving when the teacher said how was your Thanksgiving and she said it was terrible and so she went on to tell you know the\nThe teacher about what was going on so immediately my child children were seized by child protective services and I had to go to meetings with the counselor every ... I think it was every Friday\nAnd I blurted it out when she started talking to me about what had happened to my kids and I said\nWell I went through it uh I think they can to and she said what\nShe was like flabbergasted so she opened up this talk to be about how sexual\nViolence will go through the generations and my kids and basically stopped it right there [noise] but\nI I just wanted to say basically you know women especially little girls are afraid of men they just can't speak up their freedom some kind of repercussions and that's what happened to me\n[noise] wow Karen thank you for sharing your story are are you do you mind me asking if you're seeing a therapist or getting health are your kids well\nMy kids are now in their forties\nAnd they did reach the very ... they were in a a group home for many many years and they had constantly on a daily basis unfortunately it was\nKind of base in Southern Baptists though they were scared of the church about the lake of fire that would happen if you don't [noise] they didn't adhere to the ah Baptist way of thinking\nAnd I once took them to a Chinese restaurant and they brought back the menus which has the Chinese zodiac on it and these the Southern Baptist people with your mom has brought you to the house of the devil and so they started to be a little leery of me\nBut we talked about it later on you know after they it took three years to get my children back to me but by that time they were so\nAngry and still they had been so and then they weren't allowed to leave the grounds you know they were they felt just like I felt that\nKind of isolated from the rest of the flow of their child that they do they didn't have the nice clothes they did you do have their parents were picking them up and nice cars\nAnd it did impact them so I I just wanted to tell people to really watch for signs with your children because they're there\nAnd tend to believe our children when they when they talk to us\nThat was way late in life\nIt was you know I mean it's it's kind of top down to me when my kids were already taken from the home and actually you know\nThey're thinking was\nBeen in the direction of the the strangers who I think that and I would ever have you don't met in my life unless it was after this incentive to they were taken away from me\n[noise] well thank you again Karen thank you so much for sharing and thank you for calling ... [noise] I only\nI Would just love to add there's a lot of wonderful work doing a ... or around consent for children and teaching children off at ... at it as early and he just possible or the choices in which they have around her body this is your body oh you have a choice [noise]\nWe just did a show about sex at a couple of weeks ago and unfortunately their sex ed is pretty minimal and a lot of parts of the country\nAnd some sort of those curricula don't even include consent\nRight and it's so needed [noise]\nThank you again Karen we're getting a lot of emails saying where can we email our senators about this uh ... if you go online and just write contact your senator it's pretty easy to find a list with all of the senators names and then you just hit contact and we will put that on our website at your call radio\nDot O.
