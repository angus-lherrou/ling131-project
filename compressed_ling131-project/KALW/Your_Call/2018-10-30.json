is not getting much attention at all I mean we're talking about sixteen million voters who've been purged in just two years between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen\nYes and and when you drill down on those numbers you'll find that the majority are um minorities\nUm you'll also find that the way that we don't see it is the way the voter suppression works\nAnd that it's very bureaucratic it's very um routine and methodical so it doesn't have the kind of visual power see that a Selma I'm On the Edmund Pettus bridge does move so you can wipe out sixteen million people\nAs well as some of

Native American voters for granted\nAnd he pointed out that Democrats are fuming over the disenfranchised ... uh disenfranchisement of native voters now that a Senate seat is at risk but there was very little attention and twenty Thirteen when the id law was first introduced would you agree with shot I Do\nI Do agree with that um it it had to go through the um\nThe litigation\nThe timeliness of it I mean politically they knew the the um I'm I'm supposed I represent before directions\nI Want to correct you on the I'm not the coordinator for luck with the Law Project I Do work for them in other areas but I'm presently I Am the field coordinator for\nThe for directions who are advocates for um voter protection and part of preserving our vote in Indian country um they have\nSeveral years of advocacy in the state of Montana I'm In the state of Nevada in the state of north of South Dakota and they've come here so I'm this is where I'm\nThis is where we're um\nYou utilizing all the expertise we've um\nWe've gotten the um overview an overlap of of a database and the the\nGeography of um potentially where we will be for ourselves we're laying off the map being system for ourselves as a result of what's happening here to force us to have street so um\nIt's it's not a time when you see the Supreme Court gives us um ample time this one is not giving us because I'm\nOf cabinet no I'm not voting was an advantage for them because um\nThen it three manned it to the lower court and that is held a that is held up so the appeals court is decision um who are support the legislative acts is\nHeld by the appeals court so I'm strategically politically by the Republican Party yeah\nI'm In the court system um their judges that have been appointed by Trump in the appeals court so we clearly have a picture of what is going on politically to suppress our vote to eat lemonade or vote\nAnd by doing it I'm On street address is putting obstacles on our land\nPhyllis Young is field coordinator for for directions they advocate for preserving the vote in Indian country she's also a well known Standing Rock water protector today we're also joined by Carol ... professor of African American studies at Emory University\nAnd the author of many books including one person one vote no vote [laughter] it would be nice if one person one vote when it first is no votes\nA book she argues that Donald Trump won the presidential election due to voter suppression\nSo this is getting attention but when you connect the dots what about the bigger picture sixteen million people were removed from voter rolls across the country between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen if you have any questions for ... or ... you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nEight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nPhyllis I'm Sorry Carol what can people do to find out if they have been purged and what can they do to get back\nOn the rolls\nRight and so I'm One of the key things is to go to the secretary of state's um your your your your state's secretary of state's Web page and key in your your name I'm your last name\nAnd um there's some other data that it needs and it pops up and it'll tell you if your status is pending if you have been removed\nUm because part of what happens is that with these purges people basically aren't told and so when they go to vote 'em they're not on the rolls and did they are getting the big run around and and it just becomes a mess um [noise]\nSo that is one of the things is to be very proactive I Know that when we had um our registration period was open I checked my voter Web page um every week and then I printed off a copy with the date and time on it\nUm so that I had documented proof that I was in fact a registered voter and that this was my polling place I'm One of the things I'd like to add Phyllis talked about how the Republicans I'm\nCrafted the laws knowing that the way that you would attack the land and the people's right to vote was to go after the one thing that they didn't have was an address that is how these laws are crafted and that's why they're so efficient I'm sill effective because they look reasonable\nPeople say well everybody's got an id but the way that these legislatures craft the laws it's certain types of ID so like in Alabama you need a government issued photo ID but they said that public housing id\nDid not count as if that's not a government issued photo ID and that's because Seventy one percent of those in public housing in Alabama are African American\nThen they said but a driver's license will count then the government shutdown the department of motor vehicles in those black belt counties so what you do is you create an obstacle voter id based on the lie of voter fraud\nAnd then you create an obstacle to that obstacle that's how I'm Republicans are able to suppress the vote and that's what they have to do because their policies which have veered so far to the right no longer resonate with the majority of Americans in a particularly in an increasingly diverse America\nFill us before we let you go ... can you tell us how listeners can support your efforts\nThe New York times had profile piece about what you're doing and OJ ... executive director of for directions said that people don't understand how much it costs to try\nTo make sure that every tribal member has the right to vote the tribes have invested thousands of dollars and equipment and man hours meetings and these things are not cheap so what's the best way we can support your efforts to ensure that people can vote\nWe do we did we are ... um and\nAnd um we\nWere overwhelmed to in our enrollment office um to get new IDs um we're trying to start a second operation um we have six days left we think that we can we have to hire new staff um we\n[noise] what is the opposition to all of this because groups like the ACLU there's a number of new voting rights groups there's\nVoting rights groups have colored doing really great work on the ground is work where the Democrats an olive is I mean you just have to wonder why things have gotten worse since two thousand what are they doing\nAnd so what we're seeing and I and I've got to say that where I it it you began to see this churn happening clearly in two thousand [noise] um and and the Republicans have been very good at messaging\nVoter fraud voter fraud voter fraud we're trying to protect the integrity of the ballot box and so it looks like when you're pushing back on that\nThat what you're seeing what you're actually saying although it's not what you're saying is that you just want anybody to be able to run up there and vote you want to take the election so this is the kind of narrative box that the Democrats had been put in\nThere fighting their way out of it one of the things that we're seeing is that a former attorney general Eric Holder as a president Barack Obama have formed an an organization\nThat's going after one of the most insidious methods of voters\nUm and what gerrymandering does and we will talk about Wisconsin because Wisconsin kind of gives you that kind of Clinton central feel of it after the ... election\nUm the Republicans are locked or a small number of the lock themselves in a hotel room sequestered themselves in a hotel room with some powerful mapping software and began to redraw the legislative boundaries districts for the state now constitutionally that's what\nIt's supposed to happen you're supposed to after a census redraw the boundaries to reflect the population shifts but what they did their two goals was one to eat eliminate the number of competitive districts\nBecause when you eliminate competitive districts\nVoter turnout goes down because you are you already know who's gonna win I make is running unopposed there's no way the source was going to win so people just don't show up in a competitive races people show up\nThe second thing that it's the second goal but they had was that ... guard lists of how many votes they received they would always have the majority of seats\nIn the state legislature\n... by the time the first election happened in twenty twelve Democrats receive fifty two percent of the vote but only thirty nine percent of the seats\nAnd the subsequent elections it got worse\nAnd that's one extreme partisan gerrymandering does\nIt creates these districts where ... where the politicians get to choose their voters instead of the voters getting to choose who they are elected officials will be and it also makes those politicians immune from voters will by the way that these districts are crafted so that is really hard to dislodge them\nThat is why we see national policy moving in one direction for instance on the Affordable CARE Act or on the tax law while we see the American people in their polling in their desires in there was moving in the opposite direction so\nGerrymandering has created a completely on representative house of representatives\nSo you see holder and Obama now going for a non partisan redistricting commissions to to eliminate\nUm that that that pernicious evil that is in the system and to create a district thing that is fair that is balanced in that is responsive to the will of the voters\n[noise] can you elaborate more on gerrymandering Carol we've done a lot of shows about gerrymandering and David daily has a great book called rat and if the true story secret plan to steal America's democracy and according to David daily end the Brennan Center for justice\nIn order for Democrats to take back the house and certain districts they have to win by about eleven margin points so can you explain why that is\nAnd that is because not only they they drew these districts with this powerful mapping software that has this almost like I'll say Facebook Cambridge Analytica data that shows the proclivities of of different houses different streets\nUm is this a Prius driving luck taste sipping neighborhood here okay so how do we just use that what they're thinking as liberal\nUm neighborhood is so they began to to to annex it to craft that district and put it into a a larger district that is overwhelmingly see a white conservative and to overwhelm those\nCalled cracking them by splitting them up into multiple district so their voice\nNever heard and so in order to to dislodge these folks these folks who I'm\nVoting to uh got got health insurance and protections for people with preexisting conditions\nIt requires such a massive turnout and what the Republicans count on\nIs that democratic voters basically do show up that's what they've been banking on voter suppression is designed to do that as I said gerrymandering is designed to make you believe that the system is so rigged it ... it does it you shouldn't participate it doesn't matter if you participate\nBut that is wrong it does matter if you participate that is why they're so afraid of what's been called the blue wave with the blues the nominee that is why they're so afraid of this kind of massive early voting turnout that they're seeing that is why they have done all of this voter suppression\nBecause they are afraid of democracy\n[noise] Carolyn Anderson is professor of African American studies at Emory University\nAuthor of several books including one person no vote how voter suppression is destroying our democracy she argues that Donald Trump won the election due to voter suppression and if you have any questions for Carol about voter suppression and gerrymandering\nWhat are your thoughts about this and how to tackle that I mean it is pretty overwhelming and when you think about all the damage that this administration is doing and Carol argues he shouldn't even be in the White House I mean if it weren't for voter suppression he probably would not have one\nEight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email\nYour call at K. A. L. W. dot org [noise]\nWe have an email from Jane who says the most effective method of stealing elections is one which has been in place for the past few elections electronic software manipulation of the vote counting machines and this is not getting attention\nSo Carol have you been keeping up with what's happening in Texas where if people vote like a straight Democratic Party and hop it says they voted for Ted Cruz not Beto O'Rourke better or if\nThey mess up and yes and you know that's happening here as well so the Georgia N. double ACP has now sued because um there are voting machines here so\nAs I said Brian Kemp ... is our secretary of state and he was war during the Obama years that are voting machines were vulnerable to hacking\nAre voting machines run on windows two thousand\nAnd do not have a paper trail uh uh-huh [noise] well and\nHe refused refused refused refused\nUntil um\nThere was a convincing the DEF CON convention in Las Vegas they get twenty sixteen or twenty Seventeen\nAnd boom some hackers who weren't even\nIn in voting software got into the machine with the the whole Georgia system within a matter of minutes\nThen he was willing to accept some federal dollars but whether those machines have been changed because during this election people are screen shot and that when they're voting for Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent\nThat when they get to the final page it showing that they voted for Brian Kemp so the votes are being switched here as well so yes and that is why we have over\nOnly way to do it right yes if this because at this point because what we have to do is to get\nThese folks out of power who are in power based on voter suppression and we have to elect people who fully believe in the vibrancy of democracy who fully believe that American citizens have the right to vote\nAnd who are thinking through ways to ensure that that happened until we do that an area Berman wrote a beautiful piece on this\nUntil we do that we will continue to have to spend all of this time in court all of this time screen shot and all of this time trying to figure out\nHow do we move around how do we\nSimply exercise or basic right to vote", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
