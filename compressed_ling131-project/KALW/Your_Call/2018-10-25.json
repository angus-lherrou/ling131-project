assisting undercover investigators for compassion over killing\nIf you're in the San Francisco area Scott will be speaking at the world ... festival this Saturday at one o'clock at the San Francisco county fair fair building and Golden Gate park that's one one nine nine ninth avenue and Scott joins us in Studio Hi Scott welcome to the show\nHello up and ... it's great to have you how did you end up doing this work\nYou're ... I have to say you're pretty young if you don't mind me saying that and this is this is pretty intense work how did you end up doing it\n... ah actually I probably got into it a partially because ah I was you know pretty young ... when I started\nI had just gotten out of school I had done a masters in a plot ecology uh so I was really just looking for any sort of job as a lot of young people that are just come out of school are doing\nAre looking for anything where I could help animals whether it was like a researcher a nonprofit job anything like that so I was just scouring the job sites typing animal and so the search bar things like that and actually\nA compassionate were killings ad came up there looking for undercover investigators I'm a first those kind of skeptical I was surprised a but you could hire spies on line of you know\nA there probably aren't too many out of work spies looking for jobs or anything like ... uh but I\nWas intrigued accord bum yeah to a noticed said you\nKnow experience required a witch spoke to me as a young person a thought you know it's perfect I don't have an experience and I'm looking for a job I can help animals like this so why not try it and so I applied for a few months later\nAfter a lengthy process I got the job and I was out in the field\nYou spent just over a year at three different slaughter houses that kill chickens lamb and pigs right how do you all decide which slaughterhouses to I guess you're applying for a job there right\nThe guardian piece you wrote about your experience equality part processors in Minnesota He wrote that you're caught supervisor who is in charge of overseeing the process where pigs are stunned and rendered unconscious before their threats are sled sleeping on the job\nAnd then you also say that another employee said to you on camera quote if the USDA is around they could shut us down\nAnd quote right or the fact\nIs that the USDA isn't around all that often I mean um it's pretty rare offer the USDA to ah\nTo give enforcement actions or to some of these plants I actually did a blog ... on the the okay website we have a new investigators series where you can hear a investigators talk about their experiences I did one for this plant a\nWhere they got like foreign sportsmen actions in the past two years which was kind of a lot for a plant a ... for the most part\nThe USDA they don't issue a lot because they're not around a lot to see all many of these so\nMany of these actions that should be a violation of a humane methods of slaughter act I\nI saw in my best occasions red pigs are returning to sensibility um lambs still being sensible as their tails are being cut into a after a stunning and they should have been a worthy of enforcement actions but unfortunately because of USDA's not around they don't see this stuff\nOut and no one there are no repercussions for it [noise] ah so I mean I saw\nLost right and that's okay because you remember when you when that employee said to you at the USDA's around that could shut us down what was that Rick ... referring to exactly right you remember\nAn animal or returning to sensibility on\nOne class of about animal\nRight was trying to write itself it already been stunned his uh his or her throat already been\nCut off so that animal should've been bled out already sort of died without returning a sensibility unfortunately a he or she did not and um you know if the USDA has seen it\nThat would have been a violation of human motives of Flora\nToday we're speaking with Scott David who spent to just over a year working undercover inside of\nA different slaughterhouses across the country that killed pigs lamb and chickens and then he spent about a year doing research\nAnd Scott now does more research for compassion ever killing an organization that works to an animal abused by focusing on cruelty to animals and again I just want to say that when Scott's talking about what he saw there's definitely going to be some graphic\nDescriptions maybe some of you have seen the horrific videos in fact the footage that Scott got\nWas used by national media outlets and what what are your thoughts when you see this kind of footage that now thanks to social media I mean a lot of this cruelty\nIs being exposed but what are your thoughts about these practices\nYou can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five there's so much more information out now about our food system how it affects animals humans workers how it affects the planet\nAnd the more that you learn how does that affect you and the choices that you make eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email feed your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nYou also captured footage at superior farms in California which is the largest producer of lamb in the country and they supply Walmart and Kroger and this was released earlier last year\nThe video shows workers slashing lands throats and cutting off their tails while conscious according to veggie news USDA chief veterinarian meat inspectors Lester Castro free lander\nClassify those actions as violations of the humane method of slaughter act\nBoth superior farms and ... are very large suppliers and again we were talking about this earlier but how widespread is this I mean do we know how many massive slaughter houses are there in this country at this point\nI'm not quite sure how many ... slaughterhouses in total oh there are but I mean ... Ninety plus percent of all a\nAnimals right or a factory farmed in America and uh there really aren't a lot of you know smaller slot her slaughterhouses left so you know the vast vast majority are these\nHuge huge places from these huge corporations are so you can you can pretty much I expect that a lot of them are going to run a\nWe somewhat similar to us right now like I said speed is just everything abuse points they want to push as many animals through as possible you want to\nGet as much product through as possible because I've just means more product for them a bad for the animals people rush in their handling of them and it's bad for the workers so when I was at a at the chickens water\nPlace that I worked out so I we have to hang in shackles a twenty four chickens permitted so roughly one every couple of seconds and there's there's no way to handle a twenty four animal\nOf human matter you just you can't do it right\nOn this is what you'll see especially in a chicken slaughter plants alive hang its matory sleek fast uh it's ... just a horrible job for people to work in uh the turnover rate at some of these plants is like over a hundred percent so there are\nLosing basically a what\nA mouse all their workers each year because no one wants to work in these jobs because of how hard they are\nPeople are having their hands swell up and they're getting carpal tunnel syndrome or they're getting something called claw hand where their hands are stuck in a club\nLike position clothes because they cause they're tendons which is swollen up so much um this is very much common knowledge within ... within the industry this is just how\nAre these plans operates now you worked alongside the workers in slaughterhouses or they mostly immigrants\nUh yes very much so uh depends on place the place where the you know people are from a obviously a lot of Mexican immigrants uh when I was at quality pork or actually a lot of uh African immigrants as well as a Asian immigrants uh you know people from Myanmar\nPlace like that were you able to talk to them and find out more about their lives and how they ended up there had are treated ... ah\nNot too much I mean there's a some sort of language language barrier between uh some of the employees are but\nIn general just the treatment of ah workers at these plants is abhorrent right they have to work a incredibly fast they do the same repetitive motions or thousands and thousands of times a day when I was in life hang you just shackled chickens all day that was the only thing that you ever did\nHow you were in a dark room or for the entire time and there was feces and feathers and blood flying around and it would get into your shirts and you know into any every ... your body ah workers there used to wrap themselves up in the break room with a with\nPaper towel or\nAround their back to support themselves and then around every opening up their sleeves are around their necks just to prevent all of this a blood and feces from getting in and even then it's not perfect seal when I\nI took a shower at night there would just be feces and blood just and feathers all over the drain\nIowa Public radio did a story about workers and meat packing plants on by Tyson Foods than they found that in the first nine months of twenty fifth Fifteen there was one amputation a month one sanitation worker in Missouri lost both hands on the job [noise]\nI mean this is also very difficult dangerous work great in addition to being exposed to what you just described right dangerous right yeah definitely\nA lot of applications and people are working in close quarters with not just heavy machinery but even with other people or so people are getting\nHands are stuck in machinery or they're working with knives are all day I saw was uh they're\nPretty much shoulder to shoulder with the person next to them sometimes so people are rent moving their lives around a lot of people will get a second hand cuts from people around them I can definitely be a be dangerous or there's actually\nA chronicle [noise] uh uh there's a book a about the quality pork a slaughterhouse\nThat I was at where people were actually getting a strange like neurological disease there and it was from they discovered eventually ingesting pigs brain\nControl that are from there and we'll get numb oh there they would lose control of the legs and as far as I Know a lot of those are symptoms never abated\nThey they definitely have a lot to spend on a influencing a policy right uh so I really think you would the USDA and with government in general are\nReally there's just there's too much\nMoney I'm being poured in from these huge companies and they\nDidn't get to\nEssentially a determine how the how they're going to\nBe a inspected a how people are going to look at them that's why are they have new programs like the new high speed slaughter programs because these companies are pushing for such things are so I really think that is just a money issue\nAs to you know why there are more like enforcement actions why there is a more oversight um I think there definitely use the inspectors are that you would agree and think that there should be more\nAh but yeah the the money is uh the problem with that\n[noise] that talked business reported that last year Tyson Foods recorded a record profits and Tom Hayes who was named president of the company in June ... earned total compensation of about almost nine million\nBut this is a billion dollar industry that we're talking about right right exactly well thank you for the call John ah let's go next to Iran\nScott Taylor I ended up on my question was how would you advise people to a vote on proposition twelve that's coming up in the election\nI bet you for that question I was a definitely planning to touch on that\nYes and so this is on the ballot here in California it's a state wide proposition first tell us what this would do Scott\nRight also prop twelve would give a very clear space requirements for how laying hens a and just dating pigs as well as bill caps are kept at\nA new would also prevent in California the sale of any animal products or even from out of state producers uh where animals are\nKept in intensive confinement conditions are that are lower than what these requirements would put forth\nA so it's a huge huge sweeping change a\nCalifornia right is a huge uh economy people want to sell their products here um\nCompanies are just going to you know forego California and say you know we're not going to sell anything\nIn the state because we're a gigantic economy uh so it's going to very much push a lot of a farmer's a lot of companies into treating these animals are better\nInto giving them a more space right and a four legged egg egg laying hens they would've eventually band cages as well or by twenty twenty two of another thing I forgot to mention a so it is going to be a huge change a\nIt is a welfare initiative obviously it's not abolitionists which I think um [noise]\nGive some people some pause some groups are but it is a huge step forward a towards eradicating\nSome of the most in my opinion egregious a standard practice practices in the industry which is intensive confinement animals also definitely are today a yes vote on prop twelve\nI'm actually kind of want to go back to uh the last question I forgot to John yeah about two to answer out his thoughts on uh\nUnions in these places of it they definitely have unions and some of them are but\nIn a lot of these places to a these are companies will actively fighting against the unions and\nI remember at the chicken fought our place I was that they actually had a huge banner in the break room are talking about how like unions were trying to steal people's money and stuff like that ah so there's definitely some uh some effort by these companies to lessen the power of unions are so these workers can be more easily taken advantage\nOf you know again we we talk a lot about slaughterhouse and when high profile environmentalists are on the show I ... I always try to ask them\nYou know you talk about showers and water and driving less and biking and all of those good things but they rarely although it's changing now they're starting to say you know eat less meat\nBut a couple of years ago they really didn't and I asked I don't ever forget this I asked one pretty prominent environmentalist you know why don't you talk more about this and he said well you can name oil companies Chevron Exxon shell\nEven in five of them off the top of your head right now how many people can name five firehouse companies and he said that's why we don't talk about it because we don't have the names we don't have these are not household names so can you talk about that a bit I mean most people are familiar with Tyson\nAt it they they slaughter cows pigs and chickens they're the second largest pork and chicken ... in the United states Cargill uh wow I'm I'm looking right now at a high country news\nAnd this is a company that runs the biggest [noise]\nThey will they do corn syrup and things also um but they also slaughter animals um national beef packing company there's Smith field which is one of the biggest pigs letter companies so these are massive corporations that we're talking about but you don't really hear the names of them people always say factory farming and\nSlaughter industry sure sure about that yeah I mean you can definitely see the names if you go to stores and you know pick out your own product a but it's definitely much harder to see where your food is coming from if you're you know just buying like a\nCheeseburger at a restaurant ... separately pretty hard then to recognize who say like McDonald's suppliers are Burger King suppliers any restaurant like that um they\nNormally don't really advertise a that stuff too much um at least like in their normal advertisements although you can find the information if you\nGo looking for it um so there's a problem with that and also just a general transparency issue a within the industry right they want to put forth a all these um sort of whitewashed ads that say things with their animals are taken care of and that they're\nDoing their best or for the planet and they're like environmentally responsible and things of that nature ah so I think it is really important to have these undercover investigations than where we can see you know just what happens in these places are we going to see what these companies are\nNot being truthful about on we can show the public things that they don't normally see and we can\nA name these suppliers a that would normally sort of be invisible because you know you just go out to eat all the time so you're not really sure who's making anything\nTo to the airplanes about the ... ad campaigns\nWe hear a lot about humane slaughter and ruby rights and these stories are absolutely horrible tell me tell me pleased at the beef we eat and other animal products that are labeled organic\nGrass fed pasture raised are not subjected to this torment I Want to think that they are quote sacrificed with care and lovely arms right she goes on to say these practices make for big arguments to become the again\nThanks for airing this subject and thank you to Scott for your\nWork you're very welcome and uh unfortunately I cannot tell you that any of these products that are labeled with things like humanely raised them things like that uh I Can't tell you that\nUh they are actually a accurate right um some of these uh label their third party labels on they are\nRight the farms are infrequently checked all the time uh and honestly there aren't very many uh\nUh there are a lot of people that actually go and check up on whether these labels are accurate right you can just put these labels on products and\nHonestly people normally won't know the ... or even if you hadn't changed anything at all I remember one of compassion over killings earlier investigations or were they were at a egg layer a hen farm spent and\nThe eggs that were coming out of these forms they had this a label on them said like animal care certified and there was a big deal people bought into it you know they thought these chickens were being treated way better than your average a bird but when I see okay went in we see that it was\nCompletely the same as or any other ah I glare farm any other ... farm they were in these tiny battery cages and ...\nKind of ... and you know they were getting wings and legs stuck in the bars and even if they did escape these cages sometimes they would fall into these huge manure pits down below and die in their ah we actually\nTook these findings uh\nTo the authorities and they said uh they\nRuled that these labels couldn't be used anymore because they were being dishonest on unfortunately sometimes it takes stuff like undercover investigations on or a to really tell how these animals are being treated no matter what the label\nSays have there been many other investigations and places that say that they're humane", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "25"}
