A. L. W. dot O. R. G. and if you're in the bay area on and we'll be speaking tonight at the world affairs council in San Francisco three one two setter sweets as street and then tomorrow night he'll\nBe speaking at the S. C. H. P. conference what does that stand\nFor soak up so kept social capital\nSocial capital the social capital conference at the Fort Mason center Tim arena boulevard you can find more information at your call radio dot org that's at eight thirty in the morning in San Francisco what is\nThe social and there's another there's another event tomorrow evening also third option okay I'm a code for America is is hosting and all of that's on my Twitter on rights\nOkay what is the social capital conference\n[noise] um I don't know in detail it's basic this idea of social capital is using capital\nTo to advance the greater good it's precisely what I'm ... yeah um and so my you know my guess is always the emphasis is on cap and not so but I'm going to go find out and you know they're gonna they're gonna go find out what I think\nAnd why are they inviting you to these conferences given what you're talking about\nI think it's a great question and but I Will say the following that that is my\nProbably biggest takeaway from two months on the road um and my children almost not recognizing the anymore\nWhich is I think Donald Trump has done this country one enormous service\nWhich is Donald Trump is for this nation um\nWhat rock bottom is in the life of many addicts when you when you managed turnaround that night that makes you can be convinced that they can't be another night like this [noise] and\nWhat I've found is that a lot of the winners of our age the very people\nAre more open right now to introspection and to self examination than they were even a year or two ago when I was doing this reporting because if Donald Trump is president\nIt means that a lot of what all of us thought was simply not true if Donald Trump is president it means that our assumptions about how to make the society work better we're just\nFlawed in so many ways you don't get an orange Mussolini without multiple system failures in this country without so many of us\nThinking faulty things and so I every day I'm encountering people in these elite space I kind of thinking where were you when I was reporting this book um who are actually saying look\nI think X Y and Z but what do I know because Trump's president let's have a conversation\nMaybe I Need to change maybe my assumption is that to change maybe ... it's a change I'm getting people out of the woodwork kids have accepted jobs and investment banks out of college thing you know what maybe I should revoke that and do something else what else should I Do you know I'm not a\nCareer counselor but so I I Try to pass them on in the best way I can um people who are at large foundations saying OK I'm persuaded that I'm just upholding the system instead of actually shot or how can I give in ways that would shatter\nUm there is an openness right now in our country that is the warm underbelly of 'em this ghastly era\n[noise] in the book you write about the Clinton Foundation and you have a bunch of quotes from Bill Clinton's you interview him I did okay that part made me really mad because here he is this you know brilliant thinker\nAnd he was talking to you about NAFTA basically it just in line with what you're saying right now well when\nWe pass NAFTA maybe we should have added certain protections for workers well maybe we should have done this and it was but I guess what gets me the most is all of these people saying maybe we should have\nYou have all of these grassroots organizations an active as to how we're banging on the streets same these same things for years they got it right decades ago and yet here we are exactly what they said what happened happened\nAnd yet these guys that let the brightest and the bright are now saying oh maybe we made a mistake\nI think one of the things that's so interesting about Trump is actually making people rethink I'm not sure how much has made Bill Clinton personally rethink but others is Trump is like a late warning system\nFor public discontent unbroken systems but a late warning system is not a very useful tool what you want is an early warning system an early warning systems are those activists you talked about I mean I remember\nYou know Nineteen Ninety nine when you add those protested the WTO in Seattle and they were kind of dismissed\nAs marginal people fringe people mean occupy you know twelve years later was a Thirteen Years later was was similarly dismissed um I went to University of Michigan and I took econ one oh one either my freshman or sophomore year Nineteen Ninety nine or two thousand\nAnd I remember we were in Michigan\nAnd I remember learning and econ one oh one at the University of Michigan like trade and general benefits all parties and ... and we were in Michigan [laughter] if you drove half an hour\nFrom any in any direction from that campus you saw the trade was shattering the society shattering it\nRight and the econ textbooks I would've said in the professor said what\nAnd the fifth or tens of American Life were completely impervious\nTo all these people saying hey globalization not working for us hey trade not working for us hey this tech thing actually not lifting all boats there was so much incoming transmission to put it in radio terms but the elites in this country in those years in these ears have only had out out bound transmitters\nOr whether it's academia we're now basically every one's an adjunct I mean this woman who just won the Nobel Prize in physics had not yet been promoted the full professor\nRight um and even book publishing where advance nonprofit nonfiction advances are down and and you know there's like one big bookstore\nI'm a lot of those with the kind of traditional sources of patronage for writers and thinkers what were those things all wilting what is taking the space of that will take it up picked up the slack as the speaker circuit\nAnd you can speak it us Aspen Ideas festival and and Ted where you don't get paid but you get exposure or you can speak and he's got a corporate lectures and what happens is\nYou know I'm as Upton Sinclair is that it's difficult to get them into understand something when his salary depends on who's not understanding it these these thinkers are invariably\nFeel kind of pressure to change their diagnoses or leave a little bit of it out and change their prescriptions 'em to meet the taste of their benefactors and that happens in every age with its patrons but I Try to chronicle how in this age with these particular patrons has got it\nWe've ended up kind of nursing a contrary of thinkers whose expertise is to talk about social problems in ways that do not blame the winners and\n[noise] well and to your point about that I won't name the name but we had an author of a really important book on recently who said that at night he barks hands because he can't make ends meet and he just wrote such an important book and then there have been so many stories about adjunct who\nIn many cases are one paycheck away from being homeless um there was one article recently about a professor at is the San jose State University who grates papers in her car by the light of ahead lamp I mean this is very common now and it seems to be really getting worse in this area\nLook especially I mean what you're raising our examples of of something much bigger which is we have to decide what kind of society we want to be yeah\nUm I think one of the darkest examples of our time there was this beautiful and and dark New York times piece a few years ago about the ends are college I'm In South Bay\nWhich is I think probably the closest higher educational institution to apple in Cupertino and as apple thrives I think now has two hundred and eighty five billion dollars offshore\nDMV though where many apple employees kids swim to swim lessons or which is right there [noise] um ... I was suffering\nCutbacks not having the money to employs many teachers a lot of people moving to adjunct I think the horses were slashed twenty five percent one year they just couldn't make ends meet and we're talking a couple of miles from\nFrom the ... or the apple campus in Cupertino and you just think look there's a lot of ways to have some of that money go there could be through taxes could with your ... or whatever um and I have my preferences but you just step back before that and say what kind of society\nCreates a company to build all this technology uses these idealistic ads about making the world a better place to sell that technology generates two hundred and eighty five billion dollars simply an offshore wells\nAnd allows a community college where the children of the employees of that company swim to weather on the vine do we is that the kind of society we want to be [noise] um it's certainly not the kind of society I Want to live in ...\n[noise] we have an email from ... who says maybe it was a charming move but went on and said how happy he was to be back in this studio in my heart sank\nThe KLW studio is way far from the Aspen Institute at the care with which he is listening to roll with me and engaging with her questions convince me of his sincerity and professionalism a rare pair of attributes I'm excited to read more about his research and his critique of\nUm of what we're talking about today\nAnd I I Am back I was here seven years ago for my first book so I'm I'm I I Am indeed ... it's a I remember I remember driving around looking for the first time to\nEat well and it's it's been a while I mean and for people who you know I Would like to know more about you I mean how did you find yourself in this world of the wealthy and the powerful I mean you talk about how you you got lucky and choosing your parents and they sent you to really good private schools\nUm but how did you end up for example at the Aspen Institute for so long\nWell look I ... I mean a lot of these I'm very wealthy and powerful corporate people um have these ... these kinda fellowships and they and they always allow and I think\nIs as boring a room as you could conceive of so they often lead in some other people you know with a little more um liberty in color and their lives artists um you know some\nPhilanthropic people journalists writers whatever um so I was one of those people on the fellowship but but to take the question more broadly I you know I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio my father call this the original Cleveland Indians um my parents are immigrants from India and uh\nWe you know had a ... they had this kind of classic American immigrant story they left Indiana had this great built this great life in Ohio and then I Lived in France for three years my dad got a job in France um than who lived in the suburbs Washington DC for several years\nAnd I became a I knew very early on I Want to be a writer um and\nYou know became a writer really in India I moved to India after college um and I was a European history major and I just wanted to move to India and there's basically no plausible connection between setting European history and and\nGetting a job in India so I applied for a job at the place that really does not care what you know I'm just send you anywhere which is McKenzie so I got this job I'm In India Office of McKinsey and as soon as I got there I realized that I was a disaster for it and it was a disaster for me but\nI managed to kind of get myself to India I was within weeks advising an Indian pharmaceutical company on its leadership development system even though I didn't do nothing about India pharmaceuticals or leadership\nUm that there I was and it just felt very fraudulent to me um and so I immediately started looking for other things as soon as I got there but I was there so that was an advantage\nAnd I had applied for these journalism drop before I left and they said no we're not sending it to India but once I was in India was a little easier and I got hired by the New York times and the international Herald Tribune to become a correspondent there when I was\nUm because twenty three and um and and kind of never looked back wrote my first book about\nIndia that's a book I came here to talk about seven years ago um to have and a half years ago about the transformation of modern India called India Calling 'em then came back to this country in two thousand nine and\nA John Stewart actually on that same book tour that brought me here John Stewart captured what in many ways been the story of my life with in his in his brilliant way with a one liner um he said you know your India but basically says the American dream is alive and well but only in India\nAnd in some ways that's been the thesis of my of my work I told this extraordinary story of\nThe rise of hope in India and came back to this country in two thousand nine and saw that hope was drying up at the source I'm sort of second book about that about a hate crime in Texas that kind of brought up those questions of the two Americas\nI'm and\nI'm you know around the time my first book was invited into this fellowship as kind of one of the weirdos to be kept around um I wasn't really in their world I didn't really you know I didn't have a house in Aspen or a jet or anything like that but I you know living in a modest life in Brooklyn but at the same time\nGot to be adjacent to a lot of those spaces and and it's common with a lot of writers and journalists um and and began to feel a lot of misgivings with the world that I was now around\nWhat [noise] sense of responsibility do you feel at this time because you know again what you're saying and number of active ... people who work for groups that are working too\nWho are an housed I mean there's some people doing really great work and they don't have the opening that you do they're not being invited to Google they're not being invited to the Aspen Institute right so what sort of responsibility do you feel at this point given that you do have all of these open doors and they don't\nA tremendous one I mean that's that's the power of reporting right I mean I interviewed people like that and spent time with them and talk to them all the time in order to be able to you know I think as a as a reporter\nYou are the intermediary between\nPeople's stories and people who might or might not listen to those stories I'm an off and people are kind of unwilling or unable to listen to people directly that's changing and the Twitter age when there's a lot more distant or mediation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23"}
