News\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome I'm Renee Kemp sitting in for rose Aguilar and this is your calls one planet series today we're talking to author and investigative journalist Antonio you cause\nHer latest Pacific Standard cover story is entitled death on the Dakota access it's an investigation into the deadly business a building oil\nAnd gas pipelines for the first time you has has compiled detailed fatality rates for those who actually build us oil and gas pipelines and her findings tell a very disturbing story about worker safety of the lack of industry regulation\nAnd the environmental destruction that has followed the oil and gas boom here in the United states she goes back to twenty sixteen or when oil and gas pipeline construction workers were dying on the job on average more than three and a half times more often than the average American worker\nSo why is that she writes about the new plan for us global fossil fuel dominance and she pairs those findings with the current Trump policy that requires expanding and even fast tracking new drilling and pipeline construction and at the same time\nDecreasing regulation and oversight\nOr you houses predicting that at this rate the United states is destined to increase the number of these workers on oil and gas pipeline construction who are either injured or who die on the job\nSo how's this industry regulated and who takes care of these workers to look into these issues we're joined in Studio by Antonio you ... and she's a long time oil and energy investigative journalist in fact and I don't think anybody knows more about this industry\nA than Antonio she's author of three books most recently\n[noise] ah the title black tied\nAnd um it deals with the devastating impact of the Gulf Oil spill so so good to have you back Antonio thanks so much for having me Renee agreed to be with you yes indeed and again uh you've dedicated your career to looking at but the oil and gas industry\nAnd before we get into um the most recent research that you've done or you did and black tie\nIn two thousand ten that explosion and fire killed eleven people on that platform in the Gulf of Mexico and you said that you went into a submarine and uh actually took a look at the environmental damage and so what did you learn from from that experience [noise]\nYeah so um [noise] the Deepwater Horizon disaster happened in two thousand and ten or the initial explosion happened in April two thousand and ten\nAnd that was and remains the worst offshore drilling I'm I'm a explosion in history the worst offshore drilling oil and gas incident in in world history the largest amount of oil spilled\nAnd it included the death of eleven workers on the rig\nAnd there were many lessons that I learned from that or an ongoing investigation and not only did I write the book black tied but continued to return again and again reporting for magazines like Rolling Stone and Harper's Magazine and the nation um to continue to return and see what continues to happen in the Gulf\nAnd the impacts on the families of those who lost loved ones and workers who are on the rig at the time of the\nUm disaster and on the environment and on the economies of the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd there wasn't a prohibition on shipping gasoline which we were also increasingly exporting out of the United states during that period as well so um\nThe reason for the increase in production really had to do it began under the Bush administration and it was a combination of the Bush administration relax\nAnd under what conditions or they could drill a combination of that and\nNew technology making fracking easier and more affordable for companies fracking fracking extract natural gas from there it's also oil so fracking is just a technique\nBy which you blast using a giant water and chemicals cannon you go underground you blast using this cannon\nUm you blast rock in which oil is found so whereas traditionally most oil is found and what is not exactly the kind of equivalent to driven underground reservoir of oil and used a ... pipe into it and I'm making is much more simple than it actually is and that oil comes out very fairly simply\nOil or natural gas that is trapped with in rock formations under the ground has to be released from those rock formations and fracking is a way of hydraulic the hydraulic\nFracturing of the rock so had rallied means water so you're laughing it with water and chemicals okay water and chemical Costco and that technology combined with the deregulation of the Bush administration as well as the desire of the Bush administration to really help oil and gas companies make more money\nUm is what led to the beginning of the boom boom was then carried on from administration to administration to administration\nIt's always so helpful to get oil and gas one on one of us [laughter]\nBecause you know we tend to once again just to go to the pump or turn on the the pilot light and just assume that it's going to be there but um there are consequences environmental and in terms of worker health and safety if you're just joining us Antonio you has\nIs here and we're talking today about her most recent research into literally the human cost of the oil and gas\nIndustry so I'm In may have twenty sixteen of the construction on the pipeline the\nDakota Access pipeline a began its about twelve hundred miles long how unusual is this particular construction project\nI'm so this is this is the largest pipeline ever to be built out of North Dakota um we have seen a boom in oil and gas pipeline construction that coincided with the oil and gas\nProduction boom and rapid increase in pipeline construction\nSo wrap it in fact and again this is similar to where we started with BP Deepwater Horizon disaster where again I said that the judge's final ruling in the case was very clear that BP had put saving time and money over safety I'm In and she wanted to\nSay yeah go ahead exact words were BP was I'm guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct and ah so but there was no real consequence so\nI mean there were many ... there was a there was the largest um judgment against any oil company ever for environmental bused in the case of BP um it was I don't have these numbers memorized in my head anymore right now but around sixty billion dollar judgment but it gives you a sense of how big these companies are that that was a drop in the bucket for BP so BP is is\nPerfectly financially healthy today after facing what was the largest environmental judgment by any um US court against ah against an oil company\nSome lessons learned in terms of the consequences if companies who are doing the construction on these pipelines they figure they just kind of break that into their financial cake\nWell I mean I I I think that there were many lessons learned and the Obama administration for example started putting in place new regulations on offshore drilling which the Trump Administration eliminated the Obama administration started putting in place new regulations for occupational safety and Health Administration OSHA which overseas\nIn place energy regulations and environmental regulations um Fifteen hundred of which the Trump Administration has removed three hundred just in the energy sector alone so there were a lot of lessons learned\nUm and they've been on learned with under the new administration not to say the Obama administration did or anything close to everything that could and should have been done but it learned a lot\nStudied a lot and put in place many good ah reforms\nI Would say almost all of which have been eviscerated under this administration but\nWhat is very similar for the pipeline companies is this speed the necessity for speed and saving time and saving money at the expense of worker environment on community health and safety so since two thousand and ten\nOil and natural gas pipelines and pipelines carrying all hazardous materials which oil is a part mhm are significantly more likely to fail than pipelines built at any time in the last century\nIn other words the new or the pipe line in the United states the more dangerous it is the more likely it is to explode to rupture to um have an incident during its construction or once it's done to put someone in the hospital either community member or a worker and that's because of\nThe um lack of appropriate regulations lack of appropriate oversight and the companies just moving for speed ah and and saving money without being held to appropriate regulatory account\nAnd that is ah what happened with the Dakota access pipeline which where we started this discussion the ... this was it\nWas an extremely unique pipelines for many reasons but also\nNot that unique oil pipelines are getting built across the United states but this was the one that got attention which is why I was there and the first place which is why I happened to notice when Troy Dolan died while the pipeline was being constructed which is then what led me to investigate and open an entirely unfortunately entirely new area\nOf investigation looking into that they ... of oil and gas pipeline construction workers because they're the bureau of Labor Statistics publishes fatality rate data\nFor almost all industries that's where we get a tally rate data for industries in the United states they have only occasionally done so for oil and gas production and they have never ever done so for oil and gas pipeline construction so I did that work myself\nIt's extraordinary you would think it would almost seem to follow that lessons would have been learned and that the uh the dangers would be lessened not increased going forward if you're just joining us we're talking to an Tony ...\nAnd her about her latest Pacific Standard cover story it's called death on the Dakota access\nThis is the pipeline that hit all of the headlines um where Native American tribes attempted to stop the construction on this twelve hundred mile pipeline\nUnsuccessfully as recently as last week when construction workers um were forced to stop by an\nActivist who were trying to kayak up to the work sites and\nDangle from trees and make a platforms to just stop the clear cutting for this thing but it appears to be to to no avail or is there any\nUh help for the workers who are actually facing dangerous circumstances eight six six seven eight eight to five five is the number if you have questions were Antonio so\nAgain this describe this pipeline that carries about more than a half million barrels of oil a day but it originates where and it goes where and it ends up\nHe's of pipelines that begins in North Dakota and it starts in the upper\nA tip of the of of North Dakota\nTraveling across most of the state it originates their Stanley North Dakota travels across the state than cuts into South Dakota than Iowa than Illinois\nAnd that pipeline is called the Dakota access pipeline it connects in Illinois with another pipeline called energy transfer crude oil pipeline or at co\nWhich then carries that oil to Texas from Texas\nThat pipeline is now there's one leg that still being built and that's what you were just referencing and that's the bayou bridge pipeline so what the bayou bridge pipeline does is where\nThe Dakota access pipeline combined with ... which is combined called the Bach and pipeline\nCarries that oil from North Dakota Texas the reason for carrying that oil from North Dakota to Texas is to export it that's the reason why where's it going it's going wherever the company's wished to send it it's also being refined they're\nInto gasoline and other products but increasingly into petrochemical products that have to be what's called both oil but even more so natural gas um our crack\nComponents that are uh then become the inputs into plastics and making plastics it's a lot of this is about increasing the plastics market\nBut back to this pipeline so this pipeline goes to Texas and to export this is oil primarily to export it out out of the United states then the bayou bridge pipeline what you just referenced is just as extra leg that cuts across this beautiful by you system and Louisiana\nHe should have been there's no question that he should have been sent home based on the interviews with people who were present at the time but uh you know time is money and he was kept on the job and he also died on the job now these this um\nThis checkerboard of companies\nMeans there's also a very difficult to know\nIf there were other deaths that happened I don't know under construction of the Dakota access pipeline it's possible that there were but there isn't enough public publicly accessible information to know for certain I also only know about injuries on the job and only one of the states\nBecause that's because North Dakota is the only state that public he publicly makes available this worker injury\nData associated with a particular job site so I Know that there were eleven workers who were injured on the job but I don't know there's no way to know\nIf there were other injuries and the other states which it passes you think that's on purpose oh for sure for sure to make it much more difficult to know deaths and injuries and that's also been made more difficult under the Trump Administration which has limited\nAnd restricted publicly available and reported data on injuries and fatalities of workers so while I was in the course of writing this article the information that I needed\nWas in some ways of disappearing from these public Web sites because I'm\nThe data that needed to be made available was being limited that I needed was being limited by the Trump Administration but what I then found after I identified these to death\nI then found as I mentioned earlier\nThat the bureau of Labor Statistics has not been presenting fatality rate data for the industry the with their guidance\nAnd with their help and trying to mimic as close as possible the way that they create fatality rate data I used publicly available data bureau of Labor Statistics data to create my own fatality rate and I found that just like oil and gas production\nThe building of oil and natural gas pipelines is among one of the deadliest jobs in the country\nIn fact you found something like three point six times more deadly than the average American workers job\nThat's right in two thousand and sixteen um but ... but that these ... tally rate reached highs of seven times the national average twice since since two thousand and three which is when the bureau of Labor Statistics only began providing\nThe numbers of workers who have died while in this job sector and that that seven that they tell the rate of seven times the average American worker is consistent also for oil and gas production which is also it turns out into the deadliest jobs\nIn America so producing the oil and natural gas and building the pipeline to carry it are among the deadliest jobs are in the nation\nWere you surprised by that but it's not just the the offshore drilling which we you know pick your being out in the middle of the ocean and and subject to the elements and and all kinds of other dangers so to what extent were you surprised that the actual pipeline construction itself is is so deadly\nYeah I think both for the onshore production and the pipelines I was very surprised at how Heidi said tell the rates were particularly because you know even as someone who spends a lot of my time investigating\nThat go wrong in this industry we all still live with in this um\nYou know sort of general understanding created by the oil and gas industries that day because they are so wealthy because they are so advanced\nThat they are you know spending every available dollars that they can to make their work sites as safe as possible and of course that's what energy transfer partners said when we saw um input from them in ...\nScary dangerous work sites is what one finds out and they are extremely lacking inappropriate regulatory oversight in some cases almost no regulatory oversight at all\nAnd they are extremely dangerous for their workers and extremely dangerous for uh the communities through which they pass and to me that was\nVery very surprising isn't even as someone who spent so much time studying what goes wrong um and that these dangers have increased for a number of reasons um\n[noise] one being a well it might be too much to go into the time that we have it's increase for a number of reasons including um because of the Trump Administration and even for additional push of deregulation that's happened but problems existed even before the Trump Administration came in and so you were taking what was already a dangerous\nJob and just making it even more dangerous\nUm as a result of this in the new administration so one of the things that happened for example on the Dakota access pipeline\nIs that prior to Nicholas John and such as death\nThe um OSHA office the occupational safety and Health Administration office in North Dakota had not visited a single work site along the Dakota access pipeline\nThat at all at all you know entire six months of its construction prior to his death why they weren't responsible for the oversight or it was an oversight on their part or why wouldn't they have is that it not once\nSo what's what's odd about oil and natural gas is it even though this is one of the deadliest job sectors in the country and even though it's considered part of the mining sector by the federal government it's not regulated in the same ways that the mining sector is it is\nUnder lesser regulatory standards and it's considered a quote unquote low hazard industry so that it faces lesser regulation and things like coal mining or other types of mining of which which is technically apart instead it's under the OSHA act\nUm which doesn't require mandatory job site inspections and OSHA is a tragically underfunded agency so in the entire state of North Dakota there are only eight OSHA\nInspectors for every single job site in the entire state so whether that's a grocery store or a factory or an oil pipeline there's only eight inspectors\nWent out of I just find that shock I agree you were shocked to but I mean that just seems impossible and that's what the F. L. C. A. O. estimate is that it would take one hundred years for each job site in North Dakota to be visited just once\nIn a in one hundred years by OSHA and that's typical across the country so um you have not enough inspectors you also have\nAreas of oil and gas and because of oil industry lobbying are are\nUm exempt from a number of requirements of oversight and regulation and then you have on top of that the Trump Administration coming in and rolling back regulations that had been tried to be put in place by the Obama administration\nAnd you have a budget that for example right now for the entire OSHA budget it's what it was in two thousand and ten\nAnd basically since Nineteen Seventy one OSHA was created it hasn't been\nA significant hasn't seen its budget significantly increased anyway\nAnd then now that budget is under attack 'em by the Trump Administration as well as a hiring freeze and then retirements that happened with a lot of people wanting to leave when the Trump Administration came into office I'm with a decline in investigators a decline in managers across the board across the country well\nBoth the workers that you profile ... Dolan were represented they were members of the uh\nThe pipeline workers including about eleven hundred of the Dakota access pipeline workers so why is the uh construction so fatal and I'm ... who's looking out for these workers and making sure that they're being taken care of\n'em is what you describe is happening who's looking out for the workers\nYou know you bring up a really important point which is one of the reasons why these this job these work uh these jobs are so dangerous\nIs how low of union representation they have\nSo oil and gas production is almost entirely non unionized are almost no unions at all representing oil and gas production workers the pipelines are somewhat more unionized um estimates of the amount of hard to come by maybe thirty percent\nAnd that's because unions like the labor's and I'm like international lane of North America you know which you mentioned\nUm these are unions that represent workers in otherwise traditionally more unionized sectors like construction these are laborers and they are constructing a pipeline so essentially where oil and gas work\nOverlaps with other sectors you see you some unionization so for example refinery workers or maybe about fifty percent potentially I'm represented by unions because they overlap with the United steelworkers unions the pipeline workers are somewhat represented because they overlap with construction work\nI'm On these union job sites and I I research this state holidays are about half\nOf our oil and gas pipeline construction on union representative job sites the non union represented workers and so\nDakota Access pipeline and I didn't have the the capacity to look at all pipelines in the U. S. um may in fact be unique that there were only two deaths because it was a union job site there were union ah companies the these these workers are represented by unions\nUm and and the job sites for union job sites that said um the unions only have so much influence obviously in this day and age and their influence is being is is quite under attack\nSo that also means that what they are able to push for each day is limited because they have so many obstacles that they're trying to overcome and less influence obviously than they have had in the past", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
