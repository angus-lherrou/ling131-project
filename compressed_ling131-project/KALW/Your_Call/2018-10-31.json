five point two billion dollars making it the most expensive midterm ever [noise]\nThose funds are being spent by candidates political parties packs superPACs and nonprofits around the country\nDemocrats are either outspending are keeping up with Republicans and competitive races even in conservative areas\nSo where is all of the money coming from and how is it being spent today we're joined by Sheila Krumholz executive director of the center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks the effects of money and lobbying on elections and public policy Hi Sheila welcome to the show\nHi thanks for having me\nThank you for joining us we're also joined by Paul Blumenthal a reporter at the Huffington Post Paul's work has appeared on PBS Frontline and MSNBC he previously worked as a senior writer for the Sunlight Foundation and they also do an incredible job of following the money Hi Paul welcome back thank you for joining us\nVery much for every meal [noise]\nGreat to have you on well Sheila I Want to start off with you you're the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics and you all do such a fantastic job of following the money I think two months ago I saw a report that said three point two billion so when we were doing research for the show\nI was kind of shocked that it's now five point two billion I mean every election it's just getting worse the money just continues to flow into these campaigns\nIt does and each cycle we are getting tired of saying we're it's another record breaking\nA cycle for spending but this cycle is really different we're seeing a much larger leap from one mid term to the next ah so three point eight million was spent in two thousand fourteen so to project a five point two billion\nA projected total costs for the cycles is truly astonishing and we think that that five point two billion his conservative so it may in fact go north of that [noise]\nWell since you've been following the money for so long what really strikes you about this mid term and the five point two billion that were expected will be spent on that all of this\nWell the numbers that leap out at us are the fundraising for house candidates in particular a so already ah this cycle we have seen\nA spending for house candidates ah near one point three billion dollars for this is just through the ah ah let's see October seventeenth I'm\nOctober Fifteen through the pre general reports and this is favoring Democrats uh\nBy quite a bit the cycle as compared to last so democratic advantage particularly in the house\nAnd a a winnowing of money spent by the party committees the kind of traditional party committees are declining and the outside spending\nCommittees the superPACs and nonprofits are really becoming more and more of a substantial extension of the\nPast party machinery\nAnd Paul what really strikes you you recently wrote a piece called dark money groups will have to disclose their donors and time for the midterms\nAnd Bloomberg wrote an op ed about his decisions and he said that in the last election\nHe spent ten million dollars to help elect Pat Toomey a Republican in Pennsylvania He says I disagree with him on many issues but I support that he broke with the n._r._a. and co wrote a bipartisan bill to close the background check loophole\nAnd so this time he says he's supporting all Democrats even though he disagrees with them on various issues but he's\nHe doesn't get very a specific on this you know I mean I think that people can't stand about the system is that this one man\nI'm has so much power thirty eight million and then Thomas dire fifty one million Sheldon and marry him um adults and big time Republicans are going to spend the most about a hundred and Thirteen million on Republicans that we'll talk about them in a minute but Paul do you know what kind of Democrats as Michael Bloomberg supporting\nI mean I think that he is supporting you know Democrats in close races across the board\nAh we we I mean we do know that his political preferences towards more centrist Democrats or more you know people\nPeople that are less progressive than uh you know a maybe a lot of the candidates that he's supporting in in this election\nUm but I mean you know as he mentioned ... people are upset about the ability of people who have tens of billions of dollars of their own personal will to spend you know a hundred million dollars on elections into them that's like\nCutting a you know like me cutting out one hundred dollar check or something or you know ... it's a drop in the bucket and I mean it it's it's clearly a problem and the sort of second gilded age that we're living through that we have you know someone like\nJeff Bezos Sheldon Adelson or Mike Bloomberg\nShould the drop\n[noise] yeah it's like a percentage of the tax cuts that they got I mean that's what's so incredible and frustrating about the amount of money that's being spent\nProblem and saw as a reporter with the Huffington Post and he writes extensively about these issues Sheila Krumholz is executive director of the center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks the effects of money and lobbying on elections and public policy\nAnd today we're talking about money in politics the center for Responsive Politics projects that total spending on next week's elections will reach a whopping five point two billion dollars making it the most expensive midterm ever\nAnd the Democrats have caught up in other elections they haven't raised as much as Republicans but this time they are raising as much\nSo what questions do you have about money in politics it just seems that this this issue is getting worse and later on the show we will talk about efforts to take money out of politics the toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five you can also email\nYour call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nSo we talked about Michael Bloomberg spending about thirty eight million to support Democrats Tom stiers fifty one million to Democrats\nAre the biggest spenders so far this cycle are Sheldon and Miriam Adelson the casino billionaires there shelling out more than a hundred and Thirteen million to support Republican candidates we just did a show about them last week and there's a great piece and I believe it was ProPublica about how\nSheldon Adelson calls tromp on a regular basis and his number one polish policy is Israel and so far he's getting just about everything he wants on that issue I'm Sheila what really stood out for you when you all did research on the money that the adult sons are spending\nWell the Adelson have ah\nAs you say a longtime interest in promoting a pro Israel policy in the U. S.\nUh but he also gives in ways that are uh of course he and near him give in ways that are\nA beneficial to his a significant stakes in a gaming a with a casino operations across the globe a and he's been a longtime donor I Do think ah for adults and the um\nYou can't separate the two but the\nUh pro Israel policy is probably a more prominent um\nPiece of his uh his um a\nKind of philosophy that's driving his giving 'em\nBut ... so it's a money that is going a in a most of it is going to these outside groups\nBecause they can take unlimited sums that he can give a millions of dollars a pop a and he's also giving you know on down the line to to party committees as well\nUm yeah so there's you know he's as with many donors we can do what motivates any single donation but he has multiple interests and a lot of interests uh before the federal government\nAnd Paul what would you add on Sheldon Adelson and the money he's spending\nI mean I think if you you you had to show up is already you're pro recovered or what's going to bring up the ProPublica article or believe bird ... no ...\nBut you know talks about her Adelson has gotten pretty much everything he bought the you know he supports the far right wing government of Israel and you know he got uh\nThe Trump Administration centrally has given up any even like the the pretense of\nA ... of working with the Palestinians in any way shape or form a you know Sheldon Adelson has said the Palestinians do not exist so I mean that is how the\nTrump Administration has treated them or as well uh I Believe the ProPublica piece touched on the fact that Trump is advocated to the Japanese president ...\nThat they should pass a bill to allow gambling in the country and that that bill should benefit Sheldon Adelson scam gambling company um which is you know\nThat sort of that that this is the kind of stuff that this money but I Do a in these elections and if the Republicans somehow managed to hold the house this election I think that they have to think\nNumber one children and Miriam Adelson for contributing over a hundred million dollars to to their effort even though while they're being out funded in other areas by the Democrats\n[noise] this piece by just in LA and it really is a mastery and it's called ... in chief casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has never been more powerful and he's got he takes phone calls with Trump and has such an influence on the administration I Hope you can read that\nAdelson is getting a lot of attention and the Koch brothers Paul what role as a plane in this election\nI mean it's a very good question and a ... from what I can tell they are still politically active probably more so at the state and local level and on ballot initiatives but they've really taken a step back a in this a Trump era you know\nThey didn't particularly love Donald Trump or he didn't really align with their view of the future of conservatism and libertarianism and and so they've\nThey've somewhat stepped back but they're certainly out they're supporting governors that they like like Scott Walker in Wisconsin or Doug duty in Arizona and you know they're fighting ballot initiatives that attack the oil and gas industry\nYou know that seek to sample is climate change regulations or in places like north and South Dakota they are running campaigns against a ballot initiative that would\nCreate new bodies of ethics laws and campaign finance reform that would reveal dark money in those states so I mean there are still active but it is it a much lower level than it was in twenty twelve twenty fourteen and even in in the twenty sixteen election\nThat the Associated Press reports that Charles and David Koch are planning to spend about four hundred million on the many times does that sound right to you\nI mean I'd ... from what I can tell from their organizations they are not spending that much I think that those reports also or you know they may have been counting money that would go in to spending on\nTheir political projects in general that aren't necessarily the elections so they are still putting a lot of money into funding programs that universities to try to advance their or on their beliefs of what economic should say and do and how it should be taught by\nYou know funding schools at George Mason and Florida Atlantic University and other other places like that\nOkay yeah because the New York times as a piece and Charles Koch takes on Trump's chump takes on Charles ... and they report that they are planning to spend four hundred million on politics and policy so they're spending a lot of money to try to get people convinced that the tax cut benefits every\nOn it because it really did really just go to the ... the ... the very wealthy and Sheila in your reporting on this time around it anything stand out for you when it comes to the Koch brothers and what they're spending\nLess plus says there are so their activities and their money is so diverse of either they're investing in so many ways and I think he does the critical thing to remember for them as they have so much money and they haven't been investing hundreds of millions of dollars over so many years now that uh\nBenefits because of it ah I have not heard that they are gaining similar attraction with small donors ah that\nI'm Gillum and Abrams might um but but there is no uh nothing to prevent a donor's across the country from giving a small donations certainly and in some cases very large donations to candidates that have nothing to do with their state or district\nThe critical thing though about outside money rather out of state money is that that represents money yes and that's important for any campaign\nBut it does not represent votes and that can be a pretty rude awakening on election day when the candidates like Jon Ossoff speaking of Georgia who has raised a the most money in their campaign uh from donors across the country\nHad not gathered enough support from those who were actually able to cast a vote for him on election day\nI mean it's just amazing when you look at these numbers so in Georgia where Democrats Stacey Abrams is running against Republican Brian Kemp another race that so many people are watching because she could become the first black governor in the country the first black governor ever ... that's about fifty six million dollars\nThen here in California you got Gavin Newsom who according to the LA Times latest numbers a whopping ... three million dollars\nWhat is this money being spent is not another can it can be tracked Sheila like how much do they spend on TV ads how much are the consultants making\nI mean there was a lot of criticism of how the Democrats that their money and that presidential election they spent so much money on expensive consultants in some states rather than on the ground grassroots organizing so is there any way to track the money and find out how it's being spent\nI yes uh I'm I'm less than a million or with\nUh what they've been doing on expenditures but the national Institute on money in politics that followed the money dot org does track money in state elections a for all fifty states um but my sense at a at the kind of\nMost broad level is that\nThe mirrors the kind of patterns of spending at the federal level which is in the earliest a month's uh and even off election year of a campaign\nThat candidates are generally are investing in operations and overhead and salaries administration setting up their field operations and and getting organized as well as of course fundraising which continues throughout the entire\nElection cycle but then as\nThe days are towards ... closer to where the election the spending shift to media and so we're certainly seeing at that at the national level a this cycle\nA whereby um the spending on media has already out pays spending um\nThere is creeping up on the total cost us than a standing on media from the last midterm election cycle is nearing a billion dollars\nA year and so we're seeing that shift from kind of getting organized to now focusing on messaging a much of which is much more of which is being invested on line in the most competitive races TV\nIs still critical and millions will be invested their but we're seeing growth in spending online are already on\nFacebook a political ads on Facebook a total more than two hundred and fifty six million dollars just from the period may through October\nSo famous cook and other online\nPlatforms are getting an increasing\nShare of the pie but Paul I don't know if you have other resources for expenditures focusing on categories of expenditures at the state level\nI'm so I'm not a hundred percent sure in the state level I mean I presume the\nCandidate continue to spend like they they like the federal ones do on on television that I mean the the the twenty eighth team election is\nYou know breaking the record for the amount of money being spent on television advertising as as you would expect I mean most Americans still get their news from television ah you know that's why\nPeople like to watch TV or every night after work it's a very popular hobby I guess you could call it um and that's one of the better ways to reach voters and we've seen\nYou know more spending on television this election than in previous elections there's about a similar amount of negative advertising at the federal level as there was in previous elections but in total volume there's more television advertising and you know that might be\nViewed as a bad thing but we're\nYou know one of the reasons behind that is that there are more candidates running and more races that are more competitive races than ever before I mean we're talking about\nHouse races right now Democrats are fielding candidates in every single house district something they've never done before at least not in the modern political era uh and and so you know a lot of those candidates are raising\nFar more money than they should be based on the uh competitive level of their election and so they're spending their money a lot you know to what one way to reach voters\nThrough television advertising um I'm not I'm not so sure about how much is being spent on field operations which are usually done in tandem with their political party are especially if the party determined that the Kennedy has a decent shot of winning\nBut I mean that's sort of the worst six days out from the election we're in the phase where most of the money is going towards the vote operation you know last minute contacts\nDoor knocking a block walking and any kind of mailings and TV ads that Mike complement that kind of get a vote for a and I presume that's what it would have smart\nState level candidate is going to be spending their money ...\n... ... is a reporter with the Huffington Post and Sheila Krumholz is executive director of the center for Responsive Politics they project the total spending on next week's elections will reach five point two billion dollars once again breaking records if you have any questions for ... or ... about money in politics\nI mean what are your thoughts about this we we do shows about money in politics regularly and we're always sane once again a record has been broken but this time around the Democrats have reached parity with Republicans usually Republicans\nRaise more money from massive massive donors so what are your thoughts on this or the Democrats tend to raise more money from small donors but this time around they are getting millions from Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer and on the Republican side at Sheldon Adelson the toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nYou can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nAnd if you have any questions or comments about money in politics if you're working on a campaign to take money out of politics or if you have an example of maybe you've lived in another country where this just doesn't happen\nWe'd love to hear from you and let's talk about what's happening in Texas that has been fascinating to watch\nThe Dallas News just came out with a story the title is Beto O'Rourke has raised twice as much cash as Ted Cruz\nAnd his bed to unseat Ted Cruz and the Senate\nBeto O'Rourke who's an El Paso congressmen this is incredible he has raised more than Seventy million dollars more than any other Senate candidate in history and last night he was on MSNBC doing a town hall\nAt the University of Houston He has just gotten a ton of media attention I'm more than forty six percent of federal ... money is coming from individual contributions of less than two hundred dollars\nHe is not taking any pac money Paul what stands out for you about all of this money that Beto O'Rourke has raised\nI mean the thing with them do the most is is the the small donor contributions\nHe's raised I Believe thirty one million dollars\nOr in contributions under two hundred dollars or\nSo so I mean he really has just a huge amount of support is really caught fire especially nationally um so I guess you know we talked about a Sheila talked about you know John also running in Georgia and raising a ton of national small dollar money and then losing the election\nUm you know I think even if\nBetter or loses this election by only a few points\nA generally viewed as a democratic\nState um you know in a lot of ways that this money depending on how it's been could really transformed the future of the Democratic party in Texas by by being spent to register voters get them up to the polls and make them\nYou know more regular a part of the electoral process Texas is one of the worst voter turnouts\nIn the country are you know maybe even behind California and a lot of that is is due to low voter turnout among Latinos and other\nUh you know democratic leaning groups um and you know from from what I gather and read the ... campaign and spending a lot of its time and money on getting these people are voting early voting numbers in Texas are already showing explosive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "31"}
