journalism on that I recently wrote and produced traffic in America\nA must see documentary exposing the government's role in the labor trafficking of Guatemala and teenagers at an egg farm in Ohio and you can watch that on line and find a link at your call radio dot org and ... joined us in Studio ... good to have you back ... thank you for coming in\nWell because so many media outlets including ours was focused on a Brett Kavanaugh last week we really want us to do the show to get an update so let's just go over some basics\nIn late June a federal judge ordered the government to reunite more than twenty five hundred at children who were taken from their parents at the border\nIn September various advocacy groups estimated more than four hundred children were still separated from their parents and last week the Washington Post reported that one hundred of those children remain in custody Oscar what are the final numbers and how do we know\nWhere we are very hard to ... grade be below ... be because the number ... changing partly because it is kind of a moving target for Bush I'm giving mind goes ... but we are being more familiar with our number ... basically we're generator\nAre the crisis going forward are beginning in June but in reality the keeping mine got their practice ... children from ... in front of the country without there'll be a cross actually being happening for a long time just last week the guardian newspaper from number for Britain\nOver this number ... on the show because you reminded us feel good artist ... merely for being though some cute mind orders were actually have not are you able to be separated we'd better buttons\nOr the I mean the policy was a I think I'm based on the the public's reaction and the government changing course it was a I think the reaction was overwhelming that this this was inhumane the way that children were being separated from their families\nI think when when a subtle point to make that I think is a a going back to the floor is agreement to understand also why this was happening is there was an effort\nA earlier understanding that children do not belong in detention and this is where the floors agreement comes into the fact that a CBP a border patrol cannot detain the kids for more than Seventy two hours\nThe idea is that the images that we've seen of the the chain link fences and the kids being held in these cells\nOr that they shouldn't be there for more than Seventy two hours that should be transition until they can be released to a shelter so it's under that idea that hey these are kids we can't keep them in um in jail in a in a detention center that's what led that was the underlying uh factor that led to separating from them from their parents\nNow there are also family detention centers where now families are going where children are not supposed to be there for longer than twenty days\nThat is now being challenged because the government to start is starting to say well we we want to be able to keep them there basically they're doing everything they can to undo or with the administration has a called the catch and release systems in which people who come to this country present themselves as asylum seekers\nOr are given a court date and are released into the public to come back later at a later date to present their case this was being called catch and release were just let him go they're not presenting themselves later which isn't necessarily true a lot of them work\nUm but the Trump Administration said we're not going to do that we want to hold\nUm [noise] after the whole family separation crisis is kind of died down what we have is the government challenging a the the the current ah establish rules and trying to keep families and attention longer\n... is a documentary filmmaker and professor of visual journalism at the UC Berkeley school of journalism he recently wrote and produced trafficked in America\nA documentary exposing the U.S government's role in the labor trafficking of Guatemalan teenagers and Ohio egg farm can people still watch that at the front line website\nYet that's on uh PBS rent one was\nLike okay great we had on ... on a couple of months ago to talk about it is such an important documentary I Hope you can watch it we're\nAlso joined by Oscar ... co founder and executive director of ... America's and umbrella of immigrant lead and immigrants serving organizations and on today's your call we are talking about\nWhat is happening with family separations during that quote zero tolerance crackdown at the U.S border if you have any questions\nIf you'd like to get an update on the latest we'd love to hear from you eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nIf you work with an organization that is trying to reunite families what are the obstacles how are you going about it especially when we're talking about kids who have not been identified at all no bracelet no photo no fingerprint\nAnd if you have experienced or you're in the process of seeking asylum or you know someone who is in that process and he'd like to share a story give us a call eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nAnd if you know anyone who's been directly affected by family separation you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nSo this is a damning report that came from an internal watchdog with in the department of homeland security Andre she just reading about this report\nWe're kind of surprised that so much information came out of this who was behind this\nWell as you said this was an internal watchdog that went to a ... as\nThe crisis was unfolding they did a unannounced visit to some of these ports of entry to find out what was going on in what they found out was some of the things that the the reporters were finding out that there wasn't really a plan that even though they were saying there was a database there was a really a database or the other major findings included\nA the fact that uh parents were being given a different information about whether they were going to be able to stay with their kids are not so some people were misinformed about what they were doing and didn't realize that they were going to be signing the papers saying that the children were going to be taken away from them\nSo it was inconsistent information given to parents at the time or the other of finding that they found was as um\nThe we're uh at the ports of entry where people this is a place where you know you cross the border or there's a foot bridge are going to go to a CBP station and get process and you can make an asylum claim a that there were\nA long lines that were a forming their as people were being encouraged to goats go through the front door so to speak as opposed to crossing illegally and as these lines got longer and longer people were being discouraged from open a going in the front door and then those people ended up crossing illegally and then getting\nA detained I'm so there was a backups at every level there was inconsistent misinformation and there was no central database to keep track of a sandwich and the kids\nOscar what else really stood out for you in this report\nWhen someone does the word ... rode out to me for some or you know a lot of men have being negative or Iraq that are on a or a garden\nThey really want way\nShe would have to be treated you know when they face up what they have the ...\nAnd and that is one aspect of this rotifer agree man but I Believe needs to be men's from again grease on why that particular law for ... in the ... or maybe this is before there were plenty or before from Central America\n... and what their ... of the time arriving through your risk it very often and they would do the math because of you being denied the right to apply for me to find them and once they live there were these them because it denies bullied because ...\nEven though ... both of these countries where ... was documents if you're not far to go\nIs the ... and ... year we are thirty or four years after the war and we're not interested Grisham him button in the in the end I'm buddies really happening we are denying be for water fleeing condition for humans\nBut the verb your money by the imperfect from not just the kids or for a bit of pardon and in doing so you know in basically in treating you can hold in the longer than they should be held instead of going sponsored by a ... of course you don't wear them you'll be ... miles from us but we have\nWe got or all kinds of motor my legs in the idea that it is okay enough of these things before and it is a Sunday\nNo sure we'll hear these when we learn that'd be done some parts of the week before the ... being held I'd actually private in Iran and the company's behind them out of making money out of\nRight and let's talk about that we we've done a lot of shows about this so this is ... is that where the kids we're only supposed to stay for Seventy two hours\nAccording to this internal report one child was confined for twelve days another for twenty five\nMany of these children were put in chain link holding hands and the Rio Grande valley of southern Texas where there are no beds and no showers the inspector general also made a surprise inspection of California immigration detention facility and found new says hanging in the cells\nAnd delayed medical care and this is a privately run ice detention facility at least seven suicide attempts have occurred facility\nAnd then the PBS NewsHour recently reported on a three year old girl who was just reunited with her family after seven weeks of detention and when she came back\nShe talked about being punished for crying too much or not eating enough food or not eating her food and she made references to medicine and she was given at the shelter\nAnd reveal earlier this year reporting on a lawsuit against a center housing immigrant kids in which families say that they were forced to take pills or they were injected with medications that made them dizzy lists lesser even kept incapacitated I mean and then there's the the reports of sexual assault\nI mean I mean what's what's what's going on here in this isn't to make an excuse for for anybody\nA but there is no system in place that can handle the amount of people that are coming over in the government is a is contracting out there they're outsourcing uh the the government shelters are full um and this backlog\nIs creating issues all the way down so for instance um the border patrols a response to the to the the watchdog report\nAbout children being held longer than seven to two hours is that you have that did happen sometimes because we were supposed to hand them over to health and Human Services are but they were so backlog that we didn't have anywhere to put them\nIt seems to be true because there are full to capacity\nSo I'm going back to two thousand fourteen uh when we saw the surge of on a company miners when a sixty Seventy thousand kids were coming\nUm and this was the time of the reporting that we did is there were so many kids coming does use of health and Human Services\nAnd then he's ... he's the one you're lucky if you've seen the link toward giving mom or about ... order that child may well be regarded legally speaking as a child with no guard down with no prior to him\nIn about ... may well be given the option and again I mean if you only see the ... the idea of going to be showing that one kid like that make going to be caught somebody other than ...\nWhy don't they argue if he's going to have a better life and they're about to buy a given American market or father\nBut again the the hotter breaking event and that the grace of the moment they were separated things going on outside in the north and then he started for something to be said I have worked for the for button especially against the hunger\nWhere did they in the end feed him so incredibly busy heartbroken that day a point of saying look you know I I Know I may never in my view that again the only place I find from hook you to know that they may be able to have a better life than like would offer them if they had been with us\nBut again I mean if you think about the ... he says just wouldn't be liberal or whatever it is one other thing with the wants to bring up I mean we'd gone every every in these big mocked about why do you\nNo there is already out where more per recorded it started seeing going back to your friend before it being a male rarely focuses\nOn water are because of this or that are driving people to leave and and yes you know poverty here for like the common denominator to ... for the Bush if I mean people are for better or for very great condition for a perfect you some of ...\nBut at a strict in their life for people who may be hard decision to leave him face potentially I said part is Ron from the ...\nYeah I just wanted to ... one thing that was said a a particularly a cruel aspect of this whole process was that the\nParents who Bronx or children with them and then we're them separated their children were doing categorized as unaccompanied because there were no longer with their parents so then they were put into the system for unaccompanied minors is is to have come here on their own when they come here with their parents\nFor [noise]\n... it's a documentary filmmaker I Hope you can check out his latest film trafficked in America you can watch that on line we're also joined by
