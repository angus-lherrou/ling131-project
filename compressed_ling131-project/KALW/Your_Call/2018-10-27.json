protests by University of Wisconsin students\nTo the students peaceful sit in against Dow Chemical in Nineteen sixty seven that turned violent the film does an incredible job of showing the power of

and broadcast journalist who has produced Ninety prime time news magazine stories for various CBS News an ABC News broadcast\nAs well as ten independent documentaries primarily for PBS\nGlenn Silber

welcome to the show how are you ... it's great to have you\nOh at such a critical time in this country because it just watching the film I just kept thinking about media coverage of all of these more is that the U.S is involved in today\nWell it's been very different because in Vietnam of course that became the TV were and that was a huge factor of stoking the anti war movement back home\nAnd then you flash forward to Iraq where everyone all of a sudden is imbedded right I was at ABC News and I declined to the offer to be imbedded that wasn't the way I Do business and I thought that was bullshit frankly\nWhat happened when he declined the offer\nOh it's a longer story they just put out they they put out a memo at twenty twenty where I was working that asking people if they wanted to get what they called special media training and they explained that meant it would be if you would sided to go over there how you might survive if you were captured\nAnd you know I got a call from a senior producer 'cause I was considered at that point I think maybe the most serious producer on twenty twenty there was always trying to do kind of aggressive things they thought I'd want to go\nBut of course I had two kids in college and I'd been down to El Salvador and I'd done things like that and the whole thing I was so against the war in Iraq for months and months I was actually making not friends by being so outspoken about it I thought it was bullshit from the beginning part of my be\nBut um anyway so I just didn't want any part of it ah I wound up doing some important work around the investigation and tonight eleven with John Miller and we were the ones who broke the story where the terrorists have been living in Paterson New Jersey\nAnd you know I felt like I Do plenty of good things on the ground back home I didn't have to go over there and be imbedded\n[noise] that that was really big one that came out is that still happening to you know I don't hear about in bed report\nWell forget the ramp up to him is so ridiculous to ramp up to the war in Iraq with this whole question of weapons of mass destruction and signaling to everyone over there that there's gonna be a shock and awe in a month or whatever it was\nThe only thing was strange and I just thought it was an incredible disaster and I could see it like a train wreck and so I didn't want to do it\nCalled the most dangerous man in America which I just love that's on Saturday evening and then lastly or another friend of mine ... field who made the film the life and times of Rosie the riveter and other other really great films she's going to be there on Sunday at four pm show I Love being able to have this dialogue with the audience afterwards and it's been\nIncredibly moving just to see people who haven't seen the film and thirty eight years or some young person who has never seen the film that is what we're really trying to figure out how to get the film it's time for us old guys like me to pass the torch\nBut to me this is like I said this is my contribution to the resistance to put this film back out there to look at how do you build a seven eight year resistance campaign what does that take when you're up against presidents like Lyndon Baines Johnson\nAnd war mongering presidents like Richard Nixon who don't even care remember when the film there's a guy says after the moratorium one of the few times we do go outside at Madison\nThe guy says well you could have two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand people protest then you hear that Nixon was watching the football game ha ha\nThat's going to lead the frustration so all these the texture of this whole movement from start to finish you keep seeing the consciousness growing sheep seeing the resistance growing and it just charging ahead and not backing down\nSo I think the two types of ways of probably more is we've got to get organized gotta get informed you got to get organized and then you have to really decide if you're going to be which side are you are\nYou talking about and confident next and the choices they made out of thinking about an ad in the White House and you have these seminal events happening in the U.S and he got to play golf at mar a Lago ... look what's happening at that and then at\nIf you have any questions or comments for granted if you saw that with the war at home we'd like to hear from you if you'd like to ask glad I mean he's\nA long time journal asked when did you first start doing journalism\nWell at first I spent my first twelve years as an independent filmmaker making films like the war at home in El Salvador new set of Vietnam and you know my wife and I made the film on the San Francisco my trip here which is a fabulous film called troopers award winning film\nBecause we really was always in a way back then when I was still in my twenties early thirties I sort of looked at the mind troupe is doing what I was trying to do\nThey do it with theater I was trying to do with film which is create a radical culture and tell the truth and use a different form in this case they're very entertaining\nTo to capture people's attention\nAnd we just love that year we had so much fun and uh so there were other films and then it turned out my wife was pregnant the entire year we've made troopers so that was kind of the end of the world and I got very lucky I stumbled into the back door of CBS News an ABC for twenty three years uh doing\nReally great work because what my problems as an independent which every independent will say\nMoney for production and then how do you distribute it so when I was working for this prime time shows\nProblem solved and every piece I Would do would be at least maybe five six seven eight million people would say it was like the equivalent of having a hit movie at that that was before the Internet for twenty four seven cable at least for the first ten years\nSo I've had this incredible varied career that I don't know anyone else has actually gone from being kind of this radical filmmaker brand which I embraced\nThe forget radical doesn't just mean like I was out there extremists it means we're getting\nI Love that you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot L. are edgy\nAnd we have a comment on Facebook from Steve says I saw the war at home in Nineteen eighty it was powerful and life changing then I think it's so important for people to see it now to get a perspective on taking direct action for social and political change good jobs there\nThank you Steve we also have an email from Tim my brother was sent to Vietnam made it home okay I'll never quite the same he recommended that I not go I went to Canada when I was sixteen and registered as a conscientious objector makes thanks to the Quakers who helped me do the paperwork\nMight number with two hundred and fifty three so I never had to go to jail difference was back then everyone except wealthy and bone spur folks were subject to the draft now due to Reaganomics it's only poor people who have no choice but to a giant ... volunteer army is\nWell he's certainly right I'm a lot of the people who have come from some of the more depressed areas you know they they are the ones who wind up out of necessity\nGoing into the military and it's hard you know the draft is more equitable but or the other hand we saw when you have an unjust war like Vietnam you know when I came to the University of Wisconsin in Nineteen sixty eight as a freshman I didn't know anything about the war and I grew up in a little bubble suburb of New Jersey\nAnd the first day after my parents brought me off at the University of they were so impressed with the campus and everything they said well you're going to a great education I did start in the next day when someone from the from the Wisconsin draft resistance union slipped\nA we put under my door my dorm room door come you know to the next door tomorrow evening and we're gonna have a meeting about the war in Vietnam I never forget this on top of the leaflet it said\nCollege disorientation [laughter]\nAnd when you went over there there was a hundred and fifty people in a room all freshmen most of whom didn't do much of anything about the war and that began the process that changed my life getting educated about something what is happening ten thousand miles away but that actually does affect me\nAnd so over time certainly my freshman and sophomore years you're participating because\nI was just one of many thousands of people kind of in the in the movement so to speak because I wanted to be participating because this did affect my life and we did feel a moral responsibility for what our government was doing\nIt seems like a novel idea these days but it was so important and I was so lucky to go to Madison was not guaranteed which way I Would go with college I Would go to it's almost like what are called chaos Syria where you wind up\nAnd I'm so that was really my education was not so much in the classroom and it was more in in the movement in the streets coming to terms with there's a line in the film where the Nineteen sixty five president of STDs talks about\nHow if the U.S when they were one of the leaders have built though they were very very small at that time\nYou said we we never tried to talk people into things we knew we were right we would take an action and force people to confront the situation and that's how you learned enough to make a decision says you're becoming a real grownup\n[laughter] well thank you so much for the email temp thanks for sharing that story at let's hear from bill who is making a documentary called the boys who said no high bell walking to the shell\nHello road thank you for having me on\nHigh bail did you have a lot in our comment\nI'll just say first hello to land and I personally will the award home to the evening and look forward very much the thing that and all sorts of things that question and answer I'm I Am part of a group or making another doctor\nUh about the draft resistance and the Vietnam Era or Glenn mentioned written gold now will be doing to an eight tomorrow night with Daniel Ellsberg over in Berkeley art director is Judah Arabic uh who co directed and\nCo produced a film about Ellsberg so we have a very\nClose a connection here um our film is not yet a finished\nA and instead of focusing on one particular place we focus on one particular group that arose as the war began a and as the war went on the group uh at first\nA tendency to burn draft cards which was extremely controversial and\nBitterly opposed by media and politicians but\nThey felt that that was not enough that after the draft card with birth everything went on a high as it had before\nNow were honest that break you had a question for Glenn about his film and about media coverage I force\nA you know I Apologize you and I communicated Brinkley about email or by email this morning and\nI don't we had my he let us know when your film is Dan and then have you on the shell thank you All right thank you for calling in and let's take another quick call before the break let's go to William and Belvedere Hi William\nYes thank you very much I I think that the gas made a mistake or when he said that um\nWhen the big march is the places they would hold that Nixon was watching a football games and that that was depressing um indeed people written biographies subsequently say that he was pulling out his hair\nOff from being upset about the enormous demonstrations so I think for me the lesson is when you want to do something to do it don't but don't be too dependent upon how the authority figures react\nThey of course they're going to say that what you should have no meaning\nBut if something's right to do it then do it\nThanks and you know I wanted to make a comment about that I I mean the public statement was he was watching a football game but you may be right in fact but one of the things that's come out recently we know that Lyndon Johnson was one of the most powerful presidents ever and he was really great domestically and really awful and Vietnam\nAnd in Nineteen sixty eight at the time when he was getting ready to announce that he wasn't going to run again there were five hundred and eighty five thousand troops\nIn Vietnam five hundred and eighty five thousand troops and then we learned two weeks ago from the great historian Michael Beschloss something we never knew before that Westmoreland not only wanted more troops we knew that but he secretly sent a memo to Johnson asking to move nuclear weapons into South Vietnam\nIt's just heartbreaking you know especially after eight years of a President Obama I heard something that Michael Moore said recently when he was ... showing his film you said you know where the bad situation now we have to figure out how to get out of it and right now it's all about the vote but then he said you know a lot of people got really ... you know embrace hope\nHope and he said you know as far as I'm concerned I Can't use a dirty word on T. V. but he said hope really sucks it's passive I went to the action\nWere not hoping for things we'd have to make it happen and I think that the similar our T between the war at home and Michael's recent film Fahrenheit eleven night is that they're both kind of fight back films we've got to fight back we got to do it not violently we can be militant leader violent\nBut we can't ever get involved with that kind of violence again at least as as from our side because it would just unleash or wherever repression and\nYou know it's I have to say it's refreshing talking to someone like you who is a long time reporter journalists filmmaker whose just say honest about what we're dealing last and I wonder as someone who is a long time channel after what do you think the role of journalism at today because I still get very frustrated with this so called manufactured balance\nAnd ... frame this story we're going to talk about an immigrant frame poverty and violence in a minute he's definitely finding that story\nWell I think I think the when Trump cut in and people were so shocked at first they were saying oh we're left with right now is the late night comics and the courts but\nPretty quickly at least the inside the beltway a core of investigative reporters started coming up with what's really going on\nAnd I think that's important it's not the kind of work I Do you know having sources that the state department or someplace else but I really feel like they have stepped up big time and we can be proud of what the fourth estate has done as far as investigating calling out following the Russia investigation to where it's going to go\nAs far as this sort of so called even handedness that's one of my really a arguments or that I feel even Ken Burns falls into that trap he feels he has to be overly cautious not to be like telling it like it is or you know and and that's just not my style I mean it's hard when I've worked at the networks successfully for Twenty years I loved it\nBecause the story was what came first they didn't think of it as a right wing story a left wing story it was just what's the story what's the facts let's tell it like it is if we hold people accountable and I've done that quite a few times\nYou know that's the role of journalism it's not to be the you know the PR group for one side or another and I feel empowered by that I Love my years there um\nBut I just think that we still have to keep our eye on the ball were not the enemy the state where the defenders of democracy\nAnd that's how it is called the first amendment thank you very much\n[noise] camera speaking with Glenn celebrating award winning filmmaker and longtime broadcast journalist who has worked for\nAn Academy Award for best feature documentary for El Salvador another Vietnam and the war at home which has a newly restored\nIt is opening across the country you can find information at your call radio dot org if you're in the bay area it's planet landmark upper plaza in San Francisco landmark ... in Berkeley and he'll be at tonight the screening that you'll be out isn't Assaf writes\nIt how about the ... and I was a seven Thirty years ago and then tomorrow I'll be there for the two twenty ... show and then I'll race across the bridge and go to Berkeley for the seven o'clock show with Daniel Ellsberg joining us onstage afterwards and then on Sunday at four pm or county field will be there helping me with the queuing it is\nAnd I just love coming here because I mentioned earlier we made the film or other ... San Francisco my troops some years ago and we just fell in love with the city and the whole spirit of the counter culture here is still I think that's still lives on\nYou know we want the culture war a long time ago starting in Nineteen sixty eight fifty years but you can draw the line from that sixty eight period and this is one of the things I like to talk about because I think it's missing in a narrative about resistance today\nWe young people built the political culture off the seat of our parents we don't always know what we're doing in the sixty eight late sixties early seventies and I think in a way we planted the seeds of resistance\nThat are happening today I don't know that you could have had the women's marches on that scale or come to that conclusion so quickly those massive massive largest had had we not had well we had in the late sixties early seventies\nI think even this amazing response by the from the tragedy in Parkland with the kids against gun violence you know I don't know that those high school kids would have even thought of this type of thing how do we not build that kind of political culture back in the sixties\nAnd of course the real legacy of the sixties is the women's movement and feminism and we're seeing how that's playing out now too so I think I'd like to have that conversation\nBecause that's why it's important for these teenagers in Parkland to see the word home is important for everyone not to get too depressed about the things were going on now because we've been in dark times dark political times before and so I'm really pumped up and I'm always ready to hit the barricades one way or the other\nI just feel toward home has a new role to play today\nIt's got an act too and I just hope people can make it down to the ... because that's where it has to start we're going old school they'll get to let people do the syllabus back\nOf course with a try our best to get back on college campuses I'm trying to set up a screening right now a free screening for Parkland, Florida students which will be fast it great yeah I'm On it but it's it's hard you know we don't have any funding we did a Kickstarter campaign we're out of money now and we're just doing it because it's the right thing to do\nLet's get another caller Ari on in San Francisco Hi Arianna blocking the show\nAnd taking my call I just want to say when we asked why do these war continue even though most of the Mac hurt them\nWe have to recognize that for us to have a change in our our Congress we need to change our own attitudes and I will have to give up our life how\nBecause most of these wars are based on hate ... courage and destroying culture that very vulnerable because we want the thing I Want and that and we get a\nFree pass to the Congress and we would be much healthier than create the culture in our culture where when I can keep on antidepressants\nIf he actually understood that product that is something that sharing and ... including lover people in Iran is talking about understanding instead of facing an actor I airliner a request economic disparity is a little bit Kay thank you\nOn thank you for that call today we're joined by Glenn silver who is an award winning filmmaker and long time at broadcast journalist\nHe's been twice nominated for an Academy Award for best feature for El Salvador another Vietnam and the war at home and you can find information about the newly restored the war at home and where it's plain across the country\nYour call radio dot O.
