Arabia\nA ... at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, Turkey and highly thank you for coming in fact you're having a great to have you well as we always do we first started off on a positive note by highlighting journalism that stood out this week so Lee let's start off with you what did you see this week they thought was done well\nThere's been so much quality coverage of I'm sure she saw guns in scandal um but\nIt's hard to highlight one piece um New York times has done a lot of great stuff Middle East\nI um but I Do want to highlight one particular piece but in a different topic um the New Yorker or had an article about the case against Harvard on affirmative action from want wash you are it's just a fascinating piece that peeled back or the\nPolitical history that went into this court case looking at the kind of political mobilization very kind of specific set of Chinese Americans of folks who are very recent immigrants who were very uh well educated well trained came as\nDoctors and engineers in the late eighties and early nineties who have mobilized around we chat the Chinese messaging app\nAnd how uh through a mixture of um [noise] a\nActual grievance and and victimization and actually a lot of fake news of um\nYou know complete conspiracy theories that they've mobilized into a very powerful force that could really reshaped the entire future of affirmative action in this country and it's really just a I think a very nuanced look at the in the entire wow a issue and you know the the trial started this week so it's very timely\nWow I hadn't heard that angle we we should do a show about this because and well where did you see this again this was in the New York I'm In New York are okay thank you we should do a show about that one because this is a really important case and we'll put a link to it at your car radio dot O. R. G. what about you ... what did you see this week that caught your attention\nClimbing I've been sort of you know a neck deep and this from officer of the story from here to stumble but I think this for a distraction um and I I thought it was just really fascinating and compelling\nUm I read the sort of New York times piece when he was yesterday that was a these are stories from a man talking about their\nI think the big problem with him as like obvious recklessness and just you know how unpredictable and unstable Middle East already is and then this guy and I'm Sorry I'm like you know pushing fifty\nSo I'm gonna call him like a kid um he comes in like sort of charging in 'em and it's just another really\nDangerous unstable factor\nIn this ... this this region you know um and and I think that no one really took that into account I mean I Try to you in the the stories that I did last year\nUm about ah the move she made\nA with regard to you know rounding up five hundred well family members escalating the war in Yemen um you know kidnapping the prime minister of Lebanon\nIf this sort of unpredictability this loose cannon uh attitude that he had with it which is really dangerous in a region where there is already you know\nA half a dozen countries launching airstrikes on half a dozen other countries and\nYou know a A R men being deployed by you know ... people all over the region of the last thing you needed was this sort of\nYoung you know reckless prince coming in and ... stuff up the\nJob I mean I Would I Would agree with that it's just that ah you know it's it's incredible that\nYou know ... none of these kind of unpredictable reflexes our instincts from NBS\nYou know they're not hidden we've seen them report it but it's ... ... you know it's it's hard to find mainstream outlets covering them in in in a critical way I mean this is just to see that the ... the change in in ten or ... the tone of mainstream coverage now as it was incredible although I mean there's been evidence of this as birds are just mentioned litter throughout just the last year\nWhat about the ... sat immediate cash ... she doesn't parents as a conspiracy and claims Qatar islands to Washington past what did you find when you left at an media outlets in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] I'm just fascinated up to the rise of misinformation through social media and in the news you know uh for authoritarian politicians and political figures all across the globe you see this dynamic I'm now ... whether you're in my andme are and and the spread of fake news through Facebook\nIn Brazil we're seeing the rise of\nThe the ... so you know the ... party using what's that spreads conspiracy theories and really dominate the election there and it looks like he's gonna win I'm just using what's happening spreading\nAbsolutely false information claiming that that you know leftist want to give prisoners or you know thirty thousand dollars a forty thousand dollars back bends when they're when they're in prison\nThat you know the leftist parties want to force children into\nUm you know homosexual relationships I mean it was really ludicrous stuff but it's meant to believe but a significant part of the population because there's this absolute spread of misinformation and and the Saudi Government you see I think a very similar dynamic with um them reflects lovely after uh the murder strategy I'm\nUsing these outlets that are controlled by rural family members or if connections to the government to spread also are exaggerations you know 'cause ... did have\nYou did attend some forums hosted by cutter um but you know it's much more complicated than that you know he's he's he's relationships with lots of political figures and their reflect reflects of\nInstinct to spread this conspiracy that he was simply a you know intelligence agents were cut her that cutter literally owns the Washington Post and that's why you wrote for them I mean\nHow do they also claim that uh it through the Saudi newspapers in an online sources that of the Fifteen are supposed to hit men that were sent to assemble to to murder him on that these were simply Saudi tourist and to criticize\nA a a this incident is you know a a Turkish media are western me to um effort to demonize Saudi tourist I mean it's just it's really ludicrous stuff but it's it's it's posted everywhere it's part of the kind of mainstream government discourse and unfortunately that's the world we live in ... it's hard to kind of correct as misinformation\nLeaf on his investigative journalist covering money in politics for the intercept his recent piece in the intercept looks at the Saudi Arabia and media outlets propaganda war against ... disappearance and alleged murder of Washington Post columnist democracy\nWe're also joined by ... the dark I heat and international correspondent for the independent covering the middle east to Europe and North Africa and it's your calls media round table we are talking about media coverage of Saudi journalist ... ... let's talk about ...\n... it's so interesting to see how that the Saudis have not been able to change the narrative and\nAt least when it comes to play outside of Saudi Arabia you have written extensively about the Turkish government and the leaks the daily leaks to pro government newspapers before we get into the details why do you think turkey is doing this can you explain their role in all of this\nWhat is that um you know turkey is a facing multiple pressures\nUm you know the one hand a fish killing this apparent feeling is it is really outrageous um uh on on a Turkish in Turkey you know in in Istanbul\nOf this kind of thing is not something that they would accept a foreign government doing um you know just like the uh the killing of the I'm a Russian or a double agent in London a laugh is that the ... a of a father and daughter\nWas outrageous the u._k. an and created an uproar so it's under tremendous domestic pressure to get to the bottom of this\nOn the other hand you know it's a kind of me is in a tough situation and one of the things that have kept the economy stable and not you know collapsing is Gulf money a real estate sales for example have remained flat despite the fact that the economy had this good listeners may recall the economy's had this dramatic or\nA downturn over the last much\nI'm with the lira down forty percent this year that Turkey's currency\nAnd so it needs it doesn't want to\nGet ahead no interest whatsoever in blowing up a relationship with Saudi Arabia and yet you know it has this tremendous a rivalry with Saudi Arabia right now president Richard pipe at one\nDoes not like and the F ... him as a reckless or X factor that he doesn't want to deal with this time\nUm and he doesn't like the direction of us\nA foreign policy I'm perky is a is it allies staunch ally of Qatar which are Saudi Arabia is trying to isolate and crush really this tiny country in the Persian Gulf I'm a Saudi Arabia is a ...\nAnd so on so you know you've got the situation where turkey and Saudi Arabia find themselves on opposite sides of the shutdown that turkey would light Saudi Arabia and and the Trump Administration not so close together and it sees an opportunity and doing that\nShow by having you on TALK knife and polite and you know meet\nWith Saudi officials and and so on and uh make very diplomatic comments while\nAt the same time aggressively repeating all this jerk about the investigation and all the things that they know they can play this sort of dual strategy of pressuring the Saudis without lecturing the relationship\nAnd just from the very beginning Turkish officials have leaked information about how ... was killed and dismembered inside the consulate they gave passport finance to news organizations you know as a as a as a longtime journalist and the region Barnes knew\nHow credible is this information\nI think that much of it is very credible and and I and I notice just because you're having lived in Turkey here for three years and have having covered it for more than ten years on you know there is this sort of symbiotic relationship between the security forces here and some members of the press\nAnd it's not as strong as it sounds you know in a lot of cases these guys grew up together so you have the local Turkish journalists saying hey you know Matt give me a school let me look at that security camera footage let me take those pictures and with the proliferation of you know what's happened signal and so on everyone knows about this stuff\nSo they can securely send it back and forth and you know it's very hard to figure out who this information\nBut I think in this particular case it's the you know I I have a suspicion that is the president's office directly kind of guiding the leaks because they seem to show up um you know very frequently in certain key us publications New York times Washington Post Wall Street journal CNN\nUm and you know these are what why those publications because that's who they are trying to influence there trying to influence Washington to influence shouting\nLet's take a college that max in Berkeley Hi max welcome to the show\nThank you very much for taking my call and thank you very good program I have\nTwo quick comments very disturbing one of them has to do with a relationship with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and this out this and that that period and if it was ...\nWhich I read the case you have to do with the fact\nThat the Saudis over the years and he already program or the Pakistanis to develop nuclear weapons and miss size and that this out and have a quiet the rights\nA three or four election cycles a where superPACs are just everyday generating these these huge seven figure eight figure ... numbers and I think\nFor a lot of reporters and even a lot of of viewers at home that kind of tune out the door okay well here's another billionaire dropping money in this isn't a scandal this is no normal so it's it's hard to kind of get eyeballs or clicks when something has become so normalized even though there's a very extreme feature of American politics\nWell and the other thing is in in the case of your piece chest and that is really incredible I mean it's I had it prints it out and I think it's about twenty or so pages when did Sheldon Adelson enter your radar and why did you decide to write this investigation\n[noise] yeah well um I actually hindered my radar for on this particular case because I I had been I'd written a previous piece about a to casino issues in Asia and the Trump Administration and and as part of that reporting\nI'd heard a sense I got a tip that um that we should be looking at what was happening in Japan with adults and so just to briefly give you some background um [noise] you know as we were saying I'm Alison company actually get most of its money now from its\nCasinos in Macau which is the southern territory in China\nUm but they're lucky they also have a big casino in Singapore and they're looking to expand to Japan or Japan actually just legalize casinos they don't exist there right now and they're only gonna be issue in a limited number of licenses there was a big competition right now among\nAll these big companies to get one of the ... century convinced the Japanese government to get one of these licenses so one of the things I looked at was it turns out that the Trump actually raised um Adelson company a in a meeting with prime minister of Japan\nUm which you know ... is again not his normal or for a president to do with a with a foreign head of state and this is actually become an issue in Japanese politics um you know the the legalizing casinos is very controversial there most people are opposed to it and uh some opposition politicians are now saying\nI'm accusing Abe's are tailoring the uh the the legalization bill and the regulations to uh to Trump and his donors 'em and you know we we definitely don't have a clear picture you know I Can't say for sure that that's happening but um this is clearly sort of in the\nThis is really an incredible story just and you write that late on a Thursday evening in February twenty Seventeen Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's plane landed at Andrews Air force base in Maryland it was his first visit with Trump I remember the constant media coverage of this\nYou report a few hours earlier Sheldon Adelson spelling seven thirty seven which is so large you can see a hundred and forty nine people touched down at Reagan National airport after a flight from Vegas they all had business breakfast and following that\nMeeting with Trump before boarding air force one for a weekend at mar a Lago the two heads of state dined patriots owner Bob Kraft and golf to Trump's Jupiter golf club\nDuring the meeting at mar a Lago that weekend\nTrump praised adolescence casino bad ... according to two people briefed on the meeting and the Japanese side was surprised according to one of the people briefed on the exchange they said quote it was totally brought up out of the blue they were a little incredulous that he would be so brazen end quote\nAfter ... ... he should strongly consider Las Vegas sands for a license that's adolescence casino\nOr they didn't really respond and said thank you for the information how unusual is this\n[laughter] yeah I mean it seems to be a very unusual I mean it's not um you know it's not unheard of for presidents of both parties to like bring up you know for example like some some kind of major aircraft sail boat or something like a sort of qualities I\nNational company like that but to bring up um you know the uh business interests of ah your your major donors um casino company or his is not normal\nUm and you know the of the other thing about that that meeting was like a ... of the night before a couple of nights before I'm Alison had had a private dinner with President Trump at the White House I mean which is part of a\nUm amazing amount of access that he's he's getting I mean again to to to sort of echo well he was saying I think this is this is a sort of extreme aspect of American politics has become you know even more normalized under Trump than it was before which is you have somebody\nLike Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam who are private citizens you know they haven't been elected to anything but they've given you know hundreds of millions of dollars over the years and you know he's he's dining at the White House more than once he is talking to Trump on the phone regularly or New York times there was once a month\nUm and uh you know and it's difficult to report on this stuff because when it's Sheldon Adelson and Trump on the phone I'm you know there is a very small group of people that know what was said so a lot\nOr it might just be the two of them in some cases so we don't really have a very clear picture of of ah what Allison is asking for other than um you know it seems clear that he he he has been a major force on on some of these Israel or Palestine policy questions like the moving the embassy\nRight and well let's talk about that in a minute and leave what would you say about reporting on someone like adults and when they've got and they have some calls with Donald Trump I mean how are you able to get information about what's actually happening behind the scenes\nI mean it's very difficult and you know this story from justice incredible because it really shows maybe not a quid pro quo but the normalization of\nAn incredible exchange of of financial benefits and political power um you have to kind of go through all kinds of sources on you know looking through customs piece you know he's he's covering\nFrom the Japanese perspective was reported in their media outlets are looking at a documents looking at emails and looking at sort of anecdotal things um and in terms of when people meet and and when things happen and Trump has been you know a lot of politicians do this but it's been so brazen and that you know in the last couple of months between sixteen campaign\nMost big billionaires in corporations um pass their lot with Hillary Clinton but a a select few a private prison companies mining companies people like Sheldon Adelson spent big to elect Trump and that that money really helped put him over the top especially in the mid western states where they focused on some of the ad campaign\nAnd he's gone back and said okay I'm going to basically what it looked what appears like he's going back and rewarding all of those late campaign donors the private prison companies are benefiting under Trump is asking of more preparations for them or the mining companies are getting the bailouts and and and and uh\nUm what what is the tax bill or moving the embassy and other Israeli policy or this or Japanese cars you know he's he's really rewarding Adelson who spent a lot to support Trump\nAnd he spends a lot to support Trump and he got back from the Trump tax break that's right and Justin as you report it the ... Adelson lobbied the Republicans to change the tax law suit with further benefit him he got one point two billion dollars this year what did he do exactly and what did he get\n[laughter] yeah I mean the tax law I think that the tax bill really haven't got enough attention I think the sides are the sort of a judiciary ... you know Trump\nJudicial appointments I think this is the really the biggest thing that he's done 'em and part of the reason I was in a gotten a enough attention is that he gets very complicated and gets boring very quickly but\nI'm the brief version is that um yeah Las Vegas and Allison's company um hire lobbyists that lobby both Congress and the Treasury Department on\nSome issues related to foreign tax credits that\nAgain get quite complicated but are very important for for sans in particular because it operates in Macau which has very high taxes but I'm long story short you know they've reported on there are in their public ah you know investor filings\nThat the tax bill was worth one point two billion dollars um to to the company or related to the same foreign tax credit issue that they that they lobbied on so\nUh you know who the Adelson family um controlled I think something like fifty five percent of the company so yeah that that's something that we that we do know through public documents you know is\nA absolutely massive benefit that um the adults in family has gotten so obviously basically all corporations benefited from the tax bill\nUm but uh you know this is a seem to be a particularly big number for Sam's\nToday we're speaking with Justin Elliot a reporter with ProPublica covering money in politics I Hope you can check out his latest investigation it's a lengthy investigation about thirty pages\nIt really worth your time Trump's patron and chief casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has never been more powerful\nThe Trump Administration has advanced his ideological and finance interests including and assist in his class to the casino in Japan we're also joined by le ... an investigative journalist covering money in politics and the intercept\nLead author of the machine a field guide to the research in right L E n Justin's piece Craig Holman with Public Citizen said quote I Would put adults in at the very top of the list and plus access and influence and the Trump Administration I've never seen anything like it before and I've been studying money in politics for forty years\nI think that's fair that's a fair quote I mean you see these stories where not only are is the Trump regularly of calling Adelson for advice but the kind of movers and shakers in the Republican Party are constantly flying to Las Vegas to solicit ideas and and ask for money I'm Corey bless the executive director of the largest\nRepublican superPAC I'm working on the house side to elect a Republican Congress I'm supposedly he just goes regularly Las Vegas and says you know we need more money and what do you need 'em and Paul Ryan often goes on those trips", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20"}
