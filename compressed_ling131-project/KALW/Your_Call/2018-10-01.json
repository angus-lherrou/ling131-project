R. G.\nPhyllis let's start off with you first of all thank you for making a sound really beautiful but also very heart wrenching\nAnd I and as you watch uh of course just fear I have yes I Know\nA lot of people are afraid to watch it I'm I'm I I don't know why it's not that scary\nWell I yeah I think you know people are there's a lot going on right now and there's a lot of people or you know there's a lot of depressing things in the film but it's so important to see so we understand that this actually began as an investigation into elephant poaching\n[noise] yes and that's one of the reasons that one of my earlier interviews was with Andrea because he started the elephant actually again I didn't know anything about elephants I didn't know anything about Africa five years ago I was\nKept getting these pictures like all of us do um four or five years ago with all the elements missing their faces and I I just couldn't believe that this was happening I'm so sheltered even though I you know educated first but I don't know didn't know anything\nSo I got to the bottom of it by interviewing over a hundred people in traveling to nine ten countries and I know way too much now [laughter]\n[noise] well and there's so much to explore but give me just one maybe mess that you thought about before you went into this because\nIt's oh that's a great question thanks rose because Americans want to go in with the army right we want to go in and just stop the poachers and shoot them in jail them and you know we've got a very pure and\nEthic and we're very world do that a puritan world view and um it is not about the poachers I talked to an Israeli guy who'd been on the ground for ten years in Africa and he said fills you can shoot poachers all day long\nIt is not them that are doing it if they're like Andrea says in the movie if if you're going to get five year's salary to shoot and all of them they do it here in Los Angeles they do it anywhere\nSimilar to end very poor and and I guess the you know I I'm ... and I get you know I I I meet you and I offer you\nTwo three four years of salary to kill a couple of elephants of course you do it and I would do it and er an anyone would do it to save your family so it's it's a\n... that's why it is very very important to ah to to fight to tackle the supply chain or along the entire supply chain not just in Africa because Everytime you all for it all in Africa for example would onto poaching young people watching is very important you keep animals alive but you don't address the problem\nOr you are in an audio with millions of really poor people\nI'm very often surrounded by\nHeavily corrupt government officials and so what would you want me to do I mean it's I cannot even you know it's I just do my mind my business and if someone asked me to get an elephant and I know how to do with\nThat I'll do it and uh and it's and that's exactly what on what the prosecutors are profiting off you know to the exploitation of millions of poor people that are ready to do anything\nMm fellas you also spoke with people who said that is so much of what we're dealing with right now is directly connected to the legacy of colonialism and Africa can you also talk about that well I think it's a very\nGood question I I think most of where the problems are focused right now had been in Central Africa in eastern Africa and they were ... by you know to the British on a whole and the Germans and the Belgians\nBut in Mali for instance there's this group called wild with Vance Martin and what they did was they went in to Mali to fight the um to save the desert elephants and there's not very many of them but they worked for two years\nWorking to go in and tell them what to do come on people here's what we're going to do no no nobody wants to be dominated they want to be included in the conversation they want to be you know educated but they also want to be consulted in part of the solution\nAfricans are not children you know they don't we don't need to infant and finance allies that we we need to include them so one of the things that they did was talked to the people in Mali about how to get the hottest who are coming down the ISIS was coming down into Mali\nAnd they wanted to kill the relevance and take their camels and\nThey sat down with these jobs and said look guys um we need our camels and here's why we want the elephants here it's one of the few interviews I felt like these people in Mali certainly there are some poaching incidents of the desert elephants but they wanted the elephant there's this\nThere's this word called ... which which is a beautiful word in many in many religions about how the unity and the health of all helps everyone like one part helps everyone to be well\nAnd they embrace this in this part of Northern Africa so it's it's really like a country by country basis but there is a push back to colonialism there is a pushback when you say hey how about some family planning you know like Andrea was saying\nI talked to a ... man that we want to do a project with to bring some conservation agricultural ... project into western Congo\nAnd I said could we offer the women who have one whole on average sixteen children can we offer them some some birth control and he sort of laughed and he grew up in this area and he's worked there for ten years with um with wildlife works to to to bring 'em some stability to this area and he said look\nThey have sixteen children there because the malaria is so bad they don't know how many kids are going to survive\nAnd the malaria nets that they were given are used to fish out the lake they're not used to prevent malaria and there's also a for instance you know there's which crap that's still practice and so they won't go to the health clinic they go to the witch doctors a cure their child of of um\nMalaria you know the the the president of the Congo hasn't supported this area for three decades so nobody's going to school\nIt wasn't it didn't used to be like that but you know again it's the corruption of the government leaders not protecting the people in self enriching and you know this is this film taught me the term clipped clipped talker say\nWhich sort of what we're witnessing here in America like our leaders are personally enriching themselves are not taking care of every one well\nAndrea what would you add because in addition to colonialism you have a lot of western conservation is going to different countries in Africa\nAnd basically saying you know this is what you need to do we need a park here and then you have corporations come in and saying we want to lodge here we're going to build a road here and push you out and I'm the man at the end of the ... and his name is escaping me but he's from ... was it survivors international\nYeah less yeah ... yeah and when we were talking about that Bach uncommon around being forced out by ... wildlife and\nAnd he basically said that it's not up to the people in the west to tell you know people hear how to live I'm Andrea what would you say about that Steven Steven Corey alright thank you\n[noise] um well it's a very difficult question because in principle ah I I agree with with those people see this is our ... our country our continent we [noise] we have to decide how to leave and how to manage our natural resources in principle I agree but I mean ... it doesn't it\nThey need the support from the west or you know to take better care of their of their natural resources including the ... and the national parks [noise] Ah yes uh many NGOs especially big NGOs arrive in Africa with a ...\nNot only with the big ego in a big wallet but also you know because of that they they think they can dictate ah [noise]\nAnd they have some very often to the successful in dictating produced people how to do it and what to do it and um you know and and it's and you get into a very difficult situation because there's a lot of money on the table um and for local ... I just give you an example without making you know doing and making any names but\nIf it began geo arise in the country like I don't know Kenya Tanzania\nAnd offers millions of dollars to do to you know to run the conservation projects protected bar protect the elephants it's very difficult to say no I'm a especially because they don't have money usually to do conservation very little money\nUh but by saying yes then they sort of become um you know the the deliveries of this big NGOs is is huge\nUm it's a it's sort of catch twenty two situation I I I think are African nations need west west in support to do a better job\nOr on the other hand are um there's probably a better way to do it um what but one important thing that is has a big impact on my work personally that\nWhenever big NGOs or any kind of and just start working with the government in Africa there is one thing they don't do which is instead of just collection any investigation because it's very dangerous because it pays off governments because you cannot\nPublish a harsh report that if you are in the country with the office and stuff they would kick you out of the day after the best part which is in my opinion huge\nIs is actually performed by very few organization like our organization on purpose we don't have offices in those countries\nBecause you know independence and integrity is everything um many other NGOs are in the business of you know running big national parks and launching large on ... on on the porch and campaigns and do capacity buildings in training all important things is done properly\nUm but but the but they tend to sort of become the new colonial east of Africa so to speak right because if I'm so be\nIt might you know died she owes so today our environmental NGOs that you know a hundred million dollars budget so you can imagine like companies when I when they arrived in ... in the country I mean very difficult to say no\nIt's it's so great because I'm\nOne of the women in my film Gretchen Peters she worked a lot in um in the poppy trade you know in Afghanistan and she said well you have to get your head around is America used to be able to exercise influence in Africa with its aid\nThe aid packages or dangling the eight or withholding aid they didn't participate and properly they have\nBut now that illegal wildlife trade is ten times what they get an aid\nSo it's very hard to exercise influence and get them to do something that's more appropriate\nBut what the promise of of my film and the promise of my intention of making this film is that we can actually help Africans develop their land differently than what we did in America look what we did we kept thirty million buffalo\nAnd we decimated the people living here and we put farms up and and a lot of people from Europe and other places came here but the colonialists didn't\nAfricans they they did a fence and shoot conservation policy like like are you know who was it wasn't Wilson that created our parks Teddy Roosevelt right that whole fence and shoot for hunters\nHas a product called ... which is already protecting wild orangutans who are basically you know murdered as agricultural path so um we created this this impact campaign has a conservation agricultural product and what we want to do\nIs make sure that all are farmers in\nGauge and learn about how to protect the environment sustainably grow could cow and they're also well paid and their children are aren't you know ... sold from one part one country and taken to western Africa to farm and work as indentured servants were slaves so that's what wild safe as about\nWell thank you so much Alexander thanks for your work and we will put a chocolate show on our list we should definitely do that or chocolates amazing well and then we we did a show about a ... last year you can find it at your call radio dot org and what they're facing\nThank you for calling let's go next to Virginia Hi Virginia Welcome to the show Hi how are you Hi Phillis [noise]\nOh it's Virginia morale oh my gosh you guys you don't know who this is [laughter] did you did she did she tell you who she was\nI I said that I wrote the book animal wise how we know animals think and feel and uh that I'd been\nI use for this film and I'm just so excited that it's a finally coming out that it's being premiered in Mill Valley next week it's next week right um\nYeah it starts on October eighth and then we have a one on the times on the thirteenth which had a great about Virginia is she's she's an amazing journalists and she writes about science and she writes about\nShe she interviews really smart people and she's ... and so she asked really smart questions and she was so great in the movie because she helped me transition from topic to topic to topic because she has a wide range of understanding of many many problems and including cookout including poaching including\nEverything and I and I was so inspired to talk to her because animal wise is a book about animals having ascension having more than a you know just an of they don't just to fill a need for human beings you know they they have light deserved it beeps yeah they deserve to be protected for themselves ...\nYeah and and I think that's one of the things that the film or gets across to is the fact that\nElephants and ... and the other animals in the forests the even birds they're all living in meaningful lives and having experiences the way that we do and they have emotions like we do because of our shared evolutionary past we\nScientists now know this and so when we think about trying to save\nAn animal like like the elephant a it's almost as if we're saving will ... part of our Kim ... or ... or ... that that has evolved on planet earth since\nI you know we're often struck by the idea of going elsewhere in the universe to find other examples of life and I fully support that I think it's entirely likely that we will but in the meantime we have extraordinary mine's right here on our own planet that we just are beginning to understand\nAnd it's has struck me as such a huge tragedy that we're also in the process of causing the sixth extinction and causing so many animals including the elephants to lose their place on on our mind\nAnd so what Phyllis is talking about his ways for us to address and to stop this I'm terrible extinction that's currently underway and yes one of the important things that we must do is to find a way to\nThink about the people who live in Africa and who live daily lives intersect with these large animals and how can they both live with these animals and protect them it's it's a daunting challenge\nAnd Virginia since you called in just quickly ... one of my favorite moments in the film was learning about Lawrence Anthony the elephant whisper who basically lived with an elephant heard for twelve years and when he passed away\nThe elephants were twelve miles from his house and they walk to the house in mourning and when they got to the house they were agitated and every year since then on the anniversary of Lawrence Anthony's dash the elephant heard returned to his house\nYes I Know it's quite remarkable but the you know that it is something that we see elephants do with each other that they all recognize the bones of other elephants that have had passed they don't necessarily recognize individuals but they do discriminate they don't stop and of\nUse their trunks to explore the skulls of giraffes or hip clothes or other or rhinoceros this other large animals they only do this with elephant bones and if an elephant dies\nUm they're companions usually stand around that if there's a child if there's an elephant calf than the elephant will the calf stands next to its mother's body and you know you can just see the emotion in these animals and their\nPerception of uh having lost a close companion so in the case of ah\nHe was going on but some recognition that they had lost a a real and then really a member of their community\nHuh well thank you so much for calling in Virginia would you please stand in line and we can get your contact info ... okay thank you and that is Africa Kenya Phyllis I'm Sorry what what was your last name morale St Louis in a book called analyze and she's in down while days\nYeah and she said I'm currently doing something for not geo with 'em how to become an oceanographer for for for kids there's a whole series are well and she's yeah she's really a smart woman and she'd be an amazing guessed I'm sure and Andrea just we have about Fifteen minutes less left in a couple of Marc hollers but before we get to callers\nCan you tell us you know what else do we need to know about elephants what else are we learning about elephants\n[laughter] [noise] oh what a what a what a what a ten million dollar\nQuestion [laughter] um [laughter] I mean I Know there's so much but I mean what what would you say that you want people to know who you're interacting with them\nOr give you an example um [noise] the reason why I call my organization elephant actually so we actually focus on a variety of wildlife crime ... I'm ... and things so that people ask me\nOkay you do oldies but why your organization is called at a friend actually cause I you know if you're ... you're not doing just the elephant says no no we're too We're doing a lot more [noise]\nBut I call elephant actually because uh I Would like to see the the the qualities of elephants in the people around me working with me\nAnd that's what I said all the time so of course the U.S okay what are these qualities why so for ... for example are are very powerful but at the same time humble and that's a quality that I Love to see in the people working with me [noise]\nA ballot funds have a\nA R are very very smart and intelligence beyond what you can think\nUh but at the same time they applied is intelligence to you know you know two important things there are no they're not showing off they're not using his intelligence to him to take power over other speeches I'm Ella funds are in in other friends who site these\nMayors are very important but females are more important and this is again and other things that I like to see in the people around me and the people especially people working with me and my team so [noise]\nUh no elephants and body so many good qualities a dollar for giving you the ... the the we should really try to learn from them and and see and try to seek this this incredible qualities in people around us\nAnd and sadly fell is another thing we learn in your film is that the poachers want the oldest elephants with the tasks and so these are the patriarchs my grandmother's the moms and I mean I Love the way you put it but it's just so sad it really gives people a visual all you have left to relieve the teenagers\n[noise] yeah that that was I was very happy to ask Virginia a morale this question because I um\nI'd originally learned this from Richard zero he used to be the the chief of the U.S fish and wildlife are very many years he lived in Africa for very many years and\nHe said it's like the lord of the flies I mean can you imagine what your community would be like if all the adults were gone and it'd be chaos and that happens you know elephants suffer from the TST\nAnd they don't know where the water is to be found they don't know if it's OK to mate do you know the young bulls were cold in South Africa for instance and Lawrence Anthony's\nUm heard saw saw there\nThey put them in another conservancy because South Africa's all fenced so the both started fighting and doing crazy things and kill unusual things like killing other species that they normally would just leave alone\nAnd so what they did to solve it was they brought an old will mail in\nTo tell them hey boys here's how it goes I mean I grew up with four brothers thank God I had a strong father because these guys they just we need to learn you know and and elephants are no different than humans we we all we all need our elders and we need to respect The Elders\nPhyllis Stewart is director of the new documentary wild days which is premiering at the ... valley film festival you can see it if you're in the area October eighth tenth and thirteenth and hopefully it'll be available more widely soon we're also joined by ... executive director and co founder of the elephant action league", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
