in today for rose Aguilar on a very interesting subject today nobody wants to think that they're biased we certainly want to think of ourselves as non racist non sexist non prejudiced\nBut there's a new documentary called bias and it shows quite frankly that it's just not that simple if we're human we have\nBiases even if we have no idea that we have it unconscious bias affect life changing decisions\nSuch as who gets hired at work or promoted who gets a mortgage and how criminal suspect might be judged\nAnd it turns out we may be even programming our buys these into our computers into artificial intelligence when filmmaker Robin Hauser took her first implicit association test or a a tea uh she says she was shocked\nBy the results that test measures unconscious bias and when she frankly flunked out test she set out to dig into the science around unconscious bias\nTo see if there's anything that we can do to reduce its influence Robin ... is director and producer of a cause based documentary films at finish line features\nAnd she is president of unleashed productions her first award winning film entitled code the bugging the gender gap\nPremiered at the Tribeca Film festival in twenty Fifteen\nAnd her most recent film bias is looking into unconscious bias and how it's affecting us socially in the workplace and in our lives in general and Robin is here in the studio thank you so much for being here think here's a question here what a great subject you know\nEverybody wants to think no I've looked at myself I've examined myself\nAnd I figure if it's there I've addressed it and by simply looking at it end addressing it surely I have rooted out all bias in my life how wrong or people\nWho think that way well pretty wrong it's fascinating to me I'm David Rock actually from the Neurological Institute says that just like we can't do to math problems in our head at once and we don't have the ability to recognize our own unconscious biases so we really can't see the things that we're biased about\n'em on and on on a conscious level it's fascinating right so\nI did a lot of people on the street interviews and I would ask people you know ... or do you consider yourself as a person can you share some of your biases with me\nAnd um most people say well yeah I'm very fair and I don't really have biases that say okay well what about your friends and family are they biased at all oh yeah absolutely and so what's fascinating is that we can see it in other people but we can't see it in ourselves\nYou know there's a sort of visual test in the film and it's a story about I'm a father and son who are in a car crash\nThe father dies in the car crash the sun is rushed to the emergency room [noise] the surgeon comes into the operating room looks at the boy and says I cannot operate on this boy he's my son\n[noise] and it's real brain teaser in a lot of ways because you figure I'm Sorry isn't the father did what do you mean he's my son the answer is that the surgeon is a woman and she says mother so I thought\nCan be equally deemed as equally competent and likeable but and this is by both men and women except for some reason\nWomen and men have a difficult time with a woman who was assertive\nAnd competent and the reason for that again is because she's going against societal norms which is that a woman should be um doing motherly things and should not be in the workplace being aggressive and assertive um and\nI guess competent I mean how sad is that\nWell in effect you're saying a woman who wants to be successful can be either competent or likeable but not\nBoth it's very difficult for a woman to be a leader in the business world especially if she's had to come up through um a pipeline where it's mainly men um and and be really likeable unfortunately\nYou hikes are you shocked that this is the case in twenty eight team did you think we would have come farther or is this about what you is that it's doomed now and ...\nI was completely shocked I mean I really I mean obviously I feel it so I Know that we haven't gone as far as we really should have gone at this point in terms of sexism um I think what shocked me most was realizing that start up community which were millennials right I mean some of these\nUm some of the younger people and start up communities are my children's age and it absolutely shocked me that there are these sort of massage district or sexist tendencies in started culture I I thought that we would have gotten much further right now\nWe're talking to Robin Hauser she's a documentary filmmaker her most recent offering is called by us we're talking about how biased both conscious and unconscious has crept in to our lives in ways that\nAnd I don't know it's probably a shock to to everybody\nThat I'm we still have these issues eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five is the number eight six six\nSeven nine eight T. A. L. K. or join us you know speaking of of women um you talk to some uh several CEOs who are involved in venture capital so what did you find were\nThe ripple effects of implicit bias\nIn business and particularly in in the venture capital world\nYeah unfortunately female founders are not getting um funded at the rate that men are in fact\nI think the the statistic does that night teen and into thousands sixteen I'm less than four percent of\nUm venture funds went to women founders um and that shocking and I wanted to understand why is that just blatant sexism um is there a difference with with women founders um and I really I think it boils down to unconscious bias I think that there's\nMany um venture capitalists look a pattern matching so what what's worked in the past and what can continue to work and when\nYou look at pattern matching in that way women founders aren't in that cycle yet because they're so you know there are there fewer of them\nWell one of the stats that you bring up in the film is that while only eight percent of the start ups are funded for women and only one percent for African Americans when that I'm number is increased uh those companies that do I\nActually do something like Fifteen Percent better in the case of females when they're brought on board and in the case of African Americans startups do thirty percent better\nSo this is quantifiable if you bring if you step outside the comfort zone and bring it under represented groups there's a benefit\nStudy after study shows that um teams and leadership teams companies that have more diversity are more profitable\nUm have have greater reach are are much more successful so yes you're right it's shocking and there's an interesting study that was done in June twenty eleven um that was published in the Harvard Business review called the female factor and it states that regardless of the individual I. Q. of a group of men\nUm if you if if you introduce one woman to the team\nThe collective IQ rises and then if you add more women the overall IQ continues to rise so there are good solid reasons scientific reasons why it's important to have women and people of color on your team\nThat feels sort of like a carrot and incentive\nBut does there need to be a stick to I mean I'm the state of California Jerry Brown has just enacted um I don't know how long it's going to withstand perhaps a legal challenges but um companies based in California are going to have to have at least one woman on their board of directors is that a stick and will that\nWork along with the the carrot incentive of companies actually do better when they have women and minorities on board\nYeah Bill I think that's as the eight twenty six when I was thrilled to see past\nThe problem is is that if you talk to a company like Facebook or or Google um or Twitter some of these companies that are very successful and you say to them look you could be more successful if you had more diversity\nI don't know how much that matters to them because they're already fairly successful right and so in that case you have to just provide the argument that it's the right thing to do no avail yourself to to diversity of thought I'm is the right thing to do regardless of the facts\nYou know I I have never really been a big believer of quotas but I Will tell you I'm beginning to believe in them and I think sure if they're not going to\nAppoint more women to the board a point in our women to um upper management and then um if we need to force them to do so absolutely because then we'll get women in the room and they will shine and people will realize the benefits of having women there and racial minorities that too I've slowly\nYou talk about the difference between a culture fit and a culture contribution [noise] um and there is reason to value both yes\nYeah I think that there's there's a lot of emphasis on diversity diversity but if somebody actually doesn't feel someone who is representing the diverse minority I'm\nIs in a company but whose opinions aren't being valued whose voices and being heard and they're not truly being included in that conversation in the company so one thing as diversion that's the second thing um to actually you know inclusion is equally if not more important\n[noise] let's talk a little bit about whether\nThe bias we carry is conscious or unconscious you speak in the film with Laurie McKenzie she's the executive director of the Cleveland Institute for gender research at Stanford and she says ultimately whether you intend to be biased say against women or having unconscious bias if there are no women on your team\nThe effect is the same so just describe the difference if you will between conscious and unconscious bias and whether it matters at all when it comes to outcomes\nRight so I Would say that\nUnconscious bias might be let's just say that I'm In an elevator and I'm a certain type of person walks into the elevator and suddenly I clutch my purse I might not even realize that I Do that that's probably an unconscious bias that whoever just walked in I made of snap judgment an assumption that that person\nMight be a pick pocket her right now sometimes that's a safe things just to do and sometimes that's really not safe to do\nBut if I then made the assumption that every person that had that type of persona or profile was potentially a threat and therefore I didn't hire them or I didn't befriend them or I didn't respect them\nThen I'm being biased\nOr I didn't give them a mortgage or if I'm a police officer if I use a more violent approach it plays out\nIn ways absolutely and that's a whole different that's a whole different issue right the bias that's working its way into these predict of algorithms um that is really frightening I Believe because I think that if we're if we think about the fact that humans are always going to be biased we it's really hard for us to get over that I mean it is a a protection every measure\nSo we have to really slow down and think about the decisions that were making were they based on the right facts right\nSo it would be really wonderful to think that artificial intelligence given that it's not humid it doesn't have a human brain could be free of bias the problem is that we as humans are programming these algorithms\nAnd we're also in charge of data input but there is no governance of regulation over the data input to see that it's fair inaccurate therefore\nHistorical data is being used\nSometimes just skewed data is being used and you can see this already in Google searches in online translations societal stereotypes are being\nTranslated and transformed right into artificial intelligence so it's making if for and they are black boxes to right so that's a problem because you can't actually see the data that's being put in or the algorithm but if suddenly you're turned down for a credit card or for a mortgage I'm for a bank loan even for maybe\nThat that you lived somewhere at some point in your life with a ZIP Code where more people typically default on loans and really have very little to do with you as an individual mhm [noise]\nWe're speaking with Robin ... she's a documentary filmmaker her most recent film is called bias [noise] men and women both perceive women to be less\nNo benefit of experience and the past and what you've experienced\nRight without taking into account anything that we've learned from experience that for instance if I once was mugged in an alley in a dark alley at night I probably should learn from that and maybe not walk down that alley again dark you know late late at night\nBut I Can't make the assumption that every time I walked down\nAn alley or every person that is also walking down that Eli is going to be a threat\nSo is this is especially important in in policing so if a policeman walks up to a car and um you know has his hand on his holster is cautious in one's whoever was is in the the the driver's seat turns immediately and takes out a gun and shoots\nObviously the next time that police officer approaches a similar situation with a car like that with the same sort of profile and make up here she is going to be very cautious they have to learn from that previous experience what they call it training scar\nBut they can't make the assumption that just because\nSame profile person is in the same type of car means that that same experience is going to happen that's pretty superhuman\nOur guts that limbic brain that that lizard brain that warns us what's dangerous and what's not how do you overcome what's hardwired\nThis was one of the hardest things I'm One of the most fascinating things that I learned also making this film that I was growing up or taught raised on follow your got right I mean I think a lot of us were sure we'll go with your gut what is your got sick and everything I learned from making this film is slow down and question you're got\nMake sure that that snap judgment or that gut feeling comes from something that really matters and not just some stereotype or assumption that might not be true\nEight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nIs the number we're talking unconscious bias unconscious bias with\nRobin ... is a documentary filmmaker enter a new film is called bias eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five what's been um your experience with this issue I thought it was interesting that you mentioned\nUm uh the rules that people assume you said when you think nurse you think female you think surgeon you'd think male everybody kinda knows that\nBut it's kind of translating now into our online lives and artificial intelligence one example that someone mentions in the film is if you Google the word grandma\nWhat comes up is this taboo below of cute little white grannies elderly white women with you know white hair and all the grandma features and so what does that say about how our buys these are now part of our online and virtual experiences\nRight I mean Ninety percent if you do a Google image search for grandma ... Ninety percent of them come up as older white women and what's shocking about this as I was in the middle East I'm over the summer\nAnd I asked a group of um high school students to Google in Arabic the word grandma and to do an image search and the same images appeared older white women oh interesting I said to them how many of you see anybody that looks like your grandma\nIn these pictures not one of them raise their hand so what this shows is that\nThe computer is going by associations right it's word and bedding and associations and it's also has shows that data input\nIs not fair inaccurate\nRight that nobody's overseeing that when you do a Google Search for a certain word that it accurately represent\nWhat the word say grandma means on a global scale ... now the risk and this is that let's say that an algorithm or us as a human being trusts everything that we get on the on the Internet and we take that as the fact that this is what the word grandma means older and white\nAnd then I use that to make a decision about grandma's whether it's about medical the medical decision or social decision you can see how that completely marginalized says\nPeople of color and anybody that doesn't fit that one profile\nThought it was interesting too that recently in the last couple of days Amazon um had to shut down a\nAn algorithm that they had created software that was designed to help with them with the hiring process turns out it wasn't all that gender neutral\nUm they found that the computer was screening out whenever they saw for example um that the applicant attended an all women's college\nIt was that shocking to you that somehow it's crept into a uh\nTo me but um it it further punctuate the problem with artificial intelligence and with these algorithms that you know are are obviously very intelligent but they don't know how to act on um ... again what is fair an accurate so\nIn in this was sort of a secret thing that Amazon had um they were working on helping trying to make the the applicant the hiring process more you know easier really um into him putting all of these um resumes\nAnd what they let's just say that they were looking for engineers well the computer it was all based on pattern matching so the past successful engineers had this profile ... likely they were male and they were of a certain age so the computer on its own through deep learning\nUm learned that the ... the people that were hired and were successful\nDidn't have the word woman's as in you know somebody attended not just women's college but even if you said that you were the leader of the woman's group or leader of the women's initiative and if the word woman was in there or if yes it happened to be an all girls school like Smith or something um those applications those resumes\nWere cast aside while they because they didn't fit the pattern of\nHis the historical um data that were the successful hires in the past it's pretty extraordinary yeah and it's unintentional right at Amazon's intention was good their intention was and this is why they've now done away with this um until they can fix this problem\nBut and I and I applaud them for that you know they were on it that they saw the ... the minute that they saw that this was not a\nFair and that it had this gender bias they they scrapped it um but it just goes to show that we cannot trust computers fully we cannot trust these algorithms we need to really be on top of them\n[noise] we've talked about bias implicit and otherwise uh let's see what our callers are uh are talking about in terms of their own experiences let's go to Carmelo in San Francisco first like our Miller thanks for holding go right in\nThe morning thanks it's such an interesting conversation so I definitely saw course that biased with Hillary Clinton with electability and my competence but I'm Wondering whether this is more of a cultural or or or an actual\nUm hardwired biased because I'm thinking there are a female leaders around the world so I'm just wondering whether there's something different about or does it go from culture to culture how is that that and\nIt's a great question why it was Great Britain able to have a female prime minister no problem or Indira gundy or Germany or Germany what what's happening in America\nYeah no I think that's I think definitely there's a societal um component to this without a doubt um and I think that like every society has biased every human has biased but what we're biased I'm against or about definitely changes based on different culture and indifferent societal\nNorms and in the case of\nUm the United states and politicians shore we've never had a female president right so we don't have a benchmark we don't have a role model in that way\nSo I think that the scrutiny you know with which we look at a female candidate and and think about even the worst that we use to describe her as a candidate shrill in her voice was shrill um she was not likeable because she was assertive and aggressive and again in our society those are not things that we necessarily value and women\nI think I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did a creep into the Kavanaugh hearings in terms of who was believable and who was not\nThere um that that we had and um yes probably you know I'm it's it's disheartening to me that um sexual abuse had to come into a hearing like that and that the outcome is the the way it is um because I I feel like it's sort of dilutes the importance of women speaking out and coming forward\nWas there a gender bias component penalty think just based on the inside said you've been able to gather\n... I'm sure I think there's a certain amount of that and I I think um\nI think there was [noise] All right let's go to Lisa and San Francisco Hi Lisa\nHi ... yeah and this is such an interesting topic and I can't wait to see the film on what I wanted to make things about the actual reality and the police and everything like that is that I mean that argument is is very valid but", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
