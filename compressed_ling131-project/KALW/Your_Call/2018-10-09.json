cameras Aguilar and this is your call\nAt any given time in the United states upwards of one hundred thousand people are in some form of solitary confinement solitary confinement is everywhere in the United states today and every part of the country the average size of solitary cells are six by ten feet\nSo few visualize that that's about a parking spot\nThe new book six by ten tells the stories of Thirteen people whose lives have been deeply impacted by solitary confinement\nJournalist ma tailhook writes quote this book being about solitary confinement is by its very nature about violence against the spirit as well as the body and mind but at its heart this is a book about America and quote\nMaterial hook as a writer oral historian mixed media journalist and co editor of the book six by ten stories of solitary\nAndme ... joins us in Studio ... welcome to the show they do so much Rob wow thank you for writing this book it was really intense to read and I just want to point out that this is the voice of witness book have you have written another book for them called Palestine speaks narratives of life under occupation\nAnd what I Love the series because what's so powerful is that\nThere are all these books out about mass incarceration and I'm Glad they're out there but what's so amazing about this is these are the voices of people who are who have been in solitary or people who have been affected by solitary\nYeah absolutely I mean the the the whole point I'm both books one of the book series itself is to hear from people who were directly impacted themselves so it's not a journalist kind of taking and packaging their stories I'm In their narrative you're hearing directly from people\n[noise] how did you get involved in this project after your Palestine speaks book [noise]\nUm well I I knew I wanted my next project to be domestic after working for so many years in the middle east on on the Palestine speaks book\nUm and a very good friend of mine to put her dress a head you know has more or less dedicated his life to to reforming\nUm the the ... system and so he uh you know he and I got to talking a many years ago about kind of the the gaps in invoices that people get to experience from those who are incarcerated particularly those who are in the darkest corners of the prison system right\nSo you know as a as an attorney to their works with the ACLU and as an attorney he\nYou know often just give the share very small portions of people's stories the most dramatic parts that are going to make the for the bus a forces in a lawsuit and a journalist we do that too right we often just\nPinpoint the the most like affecting thing that we can get from someone so we both felt like offering a readers in our audience the chance to really get to know people in an intimate three dimensional where uh was was going to be very powerful\nAnd how much did you know about solitary confinement before you started this project\n[noise] well like I said I'm friends with Taylor and who doesn't really shut up about solitary confinement so I knew a fair amount but you know uh I learned a great great do over the four years it took them at this book\nAnd I love what you both dead sort of offering ten point primer on solitary confinement in the United states and you offer just very basic facts the first one is so important\nLong term solitary confinement meets the legal definition of torture according to the un long term solitary for more than Fifteen days constitutes torture and violates fundamental human rights\nWe've done so many shows about the prison system in this country to point three million people are behind bars more than any other country in the world and solitary confinement isn't all parts of the system in this country the average size of a salad six by ten feet\nWe can't talk about all Thirteen story so I wanted to ask you because you spoke to these people you worked on their stories and it's hard to just pick one I Know but\n... you know if there is one that you'd like to talk about one that may be sticks with you when you go to bed at night which one would you like to share\nA lot of that's really tough [laughter]\nUm you know there's there's been quite a few of 'em will they all affected me you know I Can't think about any of the interviews I did with people without\nYou know feeling without feeling it um that's that's Israel's I can be I mean these stories are raw and people were very open with me you know I'm a I was very fortunate to build relationships with people where we got to we've got to go deep I'm into into their experiences before\nA prison right learning what they were like growing up and what their childhoods were like and then you know what what took them into the prison systems and then once they were there what took him into solitary confinement and the trauma that experience there the trauma they saw their\nYou know I I can definitely talk about like one chapter but you know one of the things that I think sticks out to me that that ... and just how\nAre these themes show up in a book right like what people see in solitary like the fact that you know I see in my introduction you know one of the things about this book 'cause you're hearing from people who survived\nWas in fact because a lot of people don't a lot of people die in solitary and a lot of people deteriorate to the point where meaningful interviews aren't going to be a possible afterwards right and so I hear from people over and over while I'm doing these interviews over the last four years like what they saw in solitary the fact that you know people around them were just\nYou know deteriorating mentally spiritually emotionally I'm On a daily basis without help without risk by\nAnd that looks like a lot of things that looks like some very disturbing thing that I might not get into on the radio here but within the book\nWell yeah I mean I you know after the last week that we went through in hearing from survivors telling their stories on the show for the first time and then reading about sexual trauma and violence in the book I mean it's intense you know and this is this is so pervasive\nThat also is amazing about this said for every person that you interview you have this beautiful\nPhoto of that and that's been drawn mhm yeah and they're they're I think they're almost all of them are smiling\n[laughter] yeah I mean the human spirit is strong you know and and and like I said you know the people in this book came out with their their body mind and spirit more or less impact um and uh so we're very lucky that they were willing to share their stories with us and we're very excited to share their stories with our readers\nYou say that some people don't make it out of solitary do these prisons keep track of it is and is this public information I mean can we find out say for example in the state of California where a lot of people are behind bars do does the public have the right to find out how many people have died in solitary confinement\nOh um yeah the you know the prison systems often have their way of accounting for things that aren't\nNecessarily true so like you you would be hard pressed to find someone on their death certificate say like they died from trauma from solitary it would be high blood pressure or hypertension you know it'd be all these physical effects\nThat could be amplified by by the time in solitary confinement but you know you're not going to be able to draw a direct line but yeah people people died and you hear from the people\nWho do make it out like what actually went down inside\nThe your book points out that um ... it when people spend time in solitary confinement\nWhat happens is they have a whole really intense mental illness I mean in many cases this is what happens and it's not even solitary confinement just in prison in general\nYeah I mean look if you go into the prison system\nPresenting with any kind of mental illness right which a lot of people do write a mental illness often is kind of a natural reaction to a very ... culture in which obviously like we're we're poisoning the very land with which we are live on it and and need right so\nA lot of people who go into the prison system may present with some kind of mental illness and when you can't immediately adjust to a violent oppressive a pressure cooker like situation you might have an issue with a guard if you have an issue with the guard your punishment might be to go to solitary confinement\nAnd you might need Ninety Days without a disciplinary infraction to get out of solitary well if you're already struggling with some things and maybe you're not medicated properly\nOr miss medicated or you're going to have a very very difficult time in solitary not like banging on your door trying to get someone's attention or trying to get help which can all lead to more disciplinary infractions another Ninety Days\nAnother Ninety Days and that's how people end up staying for for weeks and years amongst\nLet's talk about one of the stories he you write about\nA short intro you write ... has her hands full she's a young mom of three and also works fulltime and an elder care facility she makes time to talk with us in the evening while taking care of her small kids and often some of her two brothers kids as well\nAnd she's aged twenty five she was interviewed in Anchorage, Alaska\nAnd ... shares her story in the book about how her partner Dave and mostly was imprisoned and how he was not able to she was not able to contact him shortly after she was finally told that he could receive a visit her she learned that he passed away she was told he died of natural causes\nAt the funeral she saw that he was severely injured him nuts on his head deep cuts from restraints bruises and marks from what looked like being dragged ... learned later that he had been denied medication for schizophrenia\nAnd apparently had been punished with solitary for confronting an officer\nCan you tell us more about this how were you able to learn if he was denied medication for his schizophrenia\n[noise] uh [noise] I mean yeah I Believe he was a that story is very very difficult for them or you know it's been a lot of time\nOur interview and ... and um you know for me to play with their kids and ah you know those kids don't have a ...\nUh [noise]\nYeah I mean big one was killed in solitary confinement there or you know they were shooting pepper spray or him while he's naked in very obviously mentally deteriorating uh in his so [noise]\nUh you know why is the naked why are they pepper spraying and through the food supply and the door I mean they've on story is just an embarrassment to that\nPrison system to about facility to the people on duty and and any one that is even remotely coal is an embarrassment it's it's a tragedy\nBut yeah he was he was definitely Medicare or of outright on medicated for is a [noise]\nFor his um bipolar disorder\nAnd ... brought a lawsuit against the prison where he died and her narrative she says the department of corrections had to pay her family six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars but she doesn't know what kind of consequences if any the guards who abused Avon will face\nI don't think they ever face there and on the death certificate it says he died of natural causes high blood pressure\nAre like an ulcer or something like you know which is true I mean that is true right like he he did die of internal injuries from the trauma of being and [laughter] you know that's true\nBut ah what doesn't going about is the beatings he took a while he was stripped naked why he was dragged 'em and uh you know why he was he was represented and abuse or\nHave any of these cases brought any kind of change [noise] or are they all individual and there's a payout and then\nAh like that yeah you know I think yes I think the\nUh the lawsuit um in in Alaska did did for some change [noise]\nUm some review some policy kind of things but no one was ever held accountable to my knowledge um other narratives in the book yeah you know some people do come out of these situations and fight to make it better for the for the people they left behind inside\nI'm Sonia a Sony's narrative in the book a sudden you got involved with um [noise]\nAn organization in Dallas called the trans pride initiative she had been a house and um [noise] you know\nTo put in solitary you know quote unquote for her own protection um anyway when she got out she due to cope with an organization called transcribing the shooter and they um help implement some change around how uh I Believe the the local jail deals with um trends women\nHe's not um on he's\nHe's like I'm\nYou know he's just like the kid next door\nUm that happens to suffer with bipolar Mm\nUm and if I can just clear something up legal has been in solitary\nOr um\nThe whole time it's not in and out um\nHe's been in solitary confinement I'm ... I think he did sixteen days I'm an open population in the ... has been solitary confinement\nSolitary for six years\nYeah over all over six years yeah [noise] so\nHe Nico is ... is your first child he was born in September Nineteen Ninety two he'd be cat and began taking medication at age ten for a range of mental and emotional challenges\nWhen you tell them a town that when you first visited Nico in prison after he was sentenced he'd already been in solitary for two and a half years he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at ten and when you saw him you say you knew that you had two hours to save him what what was that first visit like for you\nBut um it was one of them\nBy orbits occasion and I'm I'm so that's what happened I applied for visitation and as soon as my a visitation was approved they removed Nico is education\nAnd um he so that's why it was two and a half years before I could see him wow\nUm show there was absolutely no contact for two and a half years now me go was Nineteen when he was sent to prison so\nI'm the last time I had seen him was in court\nAnd now I'm driving six seven hours to this prison and it's called the special visit\nThey have it on a death row Nico was not on death row but\nBecause if the special visit a no contact visit 'em it on death row and um\nAnd he goes like in blocking this little phone booths and there's um a divider glass between us\nAnd um\nYeah uh\nThe only reason why I was able to him was\nUm me go\n[noise]\nBecause of the the beer isolation\nHe started to deteriorate his his um I mean you could pick a healthy brain and put it into solitary confinement and\nShot healthy brain will deteriorate so\nImagine if you are suffering with bipolar or some type of mental illness\nCan only imagine\nHe started to deteriorate and um she just stopped eating\nDying just laying there are dying\nI Believe that's when the Palm Beach post\nDid a story on me though\nAnd because of that story\nThe prison system kind of woke up\nAnd went downtown\nAnd realized that he was\nAnd um\nThey made him healthy enough to where I could come and visit they actually called me and said we want to come and visit your son\nWhich never happened\nAnd so I said of course\nAnd when I went to visit Nico for the first time\nI'm he didn't know who I was\nHe couldn't make eye contact\nWas forty pounds underweight\nHe looked like a Holocaust victim\nI couldn't touch him\nYou know separating out\nMy son and I can clearly sees actually dying\nSo I had to\nGet creative and I had to\nUse every bit of strength that I had\nTo bring you need to go\nI'm back from basically that\nIn the first thing I knew I had to do is get him to make eye contact with me\nUm because he couldn't make eye contact\nUm enjoy June too I Would\nContinually call his name is ... name and challenge to look at me\nAnd I would call him you know\nI used to call my you know need\nTalk about is is there is and I just kept talking and talking and I had a lot of energy and I\nI ... you know\nTapping on the glass and and telling them to look at me and then I don't know how long it was I don't know if it was twenty minutes or forty five minutes but\nHis eyes goalie went from ... or\n... came up to my eyes\nAnd when he locked eyes with me\nHe you could see that he recognized me and he said\nAnd I fell back into my chair and just\nYeah and he gone here\nI literally of color in his base started to come back he was as wide as the gold and and and he was\nHe wasn't sure if it was me or if you were you know\nImagining it makes it illegal I'm really here I'm here and you know ... once you know he realized that it was real and that I was there than we are just went to work ... you know this is what I Need you to do I need you to eat I Need you I Know that there is\nRoaches and maggots in the food I Need you to pick the mountain and soon as you leave your breakfast that made you choose do you know an exercise routine and we went over we went a step by step each exercise if you would do and we\nWe did the whole entire day\nWe mapped out his hold back what you would do worse than he was ... and then he would exercise and then he would write and then he would read it and you know then he would take a nap and then at this time and we did the whole retire date and I just went over and over and over it\nAnd I kept telling him how much you love and ... and how much we meet him and how important here\nAnd giving him like value\nAnd has her car ... yes ... sorry to just step and I just wanted to ask you you know when you when you learn about what Nico has gone through trying to deal with his bipolar disorder\nIt's just so much about how the system fails people I mean when he did he should not be in solitary right now he should have received to\nHelp that he needed and and I think that's so important to point out so Nico was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before he went to prison\nAnd you told ... that ... your Social Security covered his ... his medical costs but when he turned Eighteen that stops because he became an adult and so you have to start the process of getting him covering all over again he lost access to his medication he lost access to his doctors\nAnd then he started to self medicate with ... down and he became addicted to it\nAnd um he needed money to support his habit\nAnd so he he committed robberies or he robbed a Pizza Hut and a CBS and as you pointed out they these were armed robberies there were no bullets and the gun and he did this to support his actually coat on habit whereas what he wanted to do is actually get help\nI can absolutely absolutely he he didn't want to be\nUm you know a drug habit I don't drink or ... I don't think there is a drug addict alive that wants to be it's a it's a very hard life it it you know um you just live for the drug you're a slave to the job and I'm\n\n... was so out of control um\nAs far as\nI have two younger daughter and um\nI I Know I'll never forget it I we were in the living room and I sat me go down and I\nHeld his hand and I said before you know I Love you\nBut you've got to beat\nI can handle or that you can here and\nThere was no fighting or anything Nico started to cry and um\nHe how we help each other and I told him in the minute that she's ready to get help to call me I don't care free in the morning or whatever you know that phone call came two days later", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
