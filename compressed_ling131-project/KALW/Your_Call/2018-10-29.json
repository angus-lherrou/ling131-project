Seventy Stevens halt\nAnd Dr ... joins us in Studio ... welcome back to the show and thanks for having me it's great to have you\nWell this is a fascinating book looking at the relationship and the choices that scientists make\nDuring the Cold War and we're still living with the consequences of a lot of their work including the atomic bomb\nWhat do you decide to write about this about the relationship between science and politics during the Cold War\nYou know I didn't know that I was writing a book about science and politics in the Cold War I thought I was writing a biography of a geneticist named in glass\nI'm Glad this was a civil libertarian he was the kinds of scientists to many historians of science uh said had really been marginalized during the Cold War because of their work on behalf of scientific freedom\nAnd as I researched the project I began to realize that that's not what was happening with Bentley Glass and some of these other scientist at all\nA while he might have had some trouble I'm On the domestic front with the FBI an a and McCarthy has them on the international front a Bentley Glass a very close relationships with the state department and other government agencies promoting the values of American science and brought\n'em and I began to realize that this was a much broader story about um how ideas about scientific freedom really the relationship between science and freedom and democracy were part of the global Cold War and ideas about um\nAbout the virtues of American Life\nWell I'm guessing that a lot of people have never heard of ... glass can you tell us a little bit more about him sure\nBeen glass who's a geneticist who was a base of Johns Hopkins university I he was famous almost as much for his role as an administrator as he was for his science but the thing is that he did a tended to be in the area of radio genetics so the effects of radiation on um on genetic inheritance\nUm and obviously this was a huge issue in the Nineteen fifties or\nThe ... the usage of the atomic bomb um and he became very outspoken about the dangers of fall out this was a period when atomic bombs are routinely tested in the atmosphere um a book the United states and the Soviet Union were doing this the u._k. was doing this\nSo there was a lot of radiation around the globe during this period of time and glass was one of the scientist who was trying to bring the public's attention to that and that's part of that he became very involved with um some international scientists groups that were working on disarmament like the public\nTheir series of stories on the CIA is vast network of private partners changed how the public understood the work\nOf the U. S. government and you open the chapter that's so interesting chapter eight I'm with is on February twelfth Nineteen sixty seven the White House received a deeply and welcome tap\nRampart radical west coast magazine plan to expose the CIA is long term involvement with the national student association a respected mainstream organization of collegiate leaders rumors of secret CIA funding channels had been calculus circulating for years\nBut the timing and content of the rampart article threatened to blow the lead off the CIA is entire network of private organizations\nTalk more about the importance of that kind of reporting in the late sixties and and what it did\nNice thing about the story was that it stayed secret for as long as it did at the structure of relying on private partners meant that thousands of people had access to secret information that they didn't necessarily want um these stories eventually broke because some of these secrets were being trusted in ... in in trusted with college students\nUm up until the period of Vietnam um many Americans were willing to keep those secrets in the broader um you know in in in terms of the broader work of of anti communism\nA but his public attitudes about communism and the ... the justice of the United states a war on communism as these concerns were getting stronger\nPeople were beginning to have more concerns about that for years journalists had been hearing rumors um in some cases they would report bits of it in Nineteen sixty five\nAh some of these fake foundations ended up in the in the newspapers or because of the hearing about tax law that was in Congress I'm In which someone realized that uh some of these foundations that we are tax exempt weren't quite what they seemed um so\nTo keep they were willing to not print them I'm In the broader national interest in my Nineteen sixty six and by Nineteen sixty seven that consensus was changing these journalists had decided that you know the time had come to talk about this\nIn part because of the stories we're going to break anyway it whether it was going to be a young people talking about it or whether the covers we're going to be blown by some other parties\nUm so the spring of Nineteen sixty seven and a became almost to a ratings were in in news and newspapers between ... and the New York times and the Washington Post there were a series of you know almost ... almost daily front page stories\nAbout this group was you know this labor group received money this arts group received money this group of intellectuals received money on and on and on and on\n'em and when you read those some of the conspiracy theories you can you can understand why some of those conspiracy theories came about\nBecause it looked like the CIA was involved and everything that's not quite the case that's not really what was happening here um but a certain amount of paranoia um it it's understandable when you read the newspaper reports and when you see kind of the the depths of the links\nWell so what was the fallout from these reports I ... when I read the section I was thinking a lot about surveillance and the New York Times' decision to withhold stories\nAnd I'm the reporter James rise and who left in New York Times and now works at the intercept wrote all about what happened at the New York times and said what was the fallout\n[noise] right well I should I should preface what I'm about to say a by saying that I don't have a clearance today and so I'm having a I I've never had a clearance um and so I'm having to assume that what I've learned is um you know an adequate at a reasonably accurate representation of what's being half of what was happening [noise]\nUh but the short version of this was in Nineteen sixty seven I'm senior foreign policy officials decided that the consequences the costs of having these\nPrivate partnerships was too great to be here\nUm and so in Nineteen sixty seven a President Johnson decided that the CIA was no longer is going to be funding these kinds of private groups that appeared to be a private independent groups that were really something else or the CIA really got out of the business of a cultural diplomacy in Nineteen sixty seven\nWhich isn't to say that the entire government got out of cultural diplomacy\nA but it became more of the province of overt agencies whether that might be the state department or the U.S uh information agency and obviously these groups had been doing that word all along um but the decision at that point was that the United states should only be conducting its culture diplomacy through overt groups\nToday we are speaking with science historian Audrey Wolff about her new book freedoms laboratory the Cold War struggle for the soul of science and if you have any questions for address about what she uncovered\nShe writes extensively about the role of science has played an American cultural diplomacy after World War two and uncovers the close relationship between the U.S government and private scientific groups\nAnd then she also explores what we're dealing with today today's war on science and she argues that scientists have to make a choice and the ongoing struggle for freedom\nAnd equality and you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nEight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G. if you're a scientist we'd love to hear from you how do you think history should judge scientists like Oppenheimer of the head of\nThe Los Alamos laboratory who's credited with being the father of the atomic bomb for his role and the Manhattan Project and then he later protested against us plans to build the hydrogen bombs what are your thoughts on that\nResearch about the Cold War when ... when the media started focusing on this and Nineteen sixty seven do you know how other countries respond to this especially affected countries [noise] um\nThe response is surprisingly muted the state department was absolutely worried that there would be a crisis and they sent out a series of circular as to you know international post about how they should respond\nA but surprisingly um there were very few repercussions one different one place where there were was in India so India decided that no us foundation could support worked there for a few years\nUm because you know one of the consequences of these low uncovers with that many people felt that it was now impossible to distinguish between legitimate\nI'm really you know a international groups that were genuinely independence um and those that had been a cover\n'em in the Indian government decided that they also could not make that decision and so they basically got a uh stopped working with American Foundation for a few years I'm In some other places some of the literary um some of the literary journals that had been funded by some of these friends were banned\nUh there was one called ... which was an an Arabic language a kind of arts and letters sort of literary magazine ah that became that was banned from certain parts of the Arab world after these covers were blown\nUm but for some insist the response was surprisingly muted the one exception was in the uh American anthropological association we're a mini anthropologist who had been doing the work that's ... realized how closely their work resembled intelligence gathering and many of them became deeply uncomfortable with doing this work\nUh we're working with the government in any way but I Would say on the whole of the international response was surprisingly muted under the circumstances I think one has to put us in the context of the\nA rising international opposition to the United states involvement in the Vietnam War I think by Nineteen sixty seven these revelations work particularly surprising to a lot of people and they were sort of in keeping with um what many nations were already beginning to think about the United states government so they weren't it wasn't a drastic change in that way\nIt did scientists from other countries like the United states and other countries did they travel to other countries to take part in conferences to talk about all of this um yes\nI Will not necessarily to talk about the revelations um but I Would say the phenomenon of international conferences\nIn an odd way absolutely related to these ideas about um a a Cold War that involves ideas about scientific freedom of the United states wanted to project itself is the opposite of how science was being conducted in the Soviet Union\nUm so the United states has really pushing the idea that science and the Soviet Union was intensely nationalistic intentionally uh you know intensely devoted to just national goals I'm In that it was close that you couldn't do science and the Soviet Union you know if you didn't have some kind of a you know communist affiliation\nAnd so the United states really wanted to protect us image of the opposite of that and so the United states absolutely I'm encouraged many that scientists to participate in international events\nEven sponsored some international events\nAs a way to um you know tell the rest of the world look the United states values open science um and you know for the record that's a lovely idea not all of these ideas are terrible ideas um but they're also not naturally occurring and so to talk about some of these ideas as kind of Cold War propaganda\nOr um you know ideas that had to be constructed in maintained these were choices about how science should be um and this is the idea that science should be international\n[noise] today we are speaking with Dr Audrey Wolff a science historian about her\nOf science she examined several scientists played an American cultural diplomacy after World War two and uncovers the close relationship between the U.S government and private scientific groups\nShe also explores today's war on science and argues that scientists have choices to make and the ongoing struggle for freedom and equality this is your call will be back after this\n'em and so the initial hogwash meeting was held in ... Nova Scotia in the name stuck um it had another name I think the committee on worldwide scientific affairs a but people generally call it puck wash\n[laughter] I'm looking at ... dot org and it says pug wash seeks a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\nThrough our long standing tradition of dialogue across divides that also earned us the Nobel Peace prize in Nineteen Ninety five\nPug wash aims to develop and support the use of scientific evidence based policymaking focusing on areas where nuclear and W. M. D. risks are present how strong is this group now how active as this group today they're still around\nI I you know they're they're high point was really during the Cold War both I'm\nIn the early Nineteen sixties in the lead up to the a partial test and agreements and then again in the Nineteen eighties their their role and some of the disarmament negotiations um they are absolutely well intentioned people who do good work\nUm and they may not have been wrong in the idea that they could do this kind of work if they appear to be a a group of independent\nUm scientists but what's really interesting about the I I don't know much about their work in the Nineteen eighties but the period where I have studied in in the late Nineteen fifties or early Nineteen sixties what's interesting about that work with\nAs uniquely free from political considerations and they contrasted their ability to do that with their Soviet colleagues\nSo the idea was that if they were negotiating on a technical point that the Americans would be more trustworthy because they would be basing their opinions on scientific evidence on technical ability where's the Soviet ... uh where it's a Soviet participants might be basically political hacks\nI'm so they were trying to project this idea that the Americans would be better negotiators because they weren't affiliated with the government\nTechnically it is true they were not affiliated with the government\nBut they were absolutely doing uh what's now known as back channel negotiation or sometimes called track to diplomacy the state department was very interested in exploring this notion of track to diplomacy I'm basically when private citizens are working alongside or on a separate track from formal diplomatic negotiations\nSo the American participants in pug wash would have briefings at the state department at one particular meeting in Moscow um of hogwash meeting in Moscow in Nineteen sixty\nSome of the American participants were getting debriefed every night by the American ... uh by the American ambassador to the Soviet Union\nSo yes they were nominally a group of independent I'm kind of transnational scientists that they were working very closely to make sure that the positions that they were negotiating uh we're in keeping with what the United States wanted to see happen ...\nThere were some of the scientists that challenged us called war policies and its arms race with the Soviet Union\nIf we want to look at real oppositional stances like one of the best known for good reason his Linus Pauling\nAnd pilings a role in the story is quite interesting because it highlights some of the differences between a doing this kind of work um in cooperation with state power or separately Pauling was involved in the earliest days of the pug wash movement which started out really has a nuclear abolition movement a movement to free the world of bonds\nBut as a the test and go see you know as as um these these negotiations between the United states and the Soviet Union continued it became clear that the United states government would never go for that\nI'm so instead they would they might be open to the idea of a test and so a lot of the scientists involved with hogwash\nThey got on board with the idea of a test than it was a smaller bowl but it was an achievable goal\n'em and they thought there was something to be said for that Linus Pauling for his part really stayed committed to this idea that um we needed a world that did not have nuclear weapons and he quickly became sidelined uh from the pug washing movement because he seemed an outlier\nUm he was making arguments based on moral and ethical planes as opposed to scientific lanes and it became very difficult to fit him into um that kind of logic from where pug wash gets its expertise like the the excerpt that you read from the website if you're making a moral claim about nuclear weapons that's very different than an evidence base claim for nuclear weapon weapons\nIt's appalling is an interesting character to see what it looks like if you really do want to make a political claim Pauling was more than comfortable to say nuclear weapons are wrong and and\nYour section science for diplomacy right that by the summer of Nineteen sixty two calling us chemist had already won won Nobel Prize for his work on chemical bonds and was well on his way to picking up a rare second Nobel for his work on behalf of nuclear disarmament\nFrom Maine Nineteen fifty seven to July Nineteen fifty eight polling collected the signatures of more than eleven thousand scientists from around the world in support of a nuclear test ban\nThat's pretty impressive obviously that was before we had on line signature gathering and then you right over the next five years he wrote books gave hundreds of lectures and engaged and verbal fisticuffs with physicist Edward Teller director of Livermore National Lab the loudest advocate for ever bigger bombs\nAnd Pauline also faced repeated investigations by the U.S Senate\nYes um and the fight between polling and tell her is actually really telling because it was a moment for some of these other scientists are like Bentley Glass who I mentioned at the at the beginning of our interview 'em to\nKind of distinguish what they were doing such someone like mentally glass who was involved in pug watch who absolutely embraced these ideas that science could operate free from politics\nPilings I'm kinda screens against the bomb seemed to extreme they they didn't they seemed in temperate they seem to not objective um and even though\nGlass would say that he was more sympathetic to ... position he didn't like how Pauling was doing it\nUm and so he criticized both Pauling and tell her up for being emotional in their responses to how they talked about the bomb for bringing in their political attitudes about it\nUm now at the same time what's interesting about this you mentioned appalling had assembled these petitions of eleven thousand scientists Pauling was a more than willing to make a moral argument but he did think that scientists had a better standing to make that argument and other members of the public\nOn scientists weren't the only ones who are waiting a fight against the bomb and there were many thousands\nOr millions perhaps of people across the world many of whom weren't scientist at all who also were engaged in campaigns about the bomb who um you know took the slightly more radical position that you don't need scientific knowledge if you're if you're making a moral claim you don't need to sign you don't need scientific credentials to make that claim\n[noise] and you write that for a brief moment in Nineteen forty six it appeared that scientists advice might come help us to participate in some kind of international uranium authority with control\nOf Atomic Energy play squarely and civilian hands but by late Nineteen forty six the rise of anti communist sentiment and revelations of atomic espionage and the U. S.\nDiminished scientist influence over atomic policy\n[noise] great Nineteen forty six is a very interesting moment in American history for these ideas about uh whether it might be science or kind of international relations in general um you know the United states and Soviet Union were allies during during World War two they had a complicated relationship but they were on the same side against fascism\nUm and for a couple of years there are people talking about things like world governments you know what the UN was going to look like\nUm there was an interesting kind of global from it about the ideas of of how you would prevent a global catastrophe like World War two in the future\nUm and people were experimenting with all sorts of ideas including a kind of a more optimistic idea about a global control of a you know an Atomic Energy that ultimately didn't come to pass it with sidelined by a rising anti communism and then I think in Nineteen forty seven\nAnd a scientist become the target of the house un American activities committee and many were accused of being communists\nThe position of Nineteen forty seven if you were trying to understand what happened in World War two from a military perspective it seemed like science had one world war two for the allies\nUh whether that was about the atomic bomb or radar or about the proximity fuse it seemed the scientists had the the scientists were the thing that had made the difference\nUm and so the United states wanted to make sure that it was going to continue to have that advantage in the future\nIn the meantime they had been very concerned about the amount of Soviet espionage during World War two um and there was a Soviet espionage including in the Manhattan Project so the Soviet Union had 'em more information than the United states wanted it to have about the American nuclear program\nI'm so in Congress in particular several senators and congressmen were extremely concerned that scientists are going to be the weak link 'em\nOkay did for understanding and telling the story and twenty Eighteen is that it was both a witch hunt but some of the witches were real if you want to use that language of which ...\nAh there was an extremely fever search for communist and the government but we know in retrospect that there was a fairly elaborate Soviet espionage um effort that was fairly successful in getting secrets from the Manhattan Project which doesn't mean that the vast majority of American scientists untrustworthy in Nineteen forty seven\nUm but it's the story is a little more complicated than than many historians retelling it even Fifteen Years ago when it may have seen that a just a lot of you know that there was a lot of McCarthyism a unjustified attacks it has become clear that you know there were some real concerns about intelligence\nUm unfortunately these concerns were not handled any kind of thoughtful way but really a a blanket smear on American Scientist", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
