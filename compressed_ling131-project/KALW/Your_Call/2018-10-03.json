before doing where they discovered and the thing with a loaded roof over\nNow [noise]\n\nAre and this is your call today could be the last day of the FBI investigation into allegations\nOf sexual assault brought against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThree women have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault according to reports the scope of the investigation is very limited\nAt Julie slept next allegations may not be with in the scope and the FBI has also reportedly been told not to investigate discrepancies\nBetween Kavanaugh's description of his drinking in college and high school and accounts from his former roommates and acquaintances who described him as frequently excessively and belligerent lead drunk\nAccording to reports from NBC more than forty people with potential information about the allegations have not been contacted by the FBI Dr Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers say the FBI have not responded to a letter sent on Tuesday she has not spoken to the FBI\nTo talk about the latest about this investigation\nAnd we'll also talk about Mitch McConnell he says he's going forward with the votes in the coming days does he have the votes\nMichael Stern is an attorney with Thirty years of experience as a litigator twenty five years as a federal prosecutor for the United States Department of justice and he spent three years as an assistant district attorney Michael Stern joins us from Culver City Hi Michael welcome to the show\nSo you for having me thank you for joining us and we're joined by league good mark a law professor at the University of Maryland School of law and anti violence advocate and author of decriminalize domestic violence a balanced policy approach to intimate partner violence highly welcome to the show thank you for joining us\nThanks so much for having me\nWell we keep learning new things it seems by the hour and Michael you wrote an op ed for USA Today called let the FBI do its job we're now learning according to NBC that potentially more than forty people with information about the allegations have not been contacted by the FBI\nSo when you say let the FBI do its job\nDepending on who you ask that is a very different job what what do you mean by it\n[noise] well from the prosecutor's perspective what I mean is that the issues that were raised during the course of the Senate Judiciary rings was Thursday\nNeed to be investigated and the issues were wrong they related to the actual allegation of sexual assault but also an important way they're related to\nAllegations and belief the a drudge ... was not being honest and forthright when he answered questions about a variety of issues related to his past including drinking and comments that were made in your book\nUm and so my my perspective as I said as a prosecutor is to let the FBI investigated anything and everything that might impact shutting is for a position on the United States Supreme court\nLeave what would you add [noise] I think that's entirely accurate um I it's mystifying to me actually that when judge Kavanaugh's credibility is so at\nIssue as to the extent of his drinking the amount of his drinking the impact of his drinking that all of these witnesses who have seen him engage in that behavior and have important information to share aren't being talked to\nIn addition that Dr Ford that Mr merits haven't been taught to which if even if you had a very narrow investigation would seem to need to be the essential components of investigation um is just appalling\nThan and let me jump injured that's absolutely correct as a prosecutor the first thing that you would direct view if we are to do would be to interview the victim Christian lousy forward so the idea that the FBI\nI yeah that's how I went to find that\nRight so then okay so that was a very short question and it would have been nice if there was a longer exchange so in this case what could the FBI do Michael especially on this question did you get so drunk that you didn't remember what you did\nWell one of the things that they should be doing is they should be talking to Brett Kavanaugh and they've decided not to do that either and so\nAgain you chose ... it's an additional keys in a puzzle that when you look at the broader picture makes clear\nThat the FBI is being directed by the White House and probably the side of the Judiciary Committee to limit what they're doing but but they should ask Brett Kavanaugh more detailed questions that he may feel comfortable telling them in the privacy of an interview that it's not being public we broadcast\nAnd he may ultimately in that type of setting you'd miss it in fact there were times that he was blackout drunk\nAnd that would in some ways allow\nThe the circumstance that was described by Dr forward to be juxtaposed over the possibility that the Kavanaugh was too drunk to remember it and it may in fact\nResolved some of the issues that I think that we've been trying to figure out based on these hearings\nSilly how could this even be a quote credible investigation if the FBI is not talking to Brett Kavanaugh or doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nIt's not I mean that that's really the short answer is it's not a credible investigation when folks advocated for an investigation\nWhat they were advocating for was for a neutral body to go in and really look at the accounts of the various people who were there that night or could have been there that night [noise]\nUm and people with information that tended to show that what was being alleged was either more or less likely to be true by not talking to the victims in that case and I include misery marathon that as well\nThing to talking to Dr Ford by not talking to a judge Kavanaugh not talking to the forty people who've called in um I think that's really problematic if they're only going to talk to for people who statements denying anything are already on the record\nThat's not the kind of investigation that anyone asked for and I think it's worth noting that at least one of those people and really the most important witness mark judge is someone who talks about having blackout drunk more times than he could count in his memoir is that something that he's acknowledged that he's taken a a some kind of accountability for\nAnd so it's impossible I think to think that we're ever going to get the full story of what happened that night ... but by not talking to many of the major players were not even going to get a percentage of that story\nAnd again had Michael\nLet me just jump in on that point because I think it's an important point and the the corollary to that point is that there is a danger that I think it was created by\nThe perception that the FBI does what they typically do which is a thorough investigation but not having that be the reality and so I think it is more problematic in more dangerous for the FBI to have been assigned to do an investigation and for the public to believe it at an investigation occurred\nBut for the FBI to hand tied in the investigation that they're doing and the reason that I think that's especially dangerous is because you're then makes the FBI by being limited in the way the White House is limiting them\nDo a superficial investigation in which they appear on the surface to have done something of substance but really the investigation because they'd been so a limited the investigation is skin deep and I think the the the corresponding danger to that is it allows the Republican Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd the president to announce to the public at large we do the investigation that the Democrats won the FBI investigated and they didn't find anything and so what happens then is that\nThe the idea that the FBI investigated his left out there without and understand a full understanding of the FBI didn't do the type of investigation that they would\nThen I think that that's going to potentially results are likely result actually and Brett Kavanaugh making his way to the Supreme Court than by limiting the FBI investigation to a superficial won the Republican majority will be able to say we did what you want so quit complaining ...\nAnd Dr danger\nMichael Stern as attorney ... an attorney with Thirty years of experience as a litigator and twenty five years as a federal prosecutor for the U.S department of justice he also spent three years as an assistant district attorney Lee good mark is a law professor at the University of Maryland School of law and anti violence advocate\nAnd author of the book decriminalize domestic violence a balanced policy approach to intimate partner violence\nAnd on today's your call we are talking about\nWell what do we call it an FBI investigation or as an FBI investigation that's not really an investigation because the FBI is not talking to Brett Kavanaugh or doctor Christine Blasey Ford if you have any questions or comments about this process\nThere's a lot of moving parts you can give us a call at eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nElite what about the fact that earlier this year I mean Donald Trump went on Twitter and just ripped the FBI I mean he appointed Christopher Wray had the FBI after he fired James Comey\nI mean I was just looking at one of them and here's one from February you know the top leadership and investigators have the FBI and the deal\nIn favor of Democrats and against Republicans what is his relationship like today with the FBI do you know\nI Would imagine that it's fraud um I don't know any more than I think anyone else knows from reading both the tweets of the president and some of the tweets and other information that have come out from other branches of the executive\nUm but you can't talk about people like that who take an enormous amount of pride in the work that they do and in the service that they provide to the country and think that there'll be no impact\nUm you also apparently in this day and age the president can say that today and tomorrow I agree with Michael what he will say as you asked for the FBI the FBI is the best law enforcement body in the world they did a thorough investigation they found nothing and therefore we should all be okay with judge Kavanaugh seeming to see it on the Supreme Court\nUm I I don't think the president of consistent about anything from day to day I don't expect us to be any different\nBut I also don't expect that to improve his relationship with the FBI are these are people who put their life on the line quite literally him in a world in which we use the word hero a lot for a lot of different things these are people who really do risk their lives their safety to try to keep this country safe and to try to do the kind of a good law enforcement work that the federal\nUm prosecution system depends upon and to trash them time and time again it can't be good for that relationship [noise]\nWell the other question is what is going to be done with this report because senators are talking about and disagreeing about whether or not the report when it's completed will be available to the public\nDianne Feinstein says it should be kept confidential Lindsey Graham said it should be made public Mitch McConnell said it would not be Chuck Schumer said it should be released I mean what about this Michael how are these decisions going to be made how well the public know what was actually found\nWell my assumption is that the White House and the Senate Judiciary committee will make a decision as to whether or not they want to release\nThe report in whole to the public\nUm my belief is that it will probably not be released to the public but instead what will happen is that each side will pick out select portions that they think support their position and they will talk about those portions as talking points\nTo either complain that the FBI didn't do a sufficiently thorough investigation and Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court or alternatively from the Republicans are saying look the FBI did what you ask them to do the didn't find anything of substance\nHe needs to go to the Supreme Court\nLeave what do you think\nI Would agree with all of that except that I think it will leak um and so whether they choose\nTo um handle it publicly or not at some point I think all of the contents of that document will be no to all of us um I actually\nJust go ahead\nI was I think the lose right I think it will leak and the problem with the leak is going to be that the public will then read the report and not think\nOf the fact that the FBI was hand tied when they conducted it so what they will see is potentially a complete report um some paper to paper and page to page but not understand that this is not how it typical FBI investigation should have taken place\nAnd that had the FBI been given free rein to do the type of thing that they do the report would be very different than it is ultimately going to be\nAnd I think that's true of ... of a Rachel Mitchell a memo as well um that you know Rachel Mitchell memo is\nAbout Dr Ford and pulling apart Dr Ford's testimony is nothing about judge Kavanaugh it provides no context it provides no other side and the leaking of that memo has made it look as though there is no\nBe telling the truth because there is nothing in it about judge Kavanaugh testimony it's a powerful document for those who want to say doctor for it as a liar she's being motivated by democratic operatives as a memo says and I agree with Michael I think it's very possible that that report will be used in the same way\nWhat if Kavanaugh just doesn't recall it Lee\nHis first if the caller is still listening I just want to say I'm so sorry for what you experienced um and that you have to raise your trauma now to answer this question um I think\nIt may be that he doesn't remember it and if he had come forward and said you know as a young man I drank a lot I drank too much I don't remember everything that I did it's possible that I did something that I that harm someone and if I did\nI Am unbelievably sorry for that and here all the things that I have done as an adult to overcome that\nRight and and talked about his basketball teams and the ... and all of these other things and if he had said that nobody would be questioning his honesty at this point right nobody would be saying well he's lying about how much he drank and he's lying about ... he was he's lying about\nHis anger which you know if you hear 'em accounts of these incidents it makes you wonder does this person had the judicial temperament that's necessary to be on the bench\nSo I'm not too interested in his memory and how much has it proves are deaf parents what happened to the doctor for it I I Believe Dr Ford I Believe her account of events and I believe that right\nThe capital and why he is or isn't fit to be on the Supreme Court\nI Can't say that everything that somebody does as a teenager should disqualify them for the rest of their lives what I can say is that if you lie about those things if you fail to talk about your the full extent of your responsibility for those things than you are not fit to be on the court\nWell I I just want to thank you so much if you're still listening for calling and sharing your sharing your story and my last week ... during the hearing we broke in and just open the lines and it was just color after collar after caller who talked about being sexually assaulted many were sharing their stories for the very first time\nAnd I want to just give out the ... national sexual assault hotline it's eight hundred six five six for six seven three eight hundred six five six for six seven three and during that show which you can find that your call radio dot org we also talked about\nVarious ask therapists and clinics that have sliding scale so if you're looking for any sort of help or therapy and hopefully you can listen to that show we also have links your caller radio dot O. R. G. let's hear from Kathleen in San Francisco Hi Kathleen welcome to the show\nI um yeah I said\nSo obvious that it's unfortunate the FBI is being hamstrung and\nI don't understand is Trump changed his tune out early and said that they could do anybody wanted he wanted it to be as full as possible and so forth and so I'm totally weird for him to say that but he said that way can\nThen go ahead and have and free and open investigation\nWell we've been talking about that Kathleen and unfortunately this is a guy who changes his tune you know every couple of hours in some cases I mean we haven't even talked about how he mocked Christine Blasey Ford and just yesterday on the campaign trail but let me take a couple of more calls and then we'll get responses let's go to Terry in Palo Alto Hi Terri\nHi I'm all for taking my call I agree that what people do in high school is a in some ways past history and the lying about her ... Horton\nWith a piece that really hasn't come out here is that\nThere is no walk out drinking from light alcohol consumption or what some people call social recreational drinking blackout drinking hers when this organic changes happening in the brain from regular ongoing heavy\nDrinking and it's really inconsistent with a report of high school age drinking they're very very few kids or ... um\nThat have that level of organic\nChange and that's partly why I think we should be concerned with his drinking because if you drink heavily and people are going to just this was out oh he was having a blackout\nWe have another pause on her hands were how someone who in fact may be a very heavy drinker and now being put into a into a judicial position and the highest court that's my comment\nWell thank you very well get a response and just a few minutes let's first go to Greg in Palo Alto Hi Greg\nAlthough I Hope not to read the story about the sign a couple\nOf things was clearly a the Democrats than Trump\nGo on a thorough investigation that's clear streams that they're willing to go to get this man on the Supreme Court is really unbelievable that reminds me of requires promise we need to also I Would just want to make more comments real quickly one of\nThe the report the the this lawyer ritual from Arizona put out she's claiming that she wouldn't prosecute the folk think that was what I heard when I listen to the news the other guy and this isn't a prosecution that's not her position to get information\nBut one thing the other thing is I watch the frontline report last night about the call me stuff and it's clear to me why Trump won because this guy on the court I don't think it has any of over you waited cetera he wants if if the lower investigation ever ends up\nIn front of the Supreme Court Trump wants to do that this guy is go to you know use the ... have his back the want somebody on there that you can depend on because I think mall are really getting closer and closer to really kneeling Trump and I'd love to hear your comments\nWell thank you a political had a piece called Brett Kavanaugh's radical view of executive power Trump Supreme Court nominee threatens to undermine the Mueller probe who would like to take that one\nA happy to jump in Brett Kavanaugh is is known to have and has\nPublished a information published articles and and and took the position of particularly during the Clinton years when he was part of the Ken Starr investigation against Clinton indicating that there is broad presidential power to avoid being prosecuted um during the course of\nThe presidents who lives in in ...\nAnd that obviously would be very helpful to Donald Trump is Robert Mueller want it to bring an indictment ... anything to add Lee\n[noise] not as to that I did want to get back to the point you made about ... the mocking of Dr Ford um because ... in her testimony one of the things that Dr Ford said was the worst thing that I can imagine is having this I'll become public turned my life upside down and nothing happens [noise]\nUm and in some ways this is worse right because not only did nothing happened she now has the leader of the free world ah talking about how not credible that she is\nUm ... and what I Hope is that Dr Ford of hearing the messages from people across the country saying what you did mattered because\nAll of those people are now coming forward to report and all of this people are empowered by what you did\nI think it'd be very easy for a doctor for it to look at this process and think to yourself why in the world what I did I ever open my mouth\nOut and it's easy I think for other people to look at it and think I'm never going to say anything to anyone if this is what that brings on and for those people who really need to reach out to other people\nI ... I Hope that's not the message that they take 'em in so many ways the election of President Trump has set back the anti violence causes the allegations against the president himself the way that he's dealt with allegations about those on his staff the way that he appoints people who've been accused of intimate partner violence and now the way that he mocked Dr Ford\nUm it's important that we remember that this is just a moment in time um and that and keeping the progress that we've made on anti violence work continuing to help people understand the impact of memory the impact of trauma\nUm and what resources are available to them even if they choose not to go through the criminal system which I think is a huge part of this you know Dr Ford didn't chose choose to go to police and that should not bad results and no one believing her and it shouldn't result in that for other people that either\nAnd and tonight sure go ahead Michael\n... one of the other things that I think um you know is tangential to what you're saying is that what what Donald Trump has done and the movement that he is creating in which\nJudge Kavanaugh which Brett Kavanaugh has somehow been maneuvered into the place of the victim and Christian for the actual victim has somehow been recast as the perpetrator accusing a man\nWho didn't do anything of doing something is especially dangerous for the idea that that you know that women need to come forward and identify when they've been a\nSexually assaulted and this was a phenomenon that I used to see in a much smaller scale when I'd prosecuted sex crimes cases what would happen\nCrime would attack the victim and somehow maneuver her into the role the perpetrator and it's happening again I'm seeing you again on a larger scale so yesterday what Donald Trump said was how awful it was that anyone could be accused of anything even if they're not guilty\nAnd then you follow that up with a comment to the public that people should think about how this could be happening to their sons and how this could be happening to their husbands ... especially dangerous to allow\nSexual or so you went to maneuver himself into the roles of victim and make it appear as though the person who's actually the victim is doing something wrong by bringing charges fourth\n[noise] well it seems to be that this is the talking point because Trump's son has said that is the conservative talking heads are now repeating this", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
