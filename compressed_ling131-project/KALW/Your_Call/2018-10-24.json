Barbara Kingsolver joins us in Studio Hi Barbara Hi welcome to the show thanks thank you so much for coming in well You're welcome I was watching a talk that you gave when you were inducted into the Kentucky writers hall of fame\nLast February and this is just a couple of months after the election\nAnd you said\nKentucky's a wonderful state you said I'm not going to assume anything about any of you accept that you love books it's safe to say you share my feeling that nuanced communication took a hit when the loudest rudest tweet carries the day where does that leave those of us who believe in literature [noise] what's your answer to that\n[noise] never the less we persist [laughter]\nUm I think um well when\nI began writing this novel you know for five years ago I was I was looking at a world that that frightens me because it seemed more polarized I'm a than than a anytime I've ever known before\nAnd it was getting more and more difficult to communicate across these various divides um urban versus rural a agrarian versus industrial um science versus religion all this versus I mean there was this\nFeeling that people were kind of hunkering down and getting more and more dedicated to hating people different from themselves and I thought I Need to write a novel about that um and so novel of course is a nuanced [laughter] and layered look\nBut but it seemed clear to me that this has to do with a state of insecurity of\nThe feeling that we're losing familiar shelter at many levels at even at the level of the household economy\nUm the pension that we were counting on isn't there the healthcare we were counting on isn't there so I thought it would be interesting to look at this in a historical way and compare this moment to an earth\nAnd it focuses on two families separated by more than a century who live at the corner of six and plums streets is it Vineland yeah Heinlein Lynn Neary and across time they share struggles that so many people are dealing with today they're caught in political battles their homes are crumbling they're losing loved ones they're losing their dreams\nThis just really does sound like the book really does sound like what we're dealing with in today's time in fact some ... some of the reviewer said that this is one of the first novels political kind of novels that came out under the Trump Administration and if you've read on sheltered if you have a question or comment for Barbara Kingsolver\nAbout any of her past books about her writing we'd love to hear from you the toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\n[noise] we had at the last time we had you on the show over the phone was about animal vegetable miracle on ... which is about you and your family living off the land\nAnd I guess we're not prepared for that interview I was so focused on the book and not your past and this time I was able to actually learn more about your past uh-huh which was which was fun is it true that you went to university on a piano scholarship it is yeah\nYeah I um yeah I started as a as a as a music major and then and then\nI'm quickly figured out\nThat uh I'm about eleven people in the country would get to make a living as concert pianist and I wasn't anywhere near [laughter] league good enough to be one of 'em and so I\nI I jumped over to biology it seemed more practical though the thing I really love to do all along was read books and right but that I had no idea that\nThey have that I get to do that for a living but I studied biology in college and graduate school he grew up in rural Kentucky I did and then you worked as a science writer in Arizona I did ... ... what was that like well it was my first job out of graduate school and um I because I had\nThis ah this body of knowledge I studied you know botany\nChemistry physics uh zoology so I worked for the University of Arizona and that was one of the uh it was kind of a niche market I was one of the few people um because I also loved to write and I loved you know crafting good language and and accessible a reasonable language\nThey could send me into a lab to talk to some you know buddy some physicists are so I'm I'm a chemist or a biologist about his project and I could listen to\nYou know his or her a description of that work and then I could come out of the lab and translate it into a language that non scientists could understand so that was my first\nUm first glimpse of of of the of the notion that I had something special to offer as a person who loves the humanities loves all you know I grew up you know I cut my teeth on Melville and Steinbeck and um\nYou know ... ... ... Thomas Hardy great great literature and I always loved that language\nBut I have this knowledge as a scientist so I could try to bridge this wide chasm between\nThe sciences and the humanities and I'm and I'm Still doing that and I feel like I Need to do that because this is one of those divides we were talking about before this very harmful to society and it's harming us badly now because enough people there are so many people who\nWho really have did not get a basic education and you know in chemistry and physics and biology so really don't understand that climate change for example is\nIs a real thing and that these rules we don't get to change that it's going to win it is already winning um people who haven't been trained in the sciences ... just don't even understand that the laws of\nOf nature of chemistry and physics and gravity apply to us we don't get we don't get to cancel them you can you can believe or not believe but you're still going underwater [laughter] so um\nAs as a as a society as a as a as a novelist who is trained as a scientist and one of the things I really like to do is try to explain some of these things in language that's not\nThreatening to people um it's not condescending that's engaging and really sort of asked what do you think about this ...\nWell in the book we get close to a scientist married treat and the neighbor of protecting us from the Eighteenth seventies a woman who despite the odds educated herself and makes a living writing about her research and scientific journals and in popular magazines\nAnd she and Thatcher we're talking about Darwin's theories and the resistance to them and she said quote\nWhen the new sense of old mythology falls away from us we may see with new eyes\nRight she says she she's really she was um she was a real person and I loved the discovery of her or was it was ... was a kind of a lightning rod for this novel for a couple of years\nI I had the structure of it I wanted to write about people facing kind of the end of the world is they knew it this is these huge paradigm shift in two different countries and I knew Darwin\nThat were Darwin's I'm very unsettling new ideas that really disoriented people so I was trying to find some historic person I thought it would be a man or in that time in the United states who was a champion of Darwin to put in my novel to be kind of the\nEpicenter of this this um uh you know this debate this very unsettling on sheltering debate and\nI just ran across the name of Mary Treat and thought who's that nobody's ever written to buy a ... of her it's very hard to find any information about her so I went to the town where she lived and and um\nAnd where her all of her papers are are deposited in this archive in Vineland New Jersey and I discovered this amazing\nWoman who had ... ... led an incredible life um wasn't allowed to go to go to\nCollege in those days I'm so she was self educated but she had the moxie to to write to Darwin to correspond with all the important men of of science of her day and they wrote back because they were very interested in her ...\n... ... very intelligent um observations so she was just one of those rare people who kind of\nDidn't care what people thought of her um and so she she becomes a kind of oracle or a kind of conscience for her neighbor Thatcher who is has been hired to teach in the new high school in Vineland and he really wants to talk to this the students about these really exciting ideas\nI'm ... and Darwin's observation that the laws of nature\nApply to us that we are of the world rather than a in charge of the world\nAnd the principal says that's not happening so he's he's sort of he's in a bind you know he's going to lose his job his his his young bride as saying uh you know we need to fix the house you need to make money get on it and nobody really understands except his neighbor who's saying well look\nThose are your personal circumstances but truth is truth\n... when you come across a historical figure and there are several in the book when you come across someone like a merry treat [noise] what is the process involved after you discover someone like her\n[noise] well um I I went I had as I said I had already constructed\nThe um the sort of the device of this novel um and and I was looking for a character who would then place the novel and I and I auditioned quite a few you know it was like you know tinder swipe left I just you know like a gray nope\nI'm but I'm so so I was I was looking\nFor a character who would fulfill you know the needs of my novel um\nAnd and the ... but in this and when I found her she was just like\nA ... as I said a lightning rod because she was exactly the person I needed she was so interesting really and her place was so interesting because Vineland New Jersey was established in the Eighteen sixties as a utopian community by this I'm\nSelf aggrandizing Meg low maniacal\n... leader who I'm\nA you know sort of named after a named everything after himself and you know I'm One of the first buildings he commissioned in his in his new town was Historical Society so that ah every so that every issue of the newspaper which he wrote an edited himself\nCould be deposited in the archive so it was just it was a fascinating and perfect location to project forward when you found a victim ... when you found to you\nI'm a lecture series and have a lovely philosophical debates and that everybody really kind of everybody\nAnd I'm the kids especially you know the youngest tag who has grown up in a world that never looked very secure to her and so they're all in one\nHouse all feeling different ways about the world and I'm you know my job was to present them all as\nRight in some way right according to the rules that they learned\nWhich I think is the way to begin a conversation with people who are who believe differently from us if you and and and we just we just need some of that right now we just need a lot of it I all I hear is the denigrate nation of\nThe other team which wherever I Am and because I live where I Do in southern Appalachia I'm I'm really\nA and because I work in an industry that is you know ... is urban base because publishing and pretty much all media and entertainment is or is is based in cities\nI hear both sides of this and I'm saying you know what they're really good people on on a on both sides of this divide who have legitimate points\nYou need to listen\nI was wondering since you live in Appalachia what were your thoughts when after the election the national media kind of flocked to that area and just put microphones on people's faces and really gave us a shallow perspective of the people who live there\nYeah they they really didn't flock of you know it was more like you know one person and then another person\nA and another person came in and and and and drove up into the darkest hollow and found that you know the most toothless person who could\nWho could reinforce the stereotype that the urban you know progressive audience wanted to believe in and gave it to them that's not who we are you're I'm here with you you can see I have all my teeth I'm hillbillies look a lot of different ways one of ... is this me\nUm you know presenting presenting decently um we are not all white we are not all ignorant ah we do not all you know ...\nSure we ... what we share is that we live in a region in in the poorest part of the country a very large area that has been\nUm [noise] has been damaged by one extractive industry after another so first the ... the logging barons came and took out all the all the timber a dean outta our forest got rich left\nLeft to mess than the coal Baron came in and took was underneath the mountains got rich and left us with a bigger mess so would you wonder that we're a bit suspicious of outsiders but\nAnother thing we share is that we are tired of being ridiculed as a group of people the culture of of my of of southern Appalachia um is is is\nKind it is generous and you know I live among people who I some of my friends um vote the way I Do some of my friends don't we don't all go to the same church but I don't have among my friends any people who were racist um\nI think there's you know all of us have discomfort with what we don't know ... you know there are there a ... that there is an advantage to living among many kinds of people who are different from you that kind of can\nConvince you that you know that that the stranger the stranger is is probably I'm not going to hurt you but it's a it's a it's a generous in good hearted culture that's really tired of being really being mocked um\nAnd I I have conversations every day with people who agree with me about some things and don't agree with me about some things and what I can promise you is it a ...\nI Know that we have we take information from sources we trust so any conversation that begins with the words you idiot\nIs already over you're not going to convince that person of anything or change that person's mind about anything if you start from the position that I don't respect you know you can't trust me\nToday we're speaking with a best selling novelist Barbara Kingsolver her latest book is called an sheltered and if you'd like to join us the toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to\nFive five if you're in the bay area she will be speaking at book passage today at one at the ferry building in San Francisco and tonight at Copperfield\nAt both really great book stores in Sebastopol at seven and

I mean I couldn't see his house for a minute with okay we were out in the country so you didn't see any buddy's house from ... that's the way he was elected\nThinking Martina let's go next to Lee and Alameda Hi welcome to the show\nThank you for taking my call 'em my part and you know we're we're older we're an excuse me and my partner's recently started writing and I wanted to encourage him and it just flown out of him\nBut you know he's proud to read to me when he went after he's you know written a couple of pages and I know I just\nAnd just let it go just let it out just the story go but I'm Wondering is it and it would you encourage beginning writer to um [noise] to get some you know training from somebody or you just courage to them to let it roll or what what would you do you have any help for him\n[noise] I'm a writer work in so many different ways and writers worked successfully and so many different ways that I Am I'm reluctant to\nTell you that my way is the best way [noise]\nUm I can tell you that I did not go to school to learn to be a writer I didn't START I took a you know a couple of ... English classes in poetry classes whenever I could in college but ... it was only two or three [noise] um I learned to write by reading\nThe kinds of books that I Wish I could have\nWritten and not reading any of the other kind so I'm I I Try to read high\nAnd ah and pay attention to craft when you know when something moves me I think why did I Love the scene so much and I'll go back and re read it so I studied writing from the best you know from Virginia Woolf and Melville and George Eliot\nAnd ah and I as I still do and I read a I I went to a promise you that I read a writers who are alive also I Love reading debut novels which bring me kind of fresh\nUh a fresh look at the world\nSo reading well um is helpful and that's I can say that's always going to help any writer as far as letting it flow I think that's well I I tend to be a very architectural writer I figure out first what it is that I Want this to be about what I wanted the what is the conversation I Want to invite\nMy readers into you know and as I said this was very deliberately a book about\nThe times we're in the paradigm shift like how do we deal with um the under the world I'm as it seems so then I constructed a plot um and this device of the two different century so I had all of this worked out I Do a lot of work in advance kind of\nJust constructing the sort of novel it's going to be and then I um\nThen I I have central casting I ... I except I get to make up a my people and so I I populate my novel with characters who are going to do what I'm what I Need them to do that that's how I work um if somebody just if I many people say oh I just you know solve this character and then I just followed him\nOr to see where he would go if I did that I Would end up last deeply in the woods and you would not want to go there I'm so that doesn't work for me what I can also but maybe it works for your partner I don't know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
