Indian country and far northern California is boy and then when we moved to Los Angeles I began to attend a large public high school year and one day while I was taking a German class anthropologist archeologist showed up on site and said this is an ancient ... village said in a sacred spot\nAnd at the same time the discussions were beginning a university high school about removing the planes Indian warrior as the schools mascot in that discussion eventually became the discussion about eliminating mascots in Los Angeles as a whole\nNew level that was going on I began to wonder what happened to all of the Indians\nYears later when I was a PHD student at Yale one morning I was walking through the wool re route turned which is a spectacular marble room a on which there are the names of\nAll of the Yale men who have fallen and all of the wars since ... existed and I stopped their paws from them and I thought\nWe need something like this for California Indian people and we need something like a kind of Vietnam Memorial for Indian people and obviously I'm not a sculptor or a creator of artistic things like my limbs\nSo as an historian what I tried to do is bring some dignity and some memory of these vast crimes by creating this massive appendix that lists every single killing of the California Indian person that I could find and the numbers are staggering\nA war of extermination will continue to be waged until the Indian race becomes extinct and people in Washington DC in Congress knew about these positions because the very next year\nSenator John wheeler who became our state's governor in Eighteen fifty eight went even further he told his fellow US Senators that California Indians un quote again will be exterminated before the onward march of the white man\nAnd well or argue that and I'll quote again the interest of the white man demands their extinction\nSo this was not the hidden secret proposition the genocide that was going on in California was publicized in the newspapers it was reported in government official letters so people knew in fact I guess you could say was hidden in plain sight\nSo if we come to a place where this is part of public knowledge it I Hope it will be part of a larger public discussion that may in fact lead to monuments days of remembrance\nRadical changes in our states public school curricula and ultimately a public discussion about what this means for the history of California and for the history of native America\nAnd ultimately for the history of the United states\nBenjamin madly is assistant professor of history at UCLA and a historian of\nNative America the United states and genocide in world history his new book is an American genocide the United states and the California Indian catastrophe this is a pre taped ER ... unfortunately they cannot take your phone calls that help you go to our website to read more about this book\nAnd find out how you can get your hands on it it's ... it was a massive undertaking massive massive\n... what did you learn about Native Americans when you were in school\n[noise] well I went to school here in California and unfortunately like many children in this state I didn't learn very much about California Indian people but I had\nThe very fortunate experience of spending much of my childhood and cut a country so I was able to see as a boy the ongoing conflict between natives newcomers over\nPolitical sovereignty over equal treatment before the law um issues like driving while Indian and of course debates over how to care for for us and our rivers and our environment\nSo I guess I had a relatively unusual upbringing that way but my hope is that this book my catalyze a meaningful conversation about doing more\nIn our states curricular standards beyond the fourth grade and the building of a few die or ... or maybe a model mission made out of sugar cute\nAs an academic how do you go about changing the curriculum to include this information\nWell the issue of genocide in California during this period obviously poses explosive political economic and educational questions not just for the state of California but for California's tribes but it's a hundred and ten federally recognized tribes and the Seventy plus\nCommunities that are not federally recognized as well as individual California Indians and because the ramifications are so tightly connected to Indian experiences here\nI think that it's really up to indigenous people California Indians not academics like me to set the agenda for what are the most important issues and what the best way forward is\n[noise] it seems like there's so much awareness raising around black lives matter of course\nYou know there's that protest at the ... the kind of access pipeline Standing Rock North Dakota a lot more bucks are coming out about Native Americans just in the last two years have been so many things happening it seems like we're at a point where\nWe are starting this conversation that question as well be the concrete changes\nWe obviously have a long way to go here in the United states on the issue of race relations some political candidates may wish to obfuscate and hide from that fact\nBut I think these are very very real crucial issue um the Dakota access pipeline issues reveals how far we have to go to a very difficult for me to imagine\nAttack dogs and and private security officers attacking women and children peaceful protesters simply protesting for the protection of a basic necessities of life that is clean water\nProtesting for the basic human dignity not to have the remains of their ancestors dug up and desecrated and yet these peaceful protesters including women and children and elders were set upon by private security contractors and attack dogs\nIt's hard to imagine that happening to euro Americans in this day and age but clearly it's a major problems still and it's a problem that academics I think are increasingly aware of\nAnd in our work as historians of you know I and others I think hope too\nOf these patterns of exploitation and abuse and the fundamental injustice of a political system but largely denies American indian people even today full equal access an equal opportunity before the law\nAnd since we're talking about this oil pipeline I just want to mention one fat the PBS NewsHour reported that but I have really not heard it anywhere else the three point eight billion dollar Dakota Access pipeline original path\nCross the Missouri River north of Bismarck which is a city that's Ninety percent white but when concerns were raised about a potential oil spill their the pipeline was re routed south to go under the river next to the Standing Rock reservation and the Missouri River as the tribes primary source of drinking water\nNow as a journalist I think that this information should be included in every story unfortunately it's not [noise]\nYes I I think that um it's quite clear that Standing Rock community was targeted because they probably thought that they would not resist a and a show of support has been overwhelming a I Believe that over two hundred and fifty American indian communities\nHave sent representatives there are some of our own UCLA indigenous community members were recently there as part of the protests and there is a public consciousness about this beyond Indian country\nMultiple cities a city councils have passed resolutions supporting the Standing Rock community and taking a stance against the pipeline in fact I Believe\nSo major metropolitan areas like Seattle or that have stood up against us\nBefore we got a break can you talk a little bit more about your experiences visiting Native Americans today because I Would venture to guess that the majority of the population has never been to an Indian reservation and I was visiting Montana back in two thousand five\nRight outside of Glacier National park with a black feet reservation and in two thousand five this tribe finally got paved roads and mailboxes and most people didn't believe me when I told them this but this is the reality that so many people who live on Indian reservations face today\nWell it's a very shameful part of our past but it's also very shameful part of our future and our president unless we take action to change things there are American indian community still in this country who do not have access to clean running water in their homes\nAh California's Indian communities are some of the poorest communities in California or the town in which I grew up happy camp is one of the highest rates of welfare of any established\nTown or city in the entire state\nUh that said\nCalifornia Indian people are at the same time undergoing a tremendous renaissance\nThere is a great deal of cultural renewal happening uh there are grammar books being written languages are being revitalized ceremonies are coming back\nAnd people are engaging increasing with the federal government to give you one example the U.S Forest Service now employs some California Indian people to help manage our state's forest\nUsing old uh practiced proven a methods of fire based land management\nUm so when I ...\nThis uh amount of pain and trauma but at the same time I see\nAn amazing resilience um and when you think about how people survived this genocide\nIt is really incredible people survived against almost impossible ... we saw an eighty percent plus population decrease during the years that I describe in this book\nSo some state and federal decision makers also if you're guilty of another crime enumerated by the convention and that is the crime of imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group\nFinally and this is also very important argument in the book the state of California\nSlave raiders and federal officials were all involved in another crime enumerated by the convention and that was the crime of forcibly transferring children of the group to another group and the numbers are staggering\nScholars estimate that three thousand four thousand or more California Indian children suffer these kinds of force transfers by breaking up families and communities force removals constituted another act of imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group to in effect\nState legalized abduction and enslavement of Indian use\nFlavors exploited the indentured laws there on the books and federal officials than prevented the United States Army officers and their troops in California from intervening to protect the victims so rape and others\nKind of genocidal crime that we see perpetrated again and again and again in California under us through\n[noise] and why it found that has science perspective\nIs it so important to use the word genocide\nYou write that exceptional asked interpretations of us history which suggest that the United states it's fundamentally unlike other countries losing ... when researchers compared to California experience to other genocides and place it with our global framework\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's at stake\nOr one of the questions is a question of public acknowledgement or apology the kinds of things that presidents Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush did in the Nineteen eighties\nTo acknowledge the relocation in a tournament of some one hundred and twenty thousand Japanese Americans by the way many of whom were California citizens during the second World War\nA connection to that is immediate you think of reparations they're important subordinate issue\nSo if we call it genocide we have to ask should state and federal officials offer compensation should they offer compensation along the lines of the more than one point six billion dollars that Congress has now paid out over eighty two thousand obese Japanese Americans in their heirs\nAnother question we might want to consider is my California in officials a decrease or altogether eliminate their cut California Indians annual gaming revenues and these are substantial by the way California Indian gaming are\nGenerated over seven point three billion dollars of income two thousand fourteen um\nShould the state or federal government agencies returned control to California's Indian communities\nOf state or federal lands where these genocidal events took place for example you know we have over three hundred documented massacres sites throughout the state of California and many of these sites are now on state or federal land\nA you know should the state and federal governments stopped commemorating the supporters and perpetrators of this genocide people like Peter Burnett who I mentioned before a kit Carson and John C. Freemont who\nDirectly perpetrated mass murderer or a Stanford who helped to fund one of the major killing campaigns and then of course as we mentioned before will these events we called them genocide\nNow join other genocides the Armenian Genocide the Holocaust in the states public school curricula and in our public discourse\nThey ask why you know a ... those are sort of the practical considerations and again I think it's really for California Indian communities and individuals to figure out which of those issues they think are the most important and that they want to lead with but I can tell you\nWe're my thinking comes from as an historian and as a human being passionately concern with studying this I devoted the better part of a decade of my life to this project the first thing that that it you know it just comes from heart is decency\nEven long after the people are gone I think it's it's a decent some basic decency to preserve the truth of what happened to them not only so that their memory can be honored but so that the repetition\nOf similar genocidal crimes can be deterred\nSo the second thing that I think of his justice justice\nBanished we document and tell the stories of the crimes that they and their supporters have in our state's case so successfully concealed denied and suppressed and finally as an historian\nVeracity demands at least for me that we acknowledge that state sponsored catastrophe in all of its buried aspects and all of its causes you to better understand formative events\nIn both the history of the state of California and the United states in order to better understand where we are today and how we got here\nToday I'm sticking with Benjamin madly author of an American genocide the United states and the California Indian catastrophe\nBenjamin as assistant professor of history at UCLA and a historian of native America the United states and genocide in world history as he said he spent a decade working on this massive book\nHe writes the story of the California Indian catastrophe is almost an relenting league program which helps to explain why relatively little has been written about it at least compared\nTo other genocides\nThis is a pre taped your calls so unfortunately we cannot take your phone calls that you can find out more about this important book at your call radio\nDot O. R. G.\nAs you said Benjamin ... it's got to take Native Americans to really make these changes\nAnd you know with the death of my grandparents recently I Can't help but think about what role I should play and trying to to do this to have to raise awareness about these issues and I think a lot about the fact that\nYou know when you look at black lives matter there are a lot of prominent African Americans who write about these issues are in the media on a regular basis\nSame goes for Jews the same does not go for Native Americans I just found this graphic looking at the employees of National Public radio I mean I work for an NPR affiliate were not included\nBut at NPR\nThere are zero Native Americans and when I went to college I think I was the only Native American to the fact of the matter is Native Americans still do not have prominent positions in society to raise awareness about these issues [noise]\nThat part of the problem yes [laughter] um [laughter] well you know as an educator I I think about the educational sphere and it's quite a glaring issue for\nThe University of California system the indigenous people in our states a university system are dramatically underrepresented not only among faculty but among students as well\nAnd uh American indian students struggle with a lot of issues and I'm One of the sad reality is is that American Indians in the UC system have the lowest rate of graduation of any group that they use these track\nI'm very fortunate to be at UCLA and to be chair of a thriving American indian studies program here we are\nUnusual in that we have a master's degree in American indian studies we have a major in a minor in American indian studies so we have a thriving American indian studies center and or even an American Indian studies library\nIt's one of the reasons that I came here wow uh but my my hope is that we could have the same type of institutional development at all\nLiving in California in fact than in any other state in the ...\nNot only a hundred and fifty thousand California Indian people\nFrom a hundred and ten federally recognized tribes in Seventy unrecognized tribes but also people from hundreds of different American communities both ways in and beyond the United states\nSo one of the beginnings that we have to address is\nEqual access for Native American people in our universities uh in order to uh develop more leaders\n[noise] how did this come about I mean who pushed for an American Indian studies program who pushed for the library how did this happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "08"}
