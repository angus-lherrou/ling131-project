Ali welcome back to the show\nI think is Robin\nHi thank you so much for joining us alley we're also joined by ... go Paul in award winning freelance journalist and author of the book no good men among the living America the Taliban and the war through Afghan eyes high end on welcome to the show\nOr they're driving thank you both so much for joining us\nWell as it was so many important issues there being overshadowed by what's happening in the United states\nEm Ali Ali we've had you on many times to talk about what's happening on the ground in Kabul and Afghanistan and I'm sure a lot of people don't know that more than ten thousand civilians were killed last year and that number is expected to be even higher this year\nFirst off why are these numbers so high\nThe numbers are so high because I mean it's ten thousand killed and injured uh but the numbers are alive for a number of for a variety of reasons\nOne is that the a group including the poll the bond Indonesia are increasingly targeting urban Center for the call bill and in ...\nI'm also you know we have to remember that there are all ... called by\nA airstrike both born a novel on 'em and move towards the ... in the sense that these opposition groups really want to show their power by targeting the um you know very ah populated urban centers\nI'm not really were leaving for ... for the ...\nAnd ... what would you add\nA year and uncovered other than the escalation of the carpet from the American side I'm going to last year to ah the intensity and the pace of airstrikes or increase greatly\nA particularly in rural areas like Holden ... and ... is a reported I'm Anders incidents that I hear about from ...\nOr ... killed or injured or people that are are not to make it into the into the media\nCan you elaborate on that ... I mean we ... the a P reports that the Afghan war is costing taxpayers forty five billion dollars a year what exactly is the American presence in Afghanistan like today\nThere are um some troops on the ground um horses and including groups are that are partnered with the Afghan forces are often [noise] but I think more more important than God's presence is the fact that the U.S search would\nNow he houses in Dubai and keep a you know have bank accounts with millions and millions of dollars um while their fellow countrymen are starving or have you know basic services and ... and it I think it it\nIt also was something that I'm not into the conflict because you have this sense that there's a small group of people who\nIn which themselves extraordinary are Americans and Afghans are the way who can reach religious was extraordinarily at the expense of the majority of often and certainly that can message that the Taliban and it can it can be restored strong certainly I'm sort of\nTry to promote saying that they are the ones who are protecting against the sort of been out to sort of corruption\nAnd it and non can you tell us who are making these decisions when it comes to doling out this money I mean what what what what are the biggest difference is between how that worked under Obama and how it's working under Trump\nI mean there really aren't that many different is obviously a you know there's a question of scale um you know sometimes different missions of ruptured up the amount of money or or brought it back down but the very dynamic this fundamental logic of how money is spent has been mostly the same between\nBush or Obama and Trump which is that most of the money is spent on military not on on the Mediterranean efforts most of the money is spent in sort of cascades of sub contracting so you know you want to go build a road somewhere that got us out you don't give that money directly to walk on the road you subcontracted to\nAmerican corporations usually it's who them for contracted out and so on down the chain until eventually it gets to some small company I've gone to style and there's no oversight or what they do with that money that that model of spending money has been basically in place since two thousand and one has been really no change from and you're from India\nComments about Afghanistan and has been Seventeen years since the United states invaded that country\nJust last year more than ten thousand Afghan civilians were either killed or injured that number is expected to be even higher this year the a P recently had a fairly short piece about how the Afghan war is costing the United states taxpayers forty five billion a year and a non go Paul says most of that money is spent on\nMilitary military contractors\nYou can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five\nFive you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G. and non to go Paul is author of no good men among the living America the Taliban and the war through Afghan eyes ... as a freelance journalist based in Kabul\nAccording to brown university's cost of war project a hundred and four thousand people have been killed in Afghanistan since two thousand one thirty one thousand have been civilians an additional forty one thousand civilians have been injured since two thousand and one\nI only do those numbers sound about right to you and what the research you've done\n[noise] um no those are the problem with those numbers is that they need to be correct uh one of the problems in and I think on on can\nTalk to the news that we'd have an issue here with her for it and you know the government everyday poll\nA updates and like when we come with many militants because of my age because when I was on\n'em and the truth the because of the areas there in\nUh because of one they take it very difficult to actually a festival situation and find out who was killed 'em so in terms of civilian casualties that number and you know at the government always an ISIS is quiet about civilian casualties that have several airstrikes\nIn the north and the east of the country or in the last month or so but the one documented a and did as a result of civilian casualties and those who never get drugs I'm for this this is a major issue where we're constantly be told you know the the\n... or a military people were killed but there's really no way to prove that and when you go to many problems because I've been you know they say the the issue is for instance like if I if I if I Want to be with people you know who the government might commit\nAnd uh my my uh quite a button\nAnd you know I Would go out and kill kill kill them that in fact it would likely taught me given in combating through um so so this is precisely the issues that we don't have the numbers and we're just called and told a number of fighters or whatever\nAnd and and on so human Rights Watch found as Ali just said that the Afghan government has no capacity to investigate civilian casualties and according to reports U.S forces downsize civilian casualties so so what would you add I mean how how do we know what the real numbers are\nMarried with all due to the um it's very hard to say what the numbers are ah you know done studies on civilian casualty estimates and other countries and he's been in places that are much more developed a it's it's very hard to do and you know gone to started where large parts of the country side\nOf the reasons you mentioned are really under developed or or impoverished it's very hard to get there or the Taliban are not from your to driller starting off earlier created a better research or your government certainly isn't\nA friendly either or to those or it could use it makes it very difficult I mean whether it's a hundred thousand or Georgia does and I don't know\nOur number of people have been killed and injured and it's\nProbably far greater than most Americans couldn't even begin to realize\nWhat about drone strikes over the years have been such a good coverage of drone strikes human rights watch between November twenty Seventeen in April of this year\nInterviewed forty two civilian airstrike victims and witnesses um ... what can you tell us about drone strikes how often do they happen and who's carrying them out\nWell in a drone strike happened a by I think what's important to point out is a lot of the bombings just old fashioned ... you know a piloted aircraft and you know where you see drone strikes are drones\nI'm making up the majority of the strikes as places like Fox dog where the U.S legally use not able to fly I'm sort of ... manned aircraft\nBut not far from the foods in some respects very old fashioned into central they're just using there's all sorts of things that we are with pilots and from the point of view\nOf those wrong the receiving end uh of course it doesn't really make a difference or whether they're a remotely controlled or a\nPilot or the polar either way there's a lot of airstrikes and logs but anyway the drone strikes mostly would be carried out by the United states\nAli what would you add\nI'm a ... with the way back to our problem I'm Talking about because I have a you know people who've disarmed and control on strike\nAnd this is not to mention that I Would go to them and I was single can get the government's competent to my school um society activists journalists the media and they would say no because there's very little follow through on it and when you have to try and report on them\nAli I'm ... I'm Sorry we're having we're having a hard time again with your connection out well try to get a clear connection were connecting with ... a freelance journalist based in Kabul, Afghanistan\nUm which I think it's really important you talked to a journalist has actually in Afghanistan but sometimes that means that we have a line that's unpredictable so hopefully we'll try to get a better line for Ali\nAnd ... ... let's talk about what it means to be a journalist in Afghanistan and hopefully we can reconnect with I'll leave us a better number Thirteen journalists have been killed in Afghanistan and just this year so what is it like for you\nWhen you report in Afghanistan are you able to move freely or or what does that like\nA lot for your able to move freely but a lot of fun is what is the most\nDangerous countries in the world to be a journalist but less so for me as an American politics it's much more dangerous for off on journalists that I think majority of those who've been\nKilled or wounded were ... um that's that's where the real dangers and I think it's in part because often journalists\nDo have a pre structural productions or the or a foreign correspondent might hug 'em you know it's interesting 'cause uh some you have a lot of security protocols in place sometimes those particles defer to our local national or if you're a Florida\nI'm In many cases the insurgents are less likely to kill a foreign journalist because they see them as a\nSource of potential ransom ah whereas for obvious reasons they won't see that for a local journalists were all these reasons I think he's local journalists talk on journalists who are really the ones who are a threat\nAnd Ali are you back with us\nOkay hopefully we have a better line sorry about that Ali and we were just talking about the difficulty and the danger involved and being\nUm so the difficulties come in several forms on the one hand you do have an increase in the ... and the so called lawyers forces are targeting journalists to the point where they will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the full Senate and joining us now is well bunch an award winning journalist national columnist for the Philadelphia daily news and author of the political blog attitude\nOh\nOkay sorry we just lost well bunch I'm Wondering if we got any breaking news just in the last forty minutes here's what's happening this morning Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski voted against sending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate\nAnd a number of reporters say that if she voted no this morning that probably means she's going to vote now again\nSenator Jeff flake just announced about half hour ago that unless something big happens he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh and we're expecting an announcement from Susan Collins\nAt noon Pacific and joining us now is well bunch Hi welcome to the show high that Seventy back\nGreat to have you did anything breaking the last forty minutes that we need to know about\nNot that I'm aware of up in a monitor from that from a closely but I think you described\nAre the days two biggest development so far which is the a no vote from Lisa Murkowski which apparently a and this is very interesting apparently it was\nKind of spontaneous I mean she but she really was undecided are waving until she actually got onto the Senate for this morning in a voted no ah I'm On the closure wrote but also will although no tomorrow so uh uh that basically means that a\nFew of the other three way Rene votes would ah\nAlso have to vote no I'm a is mentioned the looks pretty much like Jeff Flake from Arizona who's one of those three is a yes vote or and so I I think really\nAre I think everyone agrees with this point they're probably whatever season Collins does at three o'clock this afternoon a ah eastern time a nice talking to the Pacific uh\nUh is going to uh you know really kind of beat that aside or because I think I think Joe Manchin in such a tough spot that he's going to I think he would like to vote for a cabin on a I think he doesn't want to be the deciding vote does so if you can call a\nJoined so you can support him and he wouldn't be deciding vote anyway so\nUh so I think that I think I think the whole ball game is going to be what happened uh later today Susan Collins\nHuh [noise] well and you know so much of that as well you could say as a result of is thousands and thousands of women and men are flocking to Washington DC from across the country including Alaska\nAnd you wrote about some of the women who talk to you know basically told Jeff Flake do the right thing in the elevator I mean sharing their sexual assault story for the first time on national television ... can you talk about how that has been coverage I mean if even as we speak their activist and the Senate and the Capitol\nYeah I mean frankly I mean to be honest I kind of wish there were\nAlmost more coverage I mean I thought yesterday afternoon you had this incredibly powerful moment when\nA protestors who were mostly but not exclusively women are flooded the was the hearts and an office building one of the one of the main office buildings are in the capital of complex and basically shut it down because there were\nSo many of them they just sort of the entire building and then finally I Believe the police arrested about three hundred of them including a couple of celebrities like a human Schumer hum medium ...\nSo I'm a ... but but I I was surprised that was not more coverage of the because I I I think you're absolutely right I think I think I think people raising their voices\nA woman's decision to speak out or you know that a doctor Christine Blasey Ford if it hurts you not\nTo raise their voices we wouldn't be here at this point uh but that but then so many others and and and you know that that did the uh two women or a Maria Gallagher and Anna Maria um trailer who spoke out in the elevator just like a ... you could see Jeff Flake space\nOr in the in the community room after that you could tell that encounter at an influence on them and and like you said\nYou know uh I'm pretty sure that Lisa Murkowski dramatic decision today\nWas usually influenced by the fact that you spend a lot of time yesterday meeting with survivors of sexual assault that uh uh apparently she had very long meetings with these people who'd come from Alaska\nTo tell their stories and she was very moved by them and I think that's probably what influenced her vote in the end so I'm a ... that's been a huge part of the story and and I I think it can't\nBe it'd be highlighted enough because\nYou know that's been a bigger issue and and the whole from the era you know can I make a difference you know if I if I speak out or if I if I protest or if I\nYou know write an op ed or if I Do anything you know they're going to make a difference and you know we're seeing we're seeing specific instances where in the capital confirmation fight we can look at it and you can say yes absolutely it's making a difference and\nI Believe it last Anna Maria ... who said that her father she sent a text to her father saying you're going to find out about this on national news but don't worry I'm okay\nI think both I think both of them you know there there were just bizarre position where they basically told Senator Jeff flake about their sexual assault before they told their own family members um\nIt's really amazing but you know well we've been doing shows last week we checked breaks during the hearings and then yesterday me up in the lines and we heard from one man after my man I'm One man con last week and sharing their stories for the first time ever so they're just\nGonna ask you how do you think the media are reporting on ... and then being sensitive enough not to play Trump mocking lousy foreign on a loop over and over again\n[noise] um\nWell sensitivity isn't isn't isn't really the media is strong point especially when you know when politics takes over a you know I mean I think\nI think I think that tape that you just mentioned the Trump and and also\nThe large crowd behind from sharing a you know when he mocked or a sexual assault survivor and I just thought that was a special low point in American history but um you know I I think I think on the whole you know I I I'm I'm both a critic of the media in at\nThe center of the media and and I'm a member of the movie or a\nIn an eye on when it comes to the need to but I think I think on the whole the media has been more positive I mean I think uh I I think you have to acknowledge that uh the me too movement might not have started the way it did it not been for the workable supporters like like the New York times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein story\nA ... and certainly Ronan Farrow in and and more recently working with Jane Eyre about her but I'm\nA you know many of these instances have come to light a you know in in the in the cabinet or instance a journalist played a key role you know both Washington Post\nJournalist to you know worked with Dr Palese for it to get her story out and then and then more recently the uh uh the the the the New Yorker telling the story of of uh the the uh second accuser yell\nSo uh I'm Deborah Ramirez so I'm a so I I think [laughter]\nHow they handle this but I think I think on the whole I think the media that have been a positive and that's a fair for the most part\n[noise] yesterday we saw Orrin Hatch waving off of protesters demanding to speak with hand by saying quote grow up I mean a lot of people I feel that so much at stake that if they need to get into an elevator and talk to someone and tell their stories and that's what they need to do\nThe most that's one of the fascinating things about this I mean I mean it cuts both ways because over what I've been reading a lot last couple of days and you've probably seen this as well is that people are saying that conservatives that\nYou know in in the Republican Party and the right wing he's energized by the vehemence with which people on the left are protesting Kavanaugh you know in other words a you know when when when people",
