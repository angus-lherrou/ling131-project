this is your call\nWe only have twelve years to steer the planet away from climate disaster according to a new report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change that is twelve years\nAccording to the report we need to make rapid and far reaching changes in order to keep the earth's temperature from rising more than one point five degrees\nOn yesterday's show we talked about the report and how the climate deniers and the White House ignore and diminished scientific research\nWell thankfully young people are taking matters into their own hands and today we are speaking with three of the eight winners of this year's Brower used awards which honors young leaders and the environmental movement today's you use the will inherit a planet shaped by current policy [noise]\nSo what are their top priorities and how can we support them today we are joined by Valerie content guy a Twenty one year old from Long Beach California who cofounded the environmentalist of color collective\nAt UCLA her work with the collective challenges mainstream environmentalists them to include the narratives of communities and people of color\nValerie is also a carbon neutrality

joins us in Studio type thank you for coming in Hi thank you for having me it's great to have you\nWere also joined by Rosa Whipple a Seventeen year old from Minnesota who is fighting the line three

rather be great to have you\nAnd ... as a Seventeen year old from Utah who helped craft and pass the Utah climate resolution the first of its kind and they traditionally conservative state ... is also co founder of the Utah youth environmental solutions a youth led group that engages with their community on environmental issues\nAnd she was an organizer for the Utah people's climate march and twenty sixteen and ... also joins us in Studio thank you for coming in they see some well thank you all it's great to have you have to say this show is one of the most inspiring we do every year especially this year\nCongratulations on all the great work that you do I want to start off by asking you I was reading about all the work you do and [laughter]\nJust wondering what is it like to be a young person at this time\nI you know not only with the climate deniers and the White House but there's just so much information out there and it's it's more difficult than ever to get into college everything is more expensive\nI'm Valerie speaking about ... you know just environmental issues first off what is it like for you to be a young active person in this climate\nIt's definitely scary at times there's a lot of deniers out there as you said but what gives me hope is learning about the efforts that other young people are making towards this movement especially in my younger brother and sister who are back in Long Beach they're learning more and more about what climate change is doing to affect\nTheir lives every day and I think\nWorking with other young people is what gives me the most hope\nWe're the people every day to have to you know fight this and that had been fighting is um you know we are the people that do have the answers to how to stop this because we had been five minutes for so long you know um if you start listening to the indigenous people love this country you know I really believe that we could stop climate change because we have been taking care of this land and nurturing it\nFor so long you know we know exactly you know what berries to pick and everything and we know so much about this land to to save it um and I think listening to people of color indigenous people were really you know help savers\n[noise] ... [noise] yeah I agree with that Valerie and in a row said I think environmental justice means giving the power back to the people who are most affected by it\nUm I think traditionally you know because you know we live in a racist country you live in a sex this country I think all of 'em by default a lot of the impacts that we experience will be racist and sexist and homophobic\nUm and so it means combating all their systems all at once and I think that um gives a lot of opportunity for the climate movement to talk about other areas um activism\nAnd you're Seventeen are you in high school yes I'm a senior year senior and in your school do you talk about these issues are you talking about environmental issues and and what city in Utah do you live in I live in Salt Lake City okay settling um yeah in school I think it's\nHard um and to talk about these problems in school especially since\nI think in Utah specially we live in a pretty hostile environment when it comes like for environmentalists are are represented as are the ones who have called us you know rock liquors in tree huggers um and so rock liquor yes they called us rock liquor is when we confronted them about their conflict of interests\nThat also that you know environmental is um only care about you know like\nI don't know that like that we only ... pub trees but you know that's something important but it also doesn't talk about the big picture um and so part of what I'm doing is trying to talk about other areas um like reproductive justice and connecting it to environmental justice um 'cause I think that is the best way to introduce these concepts\nIn Utah do you have the kinds of climate deniers that we're seeing in the White House I mean are they pretty extreme\nFor sure [laughter] yeah I mean in the legislature um when I first\nTestified I testified you know as a Muslim American and said you know as part of my faith to be a good steward of the land um and one of the representative you know kind of turned around and said well you know I think you know because God gave us all these resources that we should be using these\nSo um yeah I think that you know we kind of share a lot of different things and I'm In Utah there is a really big emphasis on\nUm the economy and so with everything that we have to do we have to tie it back into like monetary resources and and making sure that we include that um when you know really the economy and environment should be the same thing not enough to different things\nSo how did you all go about crafting and passing the Utah climate resolution at a time when these politicians are calling you rock liquor mhm yeah I mean um it was it was interesting\nBecause we I mean I grew up with certain students from sudden northern Utah gave me um approached a bunch of legislators they had drafted this this piece of legislation in up up and\nI'm approached a bunch of legislators and asked if they'd be linked to sponsor it and a lot of them turned us away not because they didn't want to help us out because they didn't think that you should be participating in this process\nUm and when we initially finally got we got a sponsor and we were denied a hearing in the Senate a committee they because they hadn't climate change language in it and so we\nThen held her own hearing 'em and through that um we got you know it was kind of goes around in circles but the second year we spent hours and hours and hours at night crafting our message is based on their representatives passed responses to our legislation\nUm any kind of you know had Republican representative think that they had no by and into the language of the resolution um there's definitely putting a lot of hard work and how to sacrifice a lot of things but I think the ultimate goal is to just get it through\nWow congratulations things you ... a Seventeen year old from Utah who helped craft and pass the Utah climate resolution the first of its kind in a traditionally conservative state so we were hearing about the politics and Utah ... what are the politics like in Minnesota on these issues right um\nYou know Minnesota is definitely a more liberal state um but definitely only in the city um you know when you're outside the city and the more rural\nYou know countryside um it's definitely more Republican you definitely see more Trump signs um which also means that there are a lot of climate change deniers when you're outside the city um you know inside the city if you just stay in your bubble it's really easy to put things that you know everyone\nUm believe that climate change is happening and everyone knows about it um but if you go inside your bubble and you start realizing that not everybody realizes that this was happening um\nAnd especially you know in these communities that are more rural and in the countryside it's actually ... changes happening there ... and the city um and they don't even recognize it and they you know don't actually know the reasons why not also is what a part of what I Do is I'm trying to educate the these communities and trying to educate the tribal communities that are also not in the city\nUm that don't really understand what's happening and they have nobody to teach them because you know in our school system they don't teach about this um there's no way really to learn unless you look on line and do a lot of research yourself\nEducate these people because this is really important and they need to know how to combat this and what they can do are you also\nSenior yes and I ... and I thought I was going to ask you the same question do you talk about these issues in school but it sounds like you don't\nWrite um you know usually in our science classes or in any classes that I have we don't talk about climate change\n'em at all um there's earth clubs but even in these er clubs they don't talk about climate change 'em and so I definitely do try to bring it up and a lot of people you know in my school is no the kind of work that I Do and call me the protester 'em and things like that yeah like the tree hugger and things like that\nUm some definitely known for doing this work but I definitely don't think that it's taken seriously um\nYou know especially with all these movements that are happening a lot of people just don't want I don't quite understand it's hard um especially when a lot of these teachers do come from the ... the rural areas and they don't actually understand as well what climate like climate change ... actually is\nAnd where in Minnesota do you live where I live in St Paul in St Paul okay and so can you talk a little bit of Valerie was talking about how communities of color and low income communities\nAround Long Beach are affected by pollution and a lot of people have asthma I mean your parents said don't go outside because they're afraid he would get asthma right so I really had as you already had\nAsthma and so can you talk about some of the communities and Minnesota and how they're affected\nRight that's the only um pollution is definitely a big thing in our city on this definitely a lot of air pollution um you know many people in the city don't even know what the stars look like because you can't see them my city um you know and a lot of people have never seen any of this of this of this kind of stuff and have never even been outside the city to even see these things\nUm and so definitely in communities of color like cancer is very real and ... especially in these tribal communities um you know right where these right where they put these pipelines that's especially where this cancer is happening\nA lot of these um deformities this is happening because a lot of um the pollution that comes from these factories and his pipelines those directly into our water source um ... and everyone drinking all all these pollutants and things like that and people are getting cancer and all and all of these I'm\nReally bad stuff is going through bodies um and you know people are seeing the effects right now\n... rose with all of a Seventeen year old from Minnesota who is fighting the line three pipeline\nValerie content guy is a Twenty one year old from Long Beach who cofounded the environmentalist of color collected at UCLA and ... as a Seventeen year old from Utah who helped craft and pass the Utah climate resolution the first of its kind in a traditionally conservative state\nRoads Valerie and ... are three of this year's eight ... award winners the bribery usa words honors young leaders in the environmental movement\nAnd we love doing the show it's a very inspiring if you have any questions or comments for our guest you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot org\nIf you're on Facebook head over to the KLW Facebook page where you can see all three winners in Studio ... Valerie so you live in California and you went to high school in California did you talk at all about these issues in school yeah I\nThey're really great thing about being in Los Angeles and California in general is that there aren't as many climate deniers\nAnd there's one thing to accept the fact that climate change is real and then it's another thing to take real climate action so our state is obviously a well known for our climate leadership\nThat the same time there's so many problems that are still happening around our state and a lot of communities are being impacted from ...\nWell when we think about climate change in California we think about are one hundred percent renewable energy called Governor Brown just passed um the goal to go one hundred percent renewable energy by twenty forty five\nBut there are still oil projects happening in California in his time in office he's approved Martin twenty thousand oil and gas permits and that's different from reaching are one hundred percent renewable energy goals there's that distinct difference so\nTo give us an update on the fight because they're\nSo like you said social media if you look on social media there's so much on line three but if you look in the mainstream media there's not that much\nRight definitely um you know it's really hard to get this out there because there are a lot of people that believe that we need oil and not pipelines are necessary for you know our economy and for people to thrive in living used cars um but you know we're definitely against that um and\nI was in a Fisher intervene or I'm\nIn the permitting process for with this for the pipeline was um twelve or their you climb intervene as we were the first I'm using the country's ever intervene in the pipeline process of this kind um and so in June um the public utilities commission of Minnesota approve the pipeline approved the permits that were needed for it I'm so right now\nThey are ... start building in\nNext summer I'm uh twenty Nineteen and they've already started clear cutting trees um and so right now you know we aren't giving up hope are still fighting this and we're going to fight this until the very end because you know we can't let this go through no matter what happens\nLike standing around people are putting their bodies on the line for them right in right will are still fighting sense\nBut ... ... euros talked about going to Standing Rock when she was just Fifteen and like so many people she was shocked when she saw the video of the the the the spray when it was so cold and then the dogs and the bites\nAnd I just wonder I'm Valerie how are you affected by what you saw at Standing Rock\nWhen I was looking through social media and seeing all of the post from my friends and people that\nI knew um I\nWas shocked I did I didn't think about a movement like this could get so big and I'm so happy that it did because it really\nPut into light what is going on right now and that we need to keep on pushing for these movements because just the fact that that this one movement can get so big it really shows like how much power people have when they stand together and fight for the same collective\nGoal did you know much about indigenous activism or indigenous rights before Standing Rock I was in high school at the time so I\nDidn't really know about too much until Standing Rock occurred and that's what really blew everything up for me and made me more aware that I Need to stay educated and keep on I'm learning about different things that are going on to\nThe country and what about ... [noise] yeah I mean in our history classes we don't really learn about a indigenous history at all and so\nStanding Rock was the first time we're um I really recognized the activists activism not indigenous people have um Don's ever since the founding and before the founding of the country um and Standing Rock um showed me I guess the resiliency of the indigenous\nPeople also um just how awful the U. S. government isn't always has been to they didn't indigenous people and how necessary it is to included an indigenous people and um our fight all over the world what do you learn in history class about indigenous history and\nI'm a if misinformation for sure um we learned that the trail of tears um didn't really happen and not think there's enough people gave up their land because the settlers asked them to um when we\nKnow that you know they didn't ask at all they just took it and I'm committed genocide while I'm not I mean you're Seventeen so that was just recently that you learned this or that yeah that yeah I mean yeah and you were told this ... [noise] yeah al yeah education system definitely need to says anyone speak out in class and say\nNow that we're in high school yeah yeah um I think especially with social media we know that that isn't misinformation but we've been also learning this stuff since we were\nReally really young since elementary school and I think in middle school was the first time where we started to learn that you know the stuff isn't true in high school now we know that um [noise] it's not but definitely teachers don't teach it that way anymore [noise] what about you Valerie [noise] yeah\nI agree ...\nDidn't really ... I went to a Catholic school actually\nSo we talked about how the missions were the pinnacle of like ... settler and colonization so\nWe saw indigenous tribes and people as something that we were they were helping 'em these settlers to grow a civilization when that was actually not true at all and the fact that I'm learning so much more now\nIt's really important to have an education reform on what is actually going on because younger people should know about what is really happening\nAnd I just want to add real quick at I'm In Utah we learn specifically on Utah and history um\nAs refugees and founded the state and that's not true there are people before the Mormon missionaries and so it's just reframing not history and making sure that people recognize that Mormons were the first people in that state or that area mhm ...\nWe have so much work to do was newly yeah definitely what do I mean let it goes through your mind when you hear this\nRight you know will you know my grandpa went to boarding school and he was ... and then he had his his hair cut off and you couldn't speak his language and you can learn is culture um\nYou know and I grew up learning this you know I I grew up going to say one young group you know learning my language\nI'm In your knowing that I Am the ... the I'm ho chunk and I'm here my people are still here [noise] um but then I go to school and I learn these things and I hear Columbus came here and founded this country um you know I grew up knowing that he raped you know hundreds of women in in print print and Puerto Rico\nI'm In that he killed thousands of people um and he wasn't you know in the first person that came here you know there are people who got here\nAnd you know now today you know Native Americans are less than one percent of this country's population you know I'm In you know we're still being oppressed you know we live on reservations where there aren't even there isn't even drinking water you know we don't have access to clean drinking water reliving as if we are in a third world country\nAnd nobody in this country even knows that we still exist you know we're we're dying in this country is still trying to kill us off\nAnd it's really hard to to go to school on line this but also try to be indigenous and try to represent your culture when nobody even knows who you are ...\nAnd it's also I mean for you you know hearing from ah Michigan and Valerie and then almost feeling like okay I have to explain this again [laughter] I mean this is all it's a lot\nRight right oh it definitely is I mean to say we're still here and this is what happened to my grandparents right and this is the land that they were removed from I mean it's a lot to\nHave oh it's really hard you know like we have sports teams named after us\nYou know we have the Washington Redskins you know that name Redskins comes from when they would scout bus and the blow to be running down our faces and you know people you know go to these sports games and put on had dresses and all that and they don't know the meaning behind this and they don't know how that affects our people\nYou know in this country we we have a huge problem of Messina murder indigenous woman you know I'm I'm an ongoing or going missing 'em you know higher rates than any other group in this country and nobody even knows about it um and nobody's trying to stop it except their people um and so that's it's really hard you know every family that I Know that's native has the story of woman that's gone missing 'em\nI Know a family every family well\nAnd we we we did a show recently about a collective\nI ... I Believe it was in Canada right yet in Canada I forgot the area\nUm but they put like a neighborhood watch group together to walk around at night to let community members now that we're here we see you do need anything are you okay just basic services because of this ... this crisis and murdered indigent\nEspecially when they built pipelines you know tiny back to climate change when they build these pipelines they'll have to build ... like man camps where the construction workers live to build these pipelines and they usually got from other states and other communities and you know they usually build these type things right ... right next reservations these men cancer right in our reservations and you\nKnow these men camps are usually all men and these men get very bored working on pipelines for months and so they go into the reservation and they still very young girls and women um and they raped and killed him and that they're never found again um you know on our reservations you know we\n... our our police ... our police departments can arrest these people because we don't have ... jurors diction to do so and so these men can go and do whatever they want and we have no control over it\nAnd it's very sad 'cause at any moment\nI mean you winning a Brower used the word is so important because you're in the bay area doing lots of interviews to raise awareness about these issues right as difficult as it is to talk about it to hear these things about\nThe ... ... ... ... horrible information that's still being taught in schools today but it's just so important\nRight it's very important you know people need to realize that this is happening today and we can't allow this keep happening because it it will keep happening with people do something right\nAnd talk about it and why the may ... a year both important to raise awareness about this\nRose with all as a Seventeen year old from Minnesota who is fighting the line three pipeline which has proposed to go through Minnesota an indigenous territories", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
