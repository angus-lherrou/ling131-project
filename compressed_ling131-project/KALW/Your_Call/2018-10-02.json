pending before the Senate have ties to this group of conservative and libertarian law students lawyers and academics every city in Supreme Court justice has spoken before the federalist society White House chief counsel Don McGahn is a member as are many of his staff members\nBy most accounts the federalist society supports judicial nominees with an quote originalists perspective meaning they believe the constitution should be interpreted according to its meaning when it was written since the Nineteen seventies the conservative movement has been working to take the courts from liberals\nAnd they have been wildly successful\nFrom the federalist society to religious organizations\nJoining us to talk about how they pulled it off and what's next our two guests\nJoshua Wilson is associate professor and the political science department\nAt the University of Denver and author of several books including the new states of abortion politics\nHi Joshua welcome to the show and thanks revenue and great to have you Sarah opposing her as a reporter with the investigative fun of the nation Institute and author of God's profits faith fraud and the Republican crusade for values voters Hi Sarah welcome back to the show for having me again we're great to have you\nWell I Want to ask you both about a show we're going to do tomorrow but I Want to get your take on it so we are going to talk about the FBI investigation and a number of Brett Kavanaugh's former classmates are coming forward\nSaying that he was a heavy drinker and they would not be surprised if he couldn't remember a lot of the things that he did a three women who have accused him of\nA variety of things from drunken groping to facilitating gang rape all say that they want to talk to the FBI and then you have Mitch McConnell saying you know what to bad we're going to vote on friday a Sarah what do you what are your thoughts on this do you think that the votes going to happen on friday\nWell it will only happen if Mitch McConnell knows that he has the votes and so that would be if I'm either two or three of the three Republican senators that we're all talking about Murkowski flake and Collins\nUm agreed to vote for Kavanaugh a healing needs to and then you know vice president Pence could\nBreak the tie or so but I think that it would be an embarrassment for ah for McConnell to hold a vote if those three\nDo not vote for Kavanaugh and I think what we're all watching now is to what extent the FBI investigation\nWould be satisfactory to these three senators some of whom you know I'm thinking of play can particular is known for taking these supposedly bold stands against Trump but then eventually just resenting and voting the party line when push comes to shove\nBut I think that what's at issue here with the FBI investigation\nIs not whether the FBI fines is sufficient evidence to prosecute a Brett Kavanaugh for something whether it's perjury or sexual assault or any any cry and\nThe question is does the background check because remember this is the background check that everybody who's up for a federal judge ship or the kind of background check check that anybody who's\nBeen nominated for some kind of political appointment and the federal government is is subject to and this is to determine the person's suit ability to hold that kind of post so the question here is this person suitable to be\nUh in large part because conservatives didn't have any sort of organizing institution\nBoth uh within law schools and in the legal practice world\nAnd so part of explaining the success of\nOf the federal society um is basically the absence of any competitors right that there were there basically the only game in town if you're a conservative last ... conservative lawyer\nHum and that makes them incredibly powerful because it brings together the disparate parts of the conservative coalition um there's there's quite a few things are kind of I don't know exactly where you want to go with federal society uh right now but some some important things to bring up about it or to\nUh one is the federal society is a decentralized organization and a lot of ways so\nCollege or a law school campuses have their own kind of independent groups there's going to be independent a practice groups of the federal society and cities and so forth\nUm and so it's a really decentralized groups so it's hard to talk about kind of a monolithic federal society um\nWhere people are want to kind of talk about this monolithic idea is going to be through a leaders like Leonard Leo uh I was going to be through national conventions and so forth um and so and that and to get back to one of my earlier point of why they're so important in terms of applying resources\nA part of it if they they provide credentialing release so in the past when you were you asked earlier kind of who's making the calls on staffing the court um\nAnd the federal society provides a way for Republicans to who feel assured that judges that are that they're putting forward or nominees that they're putting forward are what they consider\nOr to put somebody who is a part of the Republican Party on to a court but then once they're on the court they're not going to decide a in kind of lockstep conservative fashion and so we can cite multiple dresses within the past ah who they say ah this this person didn't\nLive up to a kind of our expectations on what the federal society allows for is a way of the fed credentialing conservative lawyers and if you have the right\nA centrally package profile a resume\nAnd the B federal society certification than we know that we have a good pool of potential conservative justices and that's what presidents have been able to pull on a basically since the Nineteen eighties really into the starting really in the Nineteen nineties\nSo one of the judges that I think is a good example is Harriet Miers at the New York times the daily podcast had a great segment about the federalist society a couple of months ago\nAnd the person they were interviewing interviewed said that the federalist society was not happy when George W. Bush appointed Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court they didn't really know her\nAnd they expressed a lot of anger and basically said we are not going to back this person because we don't know this person and she stepped down do you think that's one of the better examples Joshua\nYou know I think contrasting Harriet Miers with capital is actually excellence are going to be able to write this point because you're exactly right the the uh George W. Bush picked Harriet Miers 'cause it's kind of personal connections to her\nAnd kind of have this statement to the to GOP leadership of essentially trust me I I Know her but she didn't have the credentialing really that we now expect conservative a judicial nominees to have on your side through the federal society and so forth and so the ... that was meant bolt\nNo contrast her with Kavanaugh right there's many more reasons why uh the GOP might have wanted to pull back on Kavanaugh but instead they are going to double down on that have doubled down on Kavanaugh\nOr because he has the collection of credentials that they want and so they're willing to spend political capital to take risks\nTo put him in place especially with kind of the looming midterms are ahead\nJoshua Wilson is associate professor in the political science department at the University of Denver and author of the book the new states of abortion politics\nSarah ... is a reporter with the investigative son of the nation Institute and author of God's profits faith fraud and the Republican crusade\nFor values voters since the Nineteen seventies the conservative movement has been working to take the courts from liberals they've been wildly successful today we're talking about how they did it and what's next\nIf you have a question or comment for our guests we'd love to hear from you\nIf you'd like to talk about the changes that you've seen on the court over the last\nFour so decades you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nSarah you have written extensively about Brett Kavanaugh why do you think that conservatives are really doubling down on him\n[noise] well uh I think part of it is timing that they feel like they have to confirm him because they might run out of time or should the Senate lose control of the uh\nTo to the Republicans lose control the Senate and the midterms um so I think that that's part of it and I think another part of it is that they were\nThey refused to cave in to what they perceive as a liberal\nTo use a Trump term witch hunt 'em I think that for decades the conservative movement\nHas Herbert a grievance about a judge a Robert Bork not being confirmed to the Supreme Court in Nineteen eighty seven and also that the\nJustice that they got instead of four was Anthony Kennedy who of course capping would replace if or succeed if he if he were to be confirmed and Kennedy\nEspecially for social conservatives has proved to be a great disappointment to them he did not overturn roe versus Wade and in fact he\nWas responsible for this string of decisions leading up to ... which legalized same sex marriage across the country\nSo I think that\nFor conservative activists backing down on Kavanaugh right now like just\nIsn't an option and that they would use anything from you know gas leading to worry about is um to diminish\nAh the the potency of any of the allegations against him whether it's the um sexual assault allegations or uh dishonesty just who is a um to the Senate Judiciary committee or just his demeanor and impartiality and partisanship issues\nAnd also Sarah since you've written extensively about the religious right can we talk about the different factions\nOf the conservatives because you know in many articles that basically says that they decided that they had to put their ideologies aside they needed to come together they needed to stop fighting and really be on the same page and I mean they've been wildly successful\nBut what about the different factions you've got to corporate ... like the the CEOs right the business interests you\nHave the conservatives to social conservatives libertarians the anti regulation which can over a lot of us can overlap right then you have the religious groups so what about all of those various factions can you talk about you know where they overlap and where they disagree\nWell I think in terms of the court's there's not a ton of disagreement with social conservatives tend to be very anti government regulation on when it comes to questions that uh relate to the environment or regulation of the\nFinancial sector um or regulation of business more broadly so for them making common cause with um\nAnti regulatory or libertarian minded business interests was not really a huge stretch at all so to the extent that they had to set aside any disagreements you know in in in coming together and and pressing for this um\nFor this vision of\nThe courts I mean I think for says for social conservative I don't think it was much of a stretch now were there some business interests or people involved\nIn business who were perhaps not comfortable or haven't been comfortable\nWith the religious rights opposition to algae beauty rights for example well yes I think that's undoubtedly true you know we've seen that come up in legislative fights over things like a you know anti trans bathroom bills where the business community opposed these sorts of bills\nBut um you know in the main I think in in terms of achieving the objective of affecting the courts in this a conservative mindset I they've pretty much you know been on the same same page\nAnd look at a response from Josh I'm All right after the brakes are opposing or as a reporter with the investigative find that the nation Institute\nSaid for values voters Joshua Wilson is associate professor and the political science department at the University of Denver and author of the new states of abortion politics on today's your call we're talking about how the conservative movement has been so successful in taking court\nThat's kind of the way it comes out\nJoshua\nI'm so a couple of things that one of them is um [noise] you can find so they're they're going to be certain cases lakes the Hobby Lobby case where all the different parts of the coalition are able to come in on that case because they all feed their own value in it\nUm but another thing to direct measures back when I was saying the federal society as a decentralized organization [noise]\nUm this is one of the values of being a de centralized organization is that you can have different chapters that have different interests right and so it's really just in coming together around cases\nThat you're looking to build coalitions and so as long as it's decentralized as long as there is no one set\nFederal society agenda writ large you can kind of let a thousand flowers bloom and then left a those individual kind of organizations produced the resources that might result in cases that are able to travel up up the traditional part time um the other is can I can I\nSay one thing about the the federal society and game throughout the questioner leaves yes\nOkay so um [noise] a couple of things the when you look at the different forums\nThey're being law school chapters and they're being practice chapters and so it's it's a really nicely organized a system to kind of address multiple layers that you need to address in order to get\nSuccessful use of the courts right so\nYou you focused on law schools in part to produce conservative lawyers right and you also want to ah help foster conservative academics who can put out intellectual resources that then conservative lawyers who used to be you know law students\nOr couldn't pick up some of those academic arguments and use them to make novel a cases novel ... basically novel legal legal claims in court cases\nAnd then as time goes on is what we've been talking about here\nAs a people from the federal society excel in their professions you can began installing them in the judiciary right and so what you're doing is you're getting a whole nice pipeline here of\nLawyer too you can think of a kind of his foot soldiers if you want to uh resources for them in terms of intellectual resources and networking resources to bring together\nA disparate lawyers who are interested in the same things so they can share the burdens of bringing cases and then eventually you want to have a judiciary that's going to be receptive to these arguments and then also by creating a whole\nOrganization that kind of an ... this is where he gets kind of the the more lead levels of the federal society\nA Amanda ... who has a a great book on the federal side he called ideas with consequences talks about the importance of a judicial audience\nAnd the idea there being that judges can be surrounded and their social circles by conservatives who basically will talk to them about their case decisions who will basically help police the judiciary as well and so that's kind of a if you want to think about it as an end game is to [noise]\nTo basically be producing and deploying conservative judicial resources throughout the entire pipeline of of legal ...\nWell just about to ask you about is there anything comparable on the liberal or progressive side I'm Joe Wright writes in and says the American Constitution Society endeavor to be the liberal equivalent of the federalist society it's a fantastic organization that church deserves everyone's support Joshua\nYes so for this or you can get back to also the of the American Constitution Society is the progressive response the federal society but\nOne thing to recognize is that the American Constitution Society entered is a much more crowded field and the federal society entered right there was no no kind of pre existing conservative a collection of of organizations for the federal society to compete against 'em and you could say\nYou know if you're a progressive law students or progressive lawyer you might go do work for the ACLU or you know there's there's ... you might go work for the um the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund right there's lots of different venues for you to go to\nSo the ... the American Constitution Society ... much more\nCrowded field um and so so their wallets created as a response to the federal society it starts off a at a deficit in relation to the federal society ...\nIs there and just ... what would you add\nYou know I thought what Josh with that it's right on point\nWell let's take a couple of callers and I'm Sorry we lost you Judy I'll ask your question Judy wanted to know why did an Obama lead so many vacancies for Trump to sell how did we get to a point where ... all of these judges\nJosh I'm at you want to take out one\nUm it's not so much that Obama left it open as\nSo this is the the really important point of elections matter when it comes to Sherry right you know the the Republicans right now have the the the perfect collection of they control the presidency or they control the Senate ... the president's the executive branch nominate judges for the federal bench\nAnd the Senate approves those uh judges\nAnd what Obama how to deal with for the majority of his presidency is yes Democrats controlled the presidency but that didn't control the Senate and so the Senate could basically\nSlowed to a trickle the rate of approving judges and this is part of the long term thinking of the GOP was we hold open these spots so that we can stop them later and Merrick Garland is the most obvious example of that because again the Supreme Court's would drew the attention and it was traumatic\nBut this was taking place throughout the entire federal judiciary for a very long time so now that the Republicans have the perfect kind of collection of resources there racing ahead to stop all the spots that they held open in ...\nYou know some people well I asked why didn't the Democrats scream about this or were they screaming and the national media just didn't really cover it\nWell I think this would go back to something we were talking about earlier in the hour and that is the\nDifference between the way the Republican base use the courts and the way the Democratic base use the courts because the\nConservative movement has been so successful at using the term judicial activists to describe judges\nWho may have a struck down um mandatory school prayer as violating the establishment clause\nOr um made abortion legal or made a same sex marriage legal they view that as judicial activism that threatens the entire American way of life so conservatives have been taught\nTo think about the courts in that way for a very very very long time and I think because liberals haven't been taught to see the courts as in such serious in need of a complete makeover that they're less likely to\nBe a so primarily motivated by it on in elections that doesn't excuse though Democrats not I'm casting death as the as the dire threat\nThat it was and I think that part of the issue also was that nobody thought that Trump would become president I'm so when you add in all those things together but you know so I think that the all those you add another things together and that sort of explains the ... democratic response to all of it but I think it also explains\nWhy so many Republicans who earlier in the primary process had cooked proclaimed themselves to be never Trump hers eventually um\nDecided to go along with him because they knew that once he had basically agreed to do their bidding on judicial nominations that he was the answer\nTo sack in the courts if the Republicans held on to the Senate\nSarah posing as a reporter with the investigative son of the nation Institute Joshua Wilson is associate professor in the political science department at the University of Denver\nToday we're talking about how the conservative movement has been so successful and stacking pointing their judges to the Supreme Court and also the U.S courts of appeals let's here from Lisa in San Francisco Hi Lisa welcome to the show\nUp at high guarding the ending a question I'm Alive Robert Reich was mentioned as he put out a video regarding this at the basically looks like right has been attempting to take over the state legislatures as well\nState legislators to be two thirds majority to be able to call for a constitutional convention which would literally change the rules change the constitution and one of the issues when the constitution is the fourteenth amendment which is what I'm trying to change which would give the automatic citizenship to people born in the United states um\nAnd the voting rights issue that has been the for the courts several times is basically a two prong strategy to\nTo limit the a democracy basically especially with regard to minorities and uh and immigrants who have children neither state um basically I what I think that they're basically trying to change the ethnic composition of the United states and there\nAre afraid of of of a minority voters specially which by the way will not be a minority burn through um so I I think that's a strategy that they're using and the courts served to support their um their strategies guide voting rights and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
