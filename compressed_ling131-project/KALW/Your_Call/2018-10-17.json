G.\nAnd joining us today to talk about the festival our two guests and palm quest directed the documentary from Baghdad to the bay and it's her first feature length documentary she's also a producer and director of photography for the documentary short series Oakland originals and air and joined us in Studio\n... thank you for coming in and congratulations on the film Hi rose thanks so much for having me it's a pleasure to be here thank you\nWere also joined by ... by telling on executive director of the Arab some festival and the Arabs film and media Institute\nThe festival began back in Nineteen Ninety six and it's the longest running and largest showcase of Arabs films and filmmakers in the U.S Sarah was born and raised in Beirut before moving to the United states and he also joins us in Studio ... thank you for coming in ... great to have both of you\nLet's talk a little bit just generally about the Arab film festival\nAnd on your website a number of the founders say that you found that the media Institute the film and media Institute to fight bigotry and hate with powerful art and storytelling that fosters empathy and understanding of our common humanity and to also support Arab talent in the United states can you talk about that\n[noise] sure I mean I think there's a such a lack of um Arab voices and their representation in American culture American mass media and so are you from where I was really launched me would have been running the film festival for about point Twenty years\nUm but we wanted to go beyond just sort of the exhibition of films\nDuring server to undo or two week period and also develop young and new um storytellers within our communities to serve share their stories and and to serve portray their lives and\nAnd be sort of a be able to chose the stereotypes to use ... Americans or Muslim Americans on on the screen\nAnd I mean obviously so much happened after nine eleven and now so much more is happening under the Trump Administration when it comes to\nJust blatant racism and then that ugly stereotypes that you hear from this administration and they get repeated in the media what would you say concerns you most right now\nI'm going to be Frank I'm you know I'm I'm not a fan of either of the political parties or do stuff which means you know such racism towards your community and the Muslim community has been or mhm um\n[noise] [noise] just\nJust the quality just the quality across the board I mean I'm just saying that we have three submissions to the twenty Nineteen Academy Awards that's ... that's that's a hybrid or just that\nUm but it's the ... it really is I Can't stress that enough because one thing to watch a film that has a great story line good characters um but if it if it's visually pleasing if there's issues would sound or music or but to see just complete films films that\nYou know Hollywood should be screening Netflix should be picking up um TV stations should be\nShowcasing and they're they're they're not\nI think that's that's sort of our next challenge to to to take on\n... I Know it's a difficult process that lie I may\nYou know there's the you know we can always refer to ... and his work around um Arab representation in Hollywood particularly but I Do the more that we work especially with a firm I we are working with the industry more and more you know we launched last year but we're already sort of developing partnerships with\nA net flicks and some independent and organizations like that and I've been astonished to see that it's less there is\nIt would be wrong for me to say that there isn't racism and industry and but that's not it's not it really also comes down to just awareness\nUm you know I still get approached by people who work in the industry who want me to support sort of like films from Iran or turkey or Israel and sort of\nA ... kind of I have to take a step back and be like okay so we were still in that phase of all let him know what the Arab world is who you know Lebanon or Jordan and just certain demands and content that's coming out some I'm hoping that\nSo we'll see more ... or content on on the string Aaron and I would I Would also add to that that until we have more diversity and the decision makers that these um organizations companies um that's not going to change I'm fortunately because those are perspectives that are going to make that a that would change possible\nCivil would it take to try to get Netflix to carry from Baghdad to the bay\nI Wish I had an answer to that question I don't know if there's another word for it and said I Do but um it's\nYou know the one thing that I've heard recently and it's been a very interesting and making a film over the course of ten years because\nFor many years especially being a new film maker I Would hear okay finish the phone first and then we'll be there for to support you if if it's something we can get on board with and then we finished the film now and I'm hearing sorry acquisitions are dead [laughter] we want to get first and [laughter] so\nSo the market kind of shift it's very fickle it's really hard to keep up with and\nAnd that currently I as far as I Know I'm Netflix is doing mostly carrot contest these days with some high levels elections that may be coming out of the top festivals maybe just Sundance was point but these are just the rumors I've been hearing I'm not\nTotally clear Aaron ... directed the documentary from Baghdad to debate as her first feature length documentary and you can find show times at Arabs Film Institute dot O. R. G. Serge ... is executive director of the Arab some festival in the Arab film and media Institute\nAnd it runs through October twenty first again the website is Arab Film Institute dot O. R. G. and if you have any questions or comments for our guests\nIf you have seen any of the films of the Arab film festival either ... this year past years what really stood out for you and what are your thoughts about where we are right now we will talk about media stereotypes\nThroughout the show but here's one stat ... his search just talked about analyzed one thousand films that have Arab and Muslim characters one thousand\nAnd found only twelve positive depictions fifty two neutral nine hundred and thirty six negative portrayals of Arabs\nNine hundred and thirty six negative for trails out of one thousand films\nSo what stands out for you when you see films with Arabs and them\nAnd if you're a filmmaker what are your thoughts on these issues the toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and if you are Arab what do you think about the way that you are presented on the screen\nAaron what are your thoughts about that I mean that's that's the stats are amazing\nAnd then another one between two thousand two and twenty Thirteen only one point eight percent of directors whose film screen at the Sundance Film festival where Middle Eastern Arab American filmmakers are so underrepresented to often not even worth their own category and industry diversity reports\n[noise] ah well I had an interesting conversation with somebody recently that inspired the way I'm going to answer this and I think that um well it may sound shocking to many people for people of color and certainly women as well and the industry it's not surprising how this has been going on you know since the beginning [laughter] so um\nI did see some of these similar to statistics recently put up I'm against women and saw him as well and it is fascinating and really the big take away and the drive for change that has been recommended by many people who are doing this research is that people\nUm that that the decision makers need to me more representative so that's kind of the take away that I have from that and the hope that I have is that um this is coming to light and people are talking about this more and more and that's the the catalyst for change\nAnd surge we have a question from Jerry ... who says\nWell both right directed by women and when I read the program it stated that forty percent of the films are directed by women this is an impressive percentage how difficult was it to put together a festival that has a higher percentage of film directed by women than we are accustomed to\n[noise] well thank you Jerry for attendance festival a nut and difficult at all um\nWe Jones and I say this over and over again you know we we definitely are proud of the forty percent or we want it to make sure it's higher but it's not something that we go into programming meeting a decision say let's make sure we have a you know at least half\nOf our films directed by what it just happens that women in the Arab world and outside of the Arab world ... working on their content are making brilliant films so it's not again it's not a [noise]\nYou know I always I'm proud of that number ... ... I Would say it's still a bit low um but it's not something that we go into and say this is what we want to do it just happens at the films or or just excellent films\nYou didn't need to go digging through binders as women [laughter] you know and and and\nOn the ground in the Arab world and this is something that you know with the way Arab and ... women are portrayed on camera\nIn shows and movies and you have this representations herb women are somehow submissive and uh you know the I have no voice of their own and yet when you not not just with the filmmakers but when you see the change makers on the ground\nIn the west bank and Gaza in across the Arab world oftentimes it's led by women in Tunisia you know when you were just speaking about the Arab Spring and its uh you're you're not seeing those women on\nI'm On the news for example ...\nAnd ... it was just wonderful that in the when it comes to the filmmaking space that women have really exert themselves in it and and rightfully so\n[noise] you know you just reminded me of all the gothic killings and I I've been wanting to do a show about this just because so much is happening\nAnd you know we're guilty and we'd barely even touched on it and because it happened we did have I think we can if media roundtable on it and then we just haven't revisited it and we really need to what what'd you say what kinds of sounds are coming out right now of the west bank and Gaza\nAre Palestinian futures are ... very political but we also have a film like reports on certain selenium that's a that's a love primarily love story with sort of the political tension as as a backdrop so I Love films like that as well that sort of a it's a story that\nAnyone in the world can sort of relate to or touch on and just happens there there is sort of a political context to it\nAnd what about the political film [noise]\nYou know we definitely have you know film like ... from under the rubble I'm sort of touching on certain laws the atrocities that happened and are happening this as a [noise] um\nWe have a nine eleven the uprising that believes showing again this weekend in Oakland so\nI'd have to ... I Know the festival has had to deal with protests and things in the past ... have have has anything like that happened this year\nThis year I mean we've definitely I'm not [noise] not may be too big but we've definitely had some conflicts with you know I've definitely show more um\n[noise] how'd you do content since I've come on which um with with some of our funders hasn't talking about a ... you know we've also shown films that sort of well I'll say this one of the wonderful things but when I say about experimentation and our ... filmmakers I'm\nOne of the things is ...\nIn in New ways it was with new ones with with approaching a using storytelling very creatively and it's it's not always you know folks worse or the very linear documentary about occupation\nA political uh um office to Iraq at the time\nAnd you also have a few of us retired army colonel in the film at that basically saying that guy's ones saved their lives and saved many American lives because of his translations skills and he was so dedicated to what he was dealing yeah I think you know I I Want a trail off\nJust a little bit on this because something about goes on as always had an impact on me is that he is this kind of very unique cultural liaison so in every community that he exists and he's always an outsider on some level and yet at the same time\nBecause of his kind of gregarious outgoing personality he's not only able to kind of find a sense of belonging and each of these communities but also kind of um breakdown any kind of walls that people may have or or or just to kind of um\nDisarm them in a way that allows them to see perspective as you know change their perspective is about community is that they may not interface with normally\nIn the film ... says I gave my soul to them speaking about the U.S military ... can you talk about I mean I guess because one could answer this better and maybe we can have him on in the future if you're listening\nYou're listening later after work did the climate of suspicion that let the military to suspect him as being a spy after they credited him with saving so many lives what was that about\nWell you know instead of an answering for goes on and I was not there at the time and we've done the best we can and to do research we've we did submit freedom of information um acts\nAnd through a a a few lawyers that we're working with us we got some documents back so we feel confident in the story that we're telling also and the people that are presented in the film and their versions of the story\nBut I don't think we're ever going to know exactly why\nIt goes one was arrested we could not get those documents and what I think when my my opinion would be that he really was caught up in the pinot paranoia of the time I I Would imagine I suspect that racism was a part of it\nUm but the one thing that I think it's important to acknowledge is that he was not alone in us and I read an article a couple of weeks back about a father who still looking for his son who has a very similar story took us one who\nMay have been cited recently and could potentially still be alive and in detention so I don't think this is a one story I think this has happened to many people and how was it not for the um height at which I'm a colonel Nicholson sat\nI'm not sure that goes one would have been released so I think that the system is incredibly disorganized at the same time as being highly organized in a really dysfunctional way um and and you know calls to what's happening with the children these days as well\nAnd and the documentary from back that to the bad guys one el Sharif says that the military police took him they put him in handcuffs and a three foot square cell he was not allowed to talk in front of other Iraqi detainees he said the U.S accused him of being a spy a double agent a traitor and a terrorist and and the film\nHere is ... al Sharif describing what happened next [noise]\nThey put me in\nThe room or\nSee around me feeling [noise]\n\nAnd I'm not a lot\nJust signing\n... I Know it's a long time until your body like new muscles\nEverything you can feel the more\nI was blindfolded and there were and they don't have all kinds of things coming on me\nThey asked me was that was\nDone\n\nThey move me from the jail to another place where there were this time for people and they are not military there are civilians [noise] ... happen over there they haven't\nSo far all over again this time it was the bags on top of your head\nThey drew water on top of me so I feel I'm drawing\nYou're hiding something I Know you hiding something you know you need to tell them even to telling me every day every day every day and I was like why don't you guys believe me this is my story I have nothing to tell you you know my body was hired a wall was tortured and then one day he pushed me to a level I\nI'm gay [noise]\nThat was my first time ever I didn't have that chance previously ...\nTo keep it inside of in gun slung\nChange to Hawaii\nThat is a clip from Baghdad to the bad guys on al Sharif who worked as a translator for the U.S military and then he was falsely accused of being a spy he was arrested tortured in prison for Seventy five days\nI mean that is that was so amazing Erin Erin punk quest is director of the film is the first time he ever said he's gay is when he's\nBeing tortured in jail by the United states [noise]\nYeah you know and when he actually this was one of the last interviews that we did with him where this came out a\nAnd I think in having this memory we talked a lot about who goes on is today and in many ways um it sounds strange to say but he's thankful for this experience that he had because\nHe would describe himself before if anybody knows cars on they'll think this is very unusual but if he would describe himself before\nComing here before what happened to Iraq as being very Meek and timid and doing whatever his family would want for him to do and if you met him today you would see a very very different person and so this open the door for God's one too\nI guess you know honor the strength that he had to be able to survive that and in doing so really believe that he could do anything\n[noise] surge what really struck you about this film from Baghdad to the bay I mean there's so many layers to it\n[noise] I'm into personal story you know in the context of not just the war the occupation in Iraq\nHis sexuality um it's his story it's a very personal story than again not the deliver the point you're not seeing stories like this or anywhere else and if it's not for air and it's not for or filmmakers from your you won't see so\nI I'd like to also add that the really interesting thing about because he is not um\nTypical person he's quite unusual person in wondrous ways and\nThe incredible thing about that and his story is that as I was mentioning before he was often an outsider in these communities that he exits and so this film and his life intersects with\nUm communities that don't generally come together or might not typically come together um so it's really this amazing meeting ground for conversation to be had\nAcross the algae beauty community the Arab community immigrant community even the military community and then for people who who are\nIn other communities coming to the conversation they may be challenged by any number of 'em and misunderstandings or a stigmatization stigmas that they might cast on any any of these different communities so it's really kind of a an\nAn incredible convergence of um topics especially with everything that's happening today\nIt it kind of I mean it brought up so many emotions including some anger because\nThis is one story of of so many and you think about all the lives that have been lost not only in Iraq Afghanistan Syria young men right now\nAnd you know here we get I mean there's good journalism that's happening but in passing you hear about the bombing and then it's the the move on and then two days later there's another bombing but all of these lives obviously have a story I mean it sounds so silly to even have to say that\nBut we just had the surgery\nHaving shot there's a face to it yeah I think that's where so incredibly incredibly powerful because you see the ...\nUm you see him ... there was a visual there you know when we think of as many of the atrocities of happened in Gaza for decades and it was until you know unfortunately as heartbreaking as was to seeing a child on the beach the provoke anger so um [noise]\nTo be able to see the hugging the visual is again the hope is bill ... or something and and people to start challenging I'm not just the journals but the politicians the the actions we take the way we vote everything right into\nThe difficult thing is for us in the present time is that we want to see change immediately\nAnd I think the thing I always try to remind myself of and making this film and everything else is that especially right now we are running a marathon we can't run a sprint or going to burn out and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "17"}
