playing guitar now your is this is electric\nWell it's an acoustic guitar that you can plug in and it's my own design and when I designed it I part of the idea was they had to plant a tree for every guitar mine they may so someday that little boy that inspired the acoustic guitar those nine months he was in the womb\nMaybe he'll walk through the forest and take his little boy and say the reason some of these trees or here's 'cause your grandfather played some music a long time ago oh [noise]\n\nWhat are you going to play here for well the first time I'd like to play in case you're wondering it's almost all on one string guitar and if you're wondering why is that guy only plan on one string it was the way the song was originally written by a twelve year old boy who can only reach one string\nIn the hospital because he was hit by a drunk driver him and his dad and the family car and he woke up with two broken arms are broken wrist or broken found a broken leg broken foot and a broken ankle and the way it's cast where he can only reach so far out of cash which makes you can only reach the eastern\nSo we wrote this beautiful song on the east during and after is correct issues in this crutches in his wheelchair\nThe music helped him kill and I think as Dr knew that it was good for a soul as well as the circulation so I Know the story about this little boy because I was little boy and this song is on a Grammy nominated album Thirty years later and it's titled since it's all on the east during my doctor's name was Elizabeth I called and he lives with his son\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] oh it's beautiful [noise]\nExplored well one string I did use or fewer women one finger\nSo bad it sounded like one finger finagle story of when I was hit we were in the family car in a a a drunk driver cross the line and hit his head on but my dad told me the story about Les Paul who was in a bad car accident and dad's set up I stayed with my physical therapy and got through it he'd buy me electric guitar so he kept his promise and\nThen I started playing on electric guitar in the bedroom with my door locked and that thought that was just a phase I was going through and\n... of it when I'm going to teach so signature moves throwing the guitar picking the audience later he was go to bars that studio fifty five\nWith a band and

your\nBand a gym right so just down the street was working with Santana not too long ago here they record their albums right down the road you're at ground zero right now for the bay area music scene gyms my bass player he's been with me for Twenty years Jim Wright's along base right from\nWeight off in my drummer is with me for over Twenty years now actually we've discoveries Roswell New Mexico
