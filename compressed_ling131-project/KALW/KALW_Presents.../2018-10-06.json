by the composer John Cage pay Larson is written a remarkable book where the heart beats John Cage then Buddhism in the inner life of artists and how John pages relationship to Buddhism shapes not only his music\nThe fifties sixties and seventies\nRubbery shaped the musical world it was a digital music pioneer who founded listen dot com that became wraps it either folded into real networks\nAnd was part of the music streaming business he's written a novel called years zero an entertaining look at the intersection of the music industry Washington DC the vagaries and the complications of\nCopyright law that in tangles the rest of the galaxy and the aliens are furious and the Internet culture\nYou remember the Internet it used to exist in this country for more information about the broadcast WTO that or gee\nThe book is called where the heart beats it's John Cage is then Buddhism and the inner life of artists by Kay Larson\nAnd she was writing this book over Fifteen Years I had the opportunity wants to go to this extraordinary sound conference out of the Skywalker Ranch with various sound designers been birds and so this was\nI don't know Twenty years ago and John Cage was there\nAnd I remember I asked him a question about Beethoven and other sounds and\nHe gave the most profound an enigmatic answer which all I remember as the feeling of it as a and I don't remember the specifics of the question of answer he'd clearly fought\nA lot about something far more than I had and in this book where the heartbeat K Larson examines exactly how John Cage came to think the way he did\nAnd the great pieces such as four minutes thirty three seconds or the piano sits at the keyboard I thought about doing that today and the second half\nWe might have time for it he also did a piece called zero zero where no time at all I don't know maybe that would be more appropriate [laughter]\nTaylor some has been a journalist she's been a an art critic for many years for the village voice and for New York magazine in Nineteen Ninety four she got her ... practice at a Buddhist monastery in upstate New York please welcome K Larson to west coast [noise]\nWhat drew you to John cages of subject oh I fell in love with him uh\nI I also had a meeting with John Cage that was very enigmatic and and deep\nThis happened when I was um I was an art critic for forty years I suppose I still am\nAnd in the middle of my rounds one day a through the galleries this is a friday afternoon in New York and I was going to a Russian bird extradition um and I walked in the gallery there was nobody else in the gallery except John Cage\nAnd he walked over to me I later found out he did this because he always wanted to kind of ties up whoever was around and see what they were on his side and he he walked up to me and he said something I don't remember what he said and I says something flip because that's who I was back then and uh\nAnd he looked at me in a way that I'll never forget because it was a a a look that size up look through me said who are you\nAnd not in a judgmental way just a very out of pure curiosity and I only later saw someone look that need that way when I met my son's teacher so\nWhat changed and how would you describe John cages a composer as an artist\nAmazon but as it came to the United states in the Nineteen fifties who was the what was he trying to do it as an artist\nWell there's an ark and John Cage is music that parallels the arc of his spiritual path\nSo I I did not set out to write a biography of cages music although there's a lot of music on this book I set out to write the biography of that spiritual ark\nAnd uh it begins in a certain sense and then it begins at the beginning of cages life but but there's a certain point at which\nCage falls apart he enters a dark night of the soul uh he he is completely confused who's just the gun falling in love with the man who would become his life partner Merce Cunningham and Federer idea of reasons are complex reasons including the fact that he was going to have to divorce has watched ...\nCage fell apart and there was a piece of music that reflects is falling apart is called four walls I saw it in performance in New York in Nineteen Ninety nine and it's a piece of ... which cage bangs his head against the wall of his own suffering over and over again then there's a long period where he sets out to solve this problem\nAnd he interestingly enough it turns to the the Asian or religions not first he turns to Christian mysticism and hindering mysticism and eventually the Hindu it as the tensions\nHe doesn't go to psychoanalysis he thinks about it he says nope he goes in a different direction and his new music through that period reflects this change because he gets he created ... so not as an editor lose which is one of his most beautiful pieces\nAnd it's about Hindu aesthetics in in ... and it he's looking for serenity simplicity silence quieting of his hurting mine then in Nineteen fifty duties as if it comes to New York and settles down and\nHe begins lecturing on send Buddhism and\nUp until then cages past had been about ideas he was looking for the idea of silence and the idea of serenity\nSays if you sit down and says if he gets in the Buddhist teachings which are about ... these qualities in your own life and cage gets it his music changes all the famous physicist that cage created that changed music and changed\nI argue the visual arts they all began after duties as if you came to town\nWhen you say it also changed the visual arts the suggests really profound shift in what the artist world certainly if Newark was doing at the time I mean how does affect the visual arts well\nUh this is partly an answer your question of how I got involved in this book because as I said I'm an art critic um I was teaching a course on the origins of art in the Nineteen sixties at a certain point and I kept finding John cages name associated with these artists I couldn't figure this out because it's not standard art history um and\nAs we've been dealing with just the person who does the visual art that there'd be a somebody working music adjunct with it\nRight he's a composer and so why is he in imposing all these digital artist and they began in Nineteen fifty one with Robert Russian bird who had at the time but virtually done nothing important then Nineteen fifty four which just for Johns who hadn't done any work at all\nUm and um then Ellen ... oh no Robert Morris you know all the pantheon has you know people we think of is changing the art\nOf the early Nineteen sixties they all have this relationship one way or another with John Cage so I said what's going on here and I looked at what cages learning from\nSuzuki and I said oh there's stuff which cage here's what specifically is teaching Suzuki teaching changes cages worldview\nAs John said to me at one point he was teaching and preaching\nAll through this period a all these artists heard him they heard what he was saying so there there's this new vocabulary that enters the art scene art is not an object that hangs on a wall or stands on the floor it's and vine metal and ... action throughout space and time\nIt's it's a formative thing it's is involved with process it and change its a condition where art in life are are the same thing not separate and on and on and those are the qualities that defined the art that was created after Nineteen sixty and we now think of as post modern and\nAs I said John Cage was doing this in Nineteen fifty to Nineteen sixty two\nWhich is a musician David tutor for them\nDavid Souter was a a David Souter appeared in this amazing way\nAt the very moment when cage and a kitchen is friend Morton Feldman really needed David tutor he showed up someone introduce them and tutor was brilliant musician I have a David Souter store this really comes from John Cage and it's really great\nSomeone sent David Souter and John Cage\nTo packages of Indians spices and and the post office shuffled boxes both got a little broken up so all the spices were mixed up with each other David tutor sat down and went through every single piece of spice put it in the right place and got through reconstructing the entire box and then said the John Cage\nYou want me to do that for you [laughter]\n[noise] tutor was the\nPerfect person to play he was a pianist it was a perfect person to play this very demanding music that cage and his cohort was developing it in the early Nineteen fifties\nWould John Cage of answered no I think it's fine that it got mixed up in the in the shipping\nYou know I don't know what he answered a he could have easily said that because the whole point of it in a way to accept what comes and not get attached to your own judgments about it\nI'm Talking with Kay Larson whose book is called where the heartbeat John Cage then Buddhism and the inner life of artists blaming the role of duties Suzuki and who's Buddhism and his teachings influence John Cage wouldn't turn influenced of the most major American artist so the fifties sixties and then subsequent but\nAnd then nothing is the source it's the it's the it's the origin and it's the ground that says if you called it the God had so the world and\nIts source art there's no distinction between them they are continually rising at all moments in returning to the to the void and then a rising again\nHe has a a piece called zero or ... Golan zero zero and says you're just briefly is nothing but the continuation of one's daily work whatever\nIt is providing it's not selfish but it is the fulfillment of an obligation to other people don't with contact microphones without any notion of concert or theater or the public but simply continuing ones daily work now coming up through violence speakers\nWhat's a peace tries to say is that everything we do is music or can become music through the use of microphones so that everything I'm doing apart from what I'm saying produces sounds\nYes he was a sitting on a I'm a staircase landing typing letters to people who had written to him drinking a glass of water and um the chair with squeaking and all of this was might\nSo that this is what you heard when you came into this John Cage performance and it seemed like a joke I've heard actually other biographers call it a joke but\nIt's not a joke if it's another profound moment in cages Buddhist path where he realizes that everything we do is fine everything we do is okay and ordinary life is OK and there's no distinction between that and art\nAnd also he realized that in writing letters to people who wanted something from him he was he says that that this piece is about fulfilling an obligation to others there's a point of the spiritual path where first you're doing it for yourself because you're hurting like crazy\nThen you're doing it for yourself because you start to feel better and things start to clear out and finally realized that yourself is not the issue with other people who are the issue is the rest of the world is the issue and so you fulfilling obligation to others because that's the mandate and that's the\nWord ... cage was at this point with his piece is zero zero zero which he called for thirty three number two\nThe biography doesn't cover is complete life but it covers the spiritual growth and and probably the most significant part and I I think that you've also changed art criticism by this book by reassessing how it is visual artists shape their life and their work because of what you did\nTwo things here first of all of the biography and around Nineteen sixty two because of that was the end of the arc of cages revelation so he continue to use these things for the rest of his life and since this is a spiritual biography not musical biography I felt this was a good place to end\nSecond there's a proposition here in this book that it was not Marcel Just shot her created postmodern art it was John Cage speaking from his own point of view about the shot\nWho actually created\nWhat we now think of as the article last fifty years and this is a proposition that I've not heard anybody propose before so in terms of\nYou know may dealing with judgments I'm kind of waiting to see what will happen after having said that\nWhy do you have covered photograph with his back to us working at the garden\nStrict well the first place it's the the ... the only photograph I found that the eleventh hour that appeal to me at all most of the rest of them have been published but this one hasn't\nUh but also its cage not looking at us he's looking he's turning around and looking into his in garden because he's looking into the deep\nInto the deep teachings I mean these are huge leap or phone teaching they are there's a whole a strain of in a whole discipline is and that just ask one question who am I\nWho am I who am I who am I and it goes very deep into the answer that's not the end that I practiced myself but ah\nBut it's still it's present and so cages looking into this and garden and saying what is this life what is this world\nWho who am I in relation to it because we were organisms noteworthy observers of miracle all you have to do is go straight on leaving the parents at any moment and to the writers were to the left coming back or never coming in of course out of the rain\nTo live with a book title arson and we'll just go\nWhere the heartbeat John Cage then Buddhism provide\nI find myself thinking about cable arsons book a lot\nAnd the notions ideas within\nThose in the west coast Florida My name's ...\nHow many have you on the radio audience as well as here at home raise your hand if you're at home and listening to a\nBetter taped and you find is changed your life I mean anyone of you've found that it was useless and give you headaches [laughter]\nMy next guest has written several books and she was a leader in the field of meditation her new book is called real happiness the power of meditation she's the author of loving ... was welcome Sharon prosper cost us why [noise]\nYou weren't always happy I understand that's true [laughter] that's very true how did you discover where are your feelings were up by looking within I thought you were going to ask me if I was always happy now so no I didn't excellent [laughter]\nThat was harder as a young girl your parents were unavailable to you when when ... when you were nine the other had mental illness by the time you were eleven you're on your own in the world and trying to cope without much of a guide to looking inward was the best place you could go\nWell I went to India actually went through school I was going to State University of New York at buffalo and they had an independent study program where few created a project you could go anywhere in the world theoretically for a year\nAnd then come back and do another year kind of cross cultural studying and you were Eighteen or Nineteen I was Eighteen yeah uh and I went I as a junior in college I went to India and trench drawn totally change when it made my life ... yeah\nWhen you get into India did you know that you were going to go look at meditation was a reason you went to and do you did you know why you were going\nI was going to learn how to meditate I've taken a course in Asian philosophy when I was a sophomore and honestly I think it was kind of happenstance I thought I Need a Tuesday chorus let me do that now\nI did something like that and it turned out to be a course in Buddhism and there were a couple of things actually in the course that were tremendous for me when was\nThe mood is very unafraid and ashamed acknowledgement of suffering in life because there had been with all of that loss in conflict in difficulty and no one ever talked about it just like it is for many people and so he was someone saying right out loud when I knew to be true and then\nHe said apparently that there were methods that one could use that anybody could you know one left out if they chose to that could transform the way you related to everything that happened including the suffering so I thought I'm going to go to India and check this out\nWas that immediate or did you have to be you know what was your course of familiarity\nIf it wasn't interested in talk more belief system or a new identity or rejecting anything else I Want to know what those methods might be and had to actually use them and that took a while to find\nDid you approach it as a method to or did eventually come into it as as ideas and philosophy\nMostly it's method I I have a great love for the ideas and philosophy and the ethics and and the way of life but really just into the method\nWhen you teach somebody how to be crime is it something that's ingrained in us to be kind and loving and its beaten out of a somehow\nSometimes sadly this beaten address literally but I Would say mostly I see this covered over obscured sometimes hard to reach sometimes hard to trust but I Do believe it's there\nAnd so what qualities do you think you have as a teacher to inspire others I mean you've sort of a major school and in New England in Massachusetts to do just tell me about the partners would you have in the ... in the teaching Institute\nA logistical jak cornfield and I began to retreat center in Massachusetts and Jack of course moved here and began spirit rock some years later\nWhen you would have a business meeting as an imagine you would you like meditate or would you sort of\nAttuned yourself [laughter]\nCertainly thinking that when I was thinking of secret dancing [laughter] we we kinda have our own means of secret dancing but it's very secret and that's actually one of the things I always treasured about the meditation practice\nThat it's a private you could be maybe a contentious meeting at work and you don't have to say excuse me men end up in the closet and political us equipment and set up and look obvious you know you just tuned into your breath and you're there\nThere are stories of a firefighter who's up all night doing a lot of work in New York and ... cab and and just take a break and meditate and find a place of peace and be restored mhm\nUh actually because the um part of the book is uh twenty eight day program we have a number of people including two firefighters and two police officers and some finance people doing the program blogging about it on my website ... and one firefighter did just that he said that he'd worked a lot of overtime as many people aren't\nHe had to sit by the burning man haul for three hours and he thought I haven't done my twenty minutes yet let me do it now what's a burning\nManhole [laughter] that I can say [laughter] we have some in New York and there is [noise]\nFriends on the neighborhood I don't know I suppose but is happiness or a natural human state or is it just sort of a temporary thing that we can achieve for\nWell I guess of course it depends on what you mean I'm pleasure is something we achieve and a temporary way and I actually think we should be very grateful that we have the amount of pleasure and the light that we get I think it's a tremendous thing but um even though like the book is called real happiness I think a more accurate title about perhaps not as poetic\n\n\nO. U. Mike good\nGood good when you get your music royalty checks how much comes in from outer space you wear that [laughter]\nIt's not that I Know none of the general well you're about to find out I get a dollar sixty from Canada once every six months well that's close enough to the inter galactic world here [noise]\nMy next guest is Rob breed is the founder of listen dot com which created the rap city service and ended up going on to go to the real networks he's the author of you won a memoir about student life at the Harvard Business school and architects of the Web but business history of the Internet he's written inter galactic novel about\nSpace aliens who come and have to find a lawyer to do with their music rights issues please welcome Rob read author years zero\nHaving been in the Internet music business in dealing with a jumble of confusing writes I suppose the idea of trying to explain the right structure to group of aliens comes naturally to\nYeah I was the alien for about five years in their um our copyright laws earning arcane set\nOf laws in international treaties that literally date back centuries\nAnd going through copyright law is not unlike doing archeology and the Mediterranean um laws they're sort of like these layers of laws that go back to certain eras there's the player piano laws which are still in effect laws that were made a great deal of sense in the year of the player piano then you have\nThe laws that were created when America needed to deal with the fact that we suddenly have broadcast radio when they go up layer after layer after layer until you get to\nA set of laws in the nineties that we're basically designed to strangle digital audio taping it's crap and they succeeded\nAnd then it kind of stops and we've got this mess that is in some ways very outdated in some ways was very visionary at the time but no longer is et cetera and um the aliens get very puzzled by all of this too great comedic\nEffect which is wonderful the aliens ... what is it it's a welcome back Kotter theme that they first here somehow and they learned that there's intelligent life from planet because of this yes well actually they intercept it how does that seem go are\nWelcome back\nAt the John Sebastian song John Sebastian of eleven spin falls into what happens is the uh the aliens dedicate it's a huge universe spanning population civilization they've all conquered all of the difficult problems of science and technology\nSo they ... dedicate their entire existence is to the creation and consumption of great parks and\nGreed will either music is appalling lead that and the reason for that is actually conversely ours is extraordinarily good for evolutionary accident\nReasons that I go into in the second paragraph of the book and then never go back to again it's kind of a suspenders disbelief point but so we make the world's most fabulous music were were quite battered most other things like stained glass and ... synchronized swimming and the other arts that the aliens revere\nBut we're really good at music and so they're always on the on the lookout for new primitive civilizations that have some kind of artistic potential\nAnd I'm so one day they pick up a first round episode of welcome back Kotter it's October thirteenth Nineteen Seventy seven was anybody remembers it's the one in which Arnold ... joins as any you've called but um so they pick it up and about midway through\nAnd it turns out like I said were terrible and everything else and they're looking at it as like how do these primitive have even broadcast television I mean look at the fashion sense the visual jokes the editing choices\nAnd then it happened and to the episode the music starts it's considered instantly to be the greatest creative achievement since the dawn of time itself [noise]\nSo they start collecting and playing it absorbing this music comes to them through outer space and then suddenly they materialize in the office of a lawyer who they've confused or at least one person who was confused with a member of the back street boys\nYes so what happens is the ... reasons that are big deeply into the storyline that the aliens are obliged to honor our laws and customs as they pertain to our own our own art\nAnd this means you're on the hook to obey are copyright laws which they misunderstand for about thirty five or forty years\nAnd then they come to the horrifying realization at the very beginning of the book that all of this music that they've been enjoying by our rules has been pirated and buy American law the maximum fine for pirating single copy of a single song is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd the total bill for the advanced civilizations has thoroughly bankrupted the entire universe or is it all the wealth in the universe is owed us particularly to use er and um\nYeah and so um this self appointed alien delegation decides we've got to go to earth and straighten this out and and they get here and they quickly realize that they need to reverse this complex ticket of laws and so forth and\nThey figure that to do that they need to get an ally a human ally\nAnd they need somebody very special first of all ideally somebody with an enormous artistic credibility because they figure that we review our musicians as much as they do so ideally one of the greatest musicians who ever lived they don't have re taste in music and then secondly somebody with incredible political might ...\nWho's the sheer force of will can just reverse all\nThese arcane laws and they think in Plano and that's pretty and I don't think we can do better than that and they continue their research\nAnd they realize that the most powerful media law firm on earth is called Carter ... marks the young man they're named that Carter and yes that is the name of a back street boys and they're like bingo we got a back street boys\nAnd they go and it's not a back street boy it said like I actually kinda hates the back street boys but it's too late the aliens have allied themselves with Nick Carter very low ranking and not particularly good copyright lawyer\nAnd he has forty eight hours to help them untangle this mess or something very bad\nMight happen so they're your that's your zero\nIs one of your hopes that Lawrence Lessig will read this book and it will help lose battles with the Supreme Court and evolving copyright law does something a little more\nNo I'm is written a lot of very very intelligent and cutting edge um ah actually three books on the subject of copyright law and how it should be for reform to the benefit of of you know lovers of of copyrighted material music lovers musicians um the country and so forth\nI thought when I was writing the book that he was the only person on earth who might read it [noise]\nUm because it was such a strain and I was like and I don't know a plastic like science fiction so I might be the only reader myself um I happen to know him just through Internet circles and so forth and um I called him a number of time we met one somebody's flotsam email and we spent some time on the phone\nJust because I wanted to make sure that my representation of copyright laws that existed in the book was as accurate as I could make it\nA so he has not only read the book\nBut he's tweeted it well\n[noise]\nWhen you started listening dot com was your vision and music ideal or was it an ideal to get something that somebody else would buy\nWhat will I was I'm a rabid lifelong fan of music and a a very poor musician and songwriter but I spent a lot of time you know playing guitar and recording things on a four track I at that point when I started the comedy probably at about a thousand vinyl records and a thousand CDs\nAnd I've been very fervent about music the other thing I was ... at that point in my life and this was Nineteen Ninety nine was the Internet\nThrough a couple of accidents I started working on the Internet really early in its commercial history right around Nineteen Ninety four Ninety five\nAnd I became very emotionally I Would even say it'll sounds silly but spiritually excited about what the Internet was going to enable and what it meant for all kinds of things and so I sat down and I wrote my second book I I took eight months off and wrote a book about the rise of the Internet as a commercial medium\nAnd uh then I because I was so deep and all this I managed to to talk my way into\nA job as a venture capitalist investing in early stage Internet companies and there are at that point I was pretty good at judging when things were ready for you know the next big wave and I judged in late Nineteen Ninety eight on music is music time is coming\nBecause the the net is getting fast enough\nHard drives or getting big enough and in late Ninety eight I saw my first portable MP three player and it's like\nThat's going to take the music off the Internet it into our lives and so it was really somebody who was fervently passionate about technology and specifically the Internet and somebody who had a lifetime adoration of music and it was like this is what I have to do\nAnd it's evolved so much could you've mentioned did you imagine them for instance you know people can listen over the Internet to radio shows anywhere in the world and sort of local music radio broadcasting the toll shifted profoundly\nAnd I I saw um I the second chapter of of the books I read about the Internet many years ago was about specifically ironically about the company that ended up buying mine I wrote up a bit of a biography\nOf a company called progressive networks which is now called real networks and they really pioneered streaming media and radio at the time there wasn't any video yet", "city": "San Francisco"}
