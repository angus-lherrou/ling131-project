I'm told is that I don't really ... I can\nVerify it myself [noise]\nWalter garr wig [noise]\nFive would you know while I should maybe explain that\nWhile I attempt to speak I'm\nTrying to tune is damn thing [noise]\nAnyhow he wrote a book about how to\nAnd he said that if you get the right hand right the left hand will follow about eighty percent of the book is on\nThe right hand I Can't really subscribe to that\nAs a demonstrated in the beginning of this too and it's kind of important to know what your left hand is doing as well [noise]\nAnd ah I should say that that arrangement and it's a\nIt's a it is an arrangement of ...\nIs an arrangement actually a failed attempt at playing which is you know really what I should call a Pete Seeger's arrangement of that piece for banjo I was trying to play the banjo to time and eventually I just couldn't you know abandoned the project\nBut you had to do it on the air uh twelve string guitar [noise] yeah uh\nWas done on the ... yeah if I were to do it today I had a\nIncluded the modulation and try and play it properly but I'm I'm not knocking it quite amazing to me that anybody ever gets to do what we're doing right now and it would be ridiculous to get picky about what you did when you did it and what you're doing when you're doing it\nVery true I'll ask you about something that you you did one time that you've you've written about which was a mysterious episode when you were a teenager aboard a submarine and you are on deck on watch and\nIt sounded like you encountered the great white whale or a great squid somewhere at to see it was\nBigger than our boat and um we hit it we rose up on it and I was on what shows up in the sale on the port side and it was all I can tell you as it was a ... other than that is that it was a thing of some kind [noise]\nBut you\nDo such a good job of it well I I'm I'm trying to\nLeave it goes against by nature as I've already\nYou have a new CD called clone that's a that's kind of a a goal full title\nWell there was a clown that's Mike gardens clone he found his clone floating around or the north east somewhere and the clown would appear with him on stage a\nBut not before the clown appear at first as Mike and Mike would walk out a little later this thereby disturbing some people\nIn the audience but others have just seen oh pardon my vision tonight I think so I\nThink so and eventually the clone a Mike began to get a lot of questions about the law and the clone began to get a lot of questions in his girlfriend started talking to the clown that was the end of the cloth [laughter]\nSo we brought her back for the for the record it was a lot of fun to make that record and were were threatening to make another one at some point\nYou have another restaurant here for well I now that I'm In tune on the twelfth string I thought I play something on the six string [laughter]\nAll right yeah it's a problem I have I'm going to pull my jak factor here it goes\nIn a\nSix string now do you need to do in this or is it all set to go or we're just gonna take it as it is I it seemed to be a\nNearby Leo cocky here on the west coast [noise]\n\nMm Mm\n\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThank you very much for stopping by what's coastline thank you it's good to be\n\nThe only thing the west coast guard [noise]\nYou already for Halloween costumes you tell Halloween ... stories do you hang up stockings I mean what are your traditions that you have\nWhat about the luck to you that tried to save Christmas or [noise] but a lot to the Santa ate\nWhat was the exact name of the book the lap cat who couldn't stop screaming there you go which is of course our holiday classic my next guest and west coast was written illustrated another one album which marks as major holiday will you please welcome the author of vampire boys good night and Lisa Brown\nOr what [noise]\nYou were wearing an absolutely elegant which has had red and white stripes stockings and the point is black pointed shoes with silver buckle where do you shop\n[laughter] in the hate the hate\nThe oh this is sort of normal day to day street where I forgot yeah quite All right so this is a book that you've written illustrated you tell the story of a vampire boy whose secret and the secret or I don't want to give a plug quite away here I don't know how to do this\nAnd it's a little vampire he's brought breakfast by his butler like most children on and he has a friend who's a little which my eye and portraying the little bitch and that they go out to look for real children because they've been told that real children do not exist and they're not quite sure\nAnd so this was a story to encounter the world and the same way that human children are told that vampires don't really exist\nIt's about being an outsider and then finding yourself inside for one night only and being accepted sort of accept that there's a costume contest in the book and uh the actual monsters do not when they're not authentic looking in [noise]\n\nWhat does that say about our culture that we cannot see authenticity within the original\nUm yes it's very true it's it's for all those little a ghoulish children who feel like they're on the outside looking in\nIllustrations are filled with little visual trees and the way the kids like to look at details I don't know if it's a tribute to to the film Kerry or not but you've got it\nBox we kind of a hand you also have a number of books that are lying around music or ... of the devils true score things would engage a parent as well as a child\nI well I Am a parent as well as having a child so I Need to be engaged [laughter]\nMy favorite hidden piece of the book is the butler and on his he's bringing a glass of blood to his little ward is this by balloon blood is blood I have not I've not specify the kind of what because you have a drawer baboon blood that's for the which Rudnick Beth [noise]\nBut the butler has a band aid on his neck fresh wound [noise] so if you're very perceptive child you may figure out where the blood is coming from that so the butler is a full service butler\n[noise] only the best in what is it about Halloween the truth young euro feels\nWell he doesn't know about Halloween he's a vampire um what what this book really is it's a it's a reverse bedtime story because the vampire boys getting up when it's dark and he's going to bed when the sun rises so everything turning on its head and I think that's what I Love about Halloween is everything is turning on its head\nAlso what about Haight Street [noise]\nYou did a presentation about this book out on ... street at the ... and he would come up with a slide show showing you in your day to day work your work life one of the things that you talk about how one day and it was and how ordinary and you've got an every frame there was a vampire that you couldn't see but everyone else could\nThe kids for white agitated with me [laughter] um I had someone dressed up in a vampire shoot\n'em and I was saying that ah here's my office here's my inspiration there one thing I'm not inspired by our vampires because they do not exist and yet I had the vampire in every frame and they would be screaming with frustration which um is good for children\n[noise]\nWho portrayed the vampire and where do you go to ... street but who portrayed the vamp her\nWith a vampire crouching was from history costumes on hate to give them a plug the vampire was uh my husband who also goes under the name Lemony Snicket so he's now he's no stranger to ... or disguise\nThere's something about flight that is good for children's fantasy as well as adult fantasy you know the idea that you could ride on a broom how fantastic is that an ordinary object is invested with this power the concurring you anywhere in the world a great speeds and almost perhaps even in discipline\nAnd yet you have the page open where they're going looks like the suburbs so it can you can go anywhere in the world and they chose the suburbs but does that say that says that's where the candy is\nWell did you well you\nWas going on the show\n... ... ...\nMm right or that you will you\nDo you get to tell me I'm\n... ... ... well\n... ... what was the one\nI keep school\nWe wanted to read the\nChristmas Christmas with something spooky and strange following leads to brown before that little cocky course has a new recording out called caught me lucky and links to our guests at our website WC about ... oh you're on the west coast live\nBy next gets here are the ...\nAnd I was just start off because I was expecting kits\nAnd they're mature\nElectrical trucks [laughter]\nPretty average the duo tells please walk on the air the west coast live\n\nTheir new album is called Cirque musical plug there ... or they are here with just their own suite guitars the both of you surf I Do yeah ... and you're you're I'm Gail I'm Gail\nYeah I've done a and a look at the beach area and I served down at a place called as appropriate it's old man's down its Saturno free and we are guitars out once in a while like surf music Hawaiian music\nBut uh altruistic and that's Paul and I were to stick and all that great but this this particular deal where who sticks\nSo Paul and you haven't gotten into water you're got wet\nBut because I Know I've been a beach guy all my life I've never been a serious there for like a guilt and some others but actually that's one of the myths about ... music a lot of the ... musicians weren't necessarily surfers\nWhere did you meet did you made it like a beach house that we were touring pause currently with is a far easier to\nPipeline so those are all songs of the early sixties and uh we met on tour he was with the other band I was ... days and we decided that it was kind of cool too are jammed together and do\nThose songs acoustic early so that's the way it started that's my story in the door does a west coast\n[noise]\n... ...\n...\nNa\nNa na na na na na\n...
