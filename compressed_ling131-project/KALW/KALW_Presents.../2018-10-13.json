U. C. L. dot ORG you can sign up for the mailing list there\nMy next guest here came to a great public recognition through his novel norm answer his other books include comes zero Mona Lisa overdrive burning chrome virtual life\nAll tomorrow's parties and pattern recognition he's also been involved in films and television in many ways he is also the gentleman who coined the phrase cyberspace and his books have been both prescient examinations of our culture and very thoughtful examinations of who we are in our time\nAs well as compelling books pattern language is a splendid story we please welcome William Gibson\nThank you very much for coming out on the road is your life as a writer normally very quiet and\nVery very quiet I I I work in a basement that I go out and have lunch and looked at live humans and then I go back and work for more have dinner with my family go to sleep cycle through it but every three years I come out and do this\nOr what kind of stories to tell your children at night to what do you choose to read to them well\nSeeing as how they're twenty five and twenty\n[laughter] wasn't let's move back a bit entire [noise]\nWell [noise] we actually had a we we I had a very rich\nCulture of a family uniquely family story telling going on when my when my kids were little I I used to tell my daughter this endless saga about a character called the boneless Baron B. [laughter]\nBecause there was a butcher shop in our neighborhood that had a permanent sign up but said boneless bearing the beef and every time I walked by it imagined this guy\nHe was French or\nJust completely fluid [noise]\nAnd I told her that he lived in in the bottom\nDrawer of a very very elaborate chest of drawers and in his castle\nAnd it just sort of he unfolded from there and went on for years\nHow did it end it's still\nGoing on yeah sometimes if she has a bad day I I you know resurrect the Baron\nThe boneless bearing the beef yes with which which must have a ... they didn't have any kind of properties of being a cyborg\nMm no it was more like a ... film than science fiction and [noise]\nIt has a it also has quality of one of the writers who I sense has been an influence in your life for the ...\n[noise] it yeah I suppose it's ...\n[laughter] tell stories to your children get gets you into like circular time and the doctrine of the eternal return all of that [noise]\nAnd and your kids kept the straighter they ask you questions about these are these phenomena\n... no they just lay there looking stunned\n[laughter]\nAnd if they didn't go to sleep I told them and the other way [laughter]\nAnd then would you go back down to your uh in into your writing room and say I've got to put this down it was just a a story the king stream of consciousness to you as you were telling it\nOh it was it was total am proud of it ... it was bedtime bedtime story improv but my daughter my son so much but my daughter picked that up\nAnd I think she sort of learned how to do that and I I don't know what effect that's going to have on her but she's got that going on like she knows that you don't make stories up you just sort of get out of their way and let them happen\nIs that how you you find a pattern recognition came into existence\nThat's how everything I've ever done has has come into existence if if the guy who's talking to you now wrote\nA story it would be a very bad story ah I have to turn up every day and wait for that guy who actually writes stories\nHe's pretty good at it but he's he's really flaky [noise]\nAnd he won't always turn out but so you know the best I can do is just be there every day in case he\nComes on the line and and the story starts happening\nAnd do get along with this guy who shows up sometimes are not\nNo not entirely he he's a frequently like too\nWeird I I'm kinda like like no don't don't say that [laughter]\nI don't like the way this is going serious so it's not and not like channel leg\nRight it's a it's nothing like that it's that\nIt's sort of like am forester said that a novelist to was in control of his characters wasn't really\nDoing his job and I read that when I was in college and took it took it right the heart and and\nI felt that way ever since the process has to be out of my conscious control in order\nTo produce the stuff that experience has taught me other people most in joy\nWhen you when you are traveling and looking out the window and keeping notes and do you see them for instance you talk about the children's crusade of Camden Town where the initial part of your novel is is set of\nYou spent some time clearly in London you've watched the the people go back and forth a phrase children's crusade the idea of young people flowing back and forth on this street a limit how did that image come to you\nWell I had seen them flow back and forth in that street countless times over the past Fifteen or Twenty years and it never occurred to me to think of it as the children's crusade\nUntil I was riding the description of that in in the book\nI suddenly thought as that I think it probably had something to do with having read Peter ... wonderful book London the biography\nI don't think he uses that phrase but some something about his description descriptions of of London and a Fifteen to sixteen\nGarcia and mass ...\nSomehow pulled that pulled that phrase a\nIt's a it's it's descriptive and throughout the book you deal with issues of is it conspiracy or is it coincidence a there seems to be a room and the subsidy both in our lives\nWell that\nPsychological term at the Phoenix area which I had never run across before I wrote this book and like right now I can tell you where where I found it that way which is\nThe perception of patterns that perception of meaning where there is no meaning the perception of significance where there isn't necessarily\nSignificance ... was very him became very important to me when I was writing this book because I had started looking at pattern recognition as the essential human activity\nThe thing that distinguishes us from almost all of the other critters on this planet and which we do apparently better than any other critter on the planet\nAs far as we know as far as we now so the idea that there was an inherent potential\nFlaw in that fascinated me the the idea that if we're so good at it we're also revolved hon to seeing patterns that aren't there and that that might be part and parcel of being human\nBut there's also a a a for instance new romance or when you were working on that book or you were always into it and he went to see Blade Runner a movie that a sort of did not do well at the time and you walked in and you looked at the movie and you saw\nThe art design of the of the film and\nWe're concerned that your book it was something about transcending your book in a way which it did not but there was something going on in the\nCommunal culture of that suggested that somebody in Hollywood be imagining a set design that look like out a way of life and the future and that neural Mansour was also have that same kind of a feel a I mean how do you think that kind of a\nIn the the museum of kind of ... technology consumer technology that nobody was ever going to get and the reason that happened is that we already have it\nWe're already there we just don't realize it but that's what kept people from going out and buying those those gloves and goggles says that if you're if you're paying enough attention to your computer monitor you don't need these kind of cutie infested things around\nHer head [laughter] actually they talked about the ... factor that people who that people have failed to become\nThe man who invented men and women who invented television afterwards when I said what didn't happen what do you think it was nice it was the ... factor nobody wanted to like put on somebody else's VR helmet\nIt's amazing that libraries having closed down people borrowing books with other people have had who knows where in\nTheir house yeah but those are I tracks you can't you can't get anything from other people's eyes tracks [laughter]\nLittle traces that that are invisible traces on the page when you as sat down and ah and thought about pattern recognition their number of icons that that come up a there's the Curtis calculating machine a\nWhich is being sold from a trunk and so hold or other kinds of brand name issues that come up a there's a wonderful mantra of where case when she gets into a stuck pattern in their head says I took a duck it two hundred and fifty miles an hour or through the windshield\nOf I mean these these wonderful kind of catch phrases and images a populate your book and give it I'm I'm\nSort of a residence that seems to go beyond the book itself into your own experience\nWell each of those each of those aspects of the book\nBears some sort of one on one relationship to something I've encountered in in my life and often in my life during the time that I that I'm writing a book that the duck in the face mantra came from a story that a friend of mine who's who's\nBeen an airline pilot for years ... told me about why what happens when\nYou get a a a duck you're taking your climbing out of ... Sioux City in it that kids the windshield of your of your airplane than it was just this horrific story of this friend of his ... like the\nWindshield him but the windshield imploded and glass was driven into the guy's guy and he\nThe cockpit became a hurricane and he may he managed to land safely any recovered and went on to fly with like ... glass in his eyes but it but this phrase that my friend has a you know he took it back in the face it a hundred and sixty not\nJob that it jumped out at me and my head because I had this\nCharacter had this this tonality to personality that that sort of it had a kind of a kind of OCD feeling to it somehow it seemed right that she would have uh\nWhat what do you mean OCD feeling obsessive compulsive disorder [laughter] so I wanted the the mantra to seem a ...\nWanted to be obsessive so that the times in a book when she can't not say it out loud and the other characters got what\nYou deal with email correspondence in in the book and websites and people trying to connect in various places of of the world how did you uh imagine the continuity structure of the story how did you\nUm because one of the aspects of emails and Web sites as it in and visiting them is that our live in our times become kind of fragmented and they jump from one place to another uh how is a writer do you manage to think about those issues in and maintain a narrative\nThrough a through line of of your story what kind of choices do make\nWell I had ... one of the parameters I set for this book was that that I Would have only a single viewpoint character which is actually something I haven't done before that you would always be in her point of view and you'd never cut away to that\nCut away from that to the point of view of another character\nAnd I found that a temporal quality to the Internet life really really handy because I could stay in her\nFictional narrative real time and yet when I needed to to break that break that up for the you know just for the for the sake of interest in them I could have her get online and\nAt that moment realistically all of this interesting correspondence with arrive which is very much like what happens in real life but as a as a literary can convenience it's fabulous\nAnd the idea of a of a mirror worlds worlds that are similar but but different or for instance you describe England as as a country\nThat like Japan made so many of its own things its own items that its window pains of different it's tea pots are different not to mention select trickle system that the way pens or sugar packets of it's it's kind of like our world but it's different in for a long time it remained\nInsular yet uh nowadays countries are importing objects culture from from elsewhere it's or was that kind of member quality be maintained\nIt seems to be going away and that causes me causes me some sorrow\nBecause the the Europe the Europe that I see now when I go there it's not really the Europe that I saw [noise] Twenty years ago but that's just change and there's nothing you can do about it you can't have changed without loss and you can't have\nNews things with that changed [noise]\nAuthor of pattern recognition\nMore on humans and technology from the first designer of the Mac icon Susan care own you're on we Gibson's observations about how we recognize patterns this is west coast lived for more information WC of orgy\nMy great pleasure here to introduce the designer whose work\nHas seeped into all of our neurons overtime you may not have a Mac but she's also designed for windows icons\nShe's also designing for cell phones and we're going to talk with her about design and how it seeps in to remind we please welcome the creator it's now been some Twenty years of the happy Mack the wristwatch the trash can file folders and many other icons that have become an integral part of our lives that are visual sensibility please welcome Susan care\nLook at some of her work on march Susan care home care with Cary thank you very much\nYou're welcome thank you for inviting me appreciate it what what art do have on your walls uh have all kinds of images folk art big map a squad valley\nUm I\nThink a fish with wings from Bali that I bought somewhere eclectic\nThe but nothing to depicts a somebody who spends her time working with very tiny amounts of pixels seven point phones how do you create image and sensibility and a hundred pixels were less\nPlow I say I spend all my day's journey dots off and on one by one and a a really good program or a friend of mine ... he said well season that's what I Do it that way at least you don't do one at a time [noise]\nAnd you do it one of the time in order to try to get in shape and shot oh this must have been a challenge Twenty years ago when you were first trying to uh people of apple had asked you to come up with ways to a direct images process was on the screen when\nI first started I'm a programmer ... Andy hurts fell invited me to he said go ahead and get some graph paper with the smallest squares you can find because we just need some images to try out on this new computer and that's what I did and then we gradually they wrote up\nA bit math editor so it wasn't quite so so much of it is it or it is that obviously coloring in a square in a racing it after you look at the whole thing isn't very efficient way to do that but I Do you know I I used to say I pay attention to every dot so I Do like to look at everything magnified just like big graph paper and\nUm you know I I've ...\nComing out of an art background I still find it very much like making art and designing but\nIf you love smearing globs paint across canvas as you are a form of expression you probably wouldn't like bit editing much much much more like ... or needle work or what kind of that kind of technique\nI've sort of at work when I was even photographs of truck clothes for instance or works of his uh where in fact you have to stand forty feet away to see the whole image but when you get closer you see the individual bits and pieces of it and that that somehow if you've used them we are the opposite of what you do because he's got a large you've gone tiny\nWell small solutions to a big problem [laughter]\nWhat a ... so much fun history is designed to of read ability and how does how do you shape you know the curve of a letter to make a legible and if you're working with such tiny amounts\nI'm having a picture of the hardware in general I think it's good not to have pictures of hardware so that when I think about the things that don't work so well anymore it's like yeah having a three and a half inch desk\nTo mean storage isn't so good yeah I Try and steer clear of representing anything hard it is even a monitor because if you want to go for a longer throw\nThe number of composers are also working with the shoes of cell phones for writing tunes and it's kind of look very Bernard bird I mean you're working with a limited tones structure which as you working with limited pixels or do you collaborated with with musicians agreed on a cell phone package music can visuals\nNot too far but I think that would be great I'd love to do cell phone games too because as soon as I observe that gets a lot of work out at least in our family but um\nHow your thumbs holding up pretty good you know you've you've brought a couple of things along her to show our radio audience [laughter]\nYou know I just brought this case as kind of a portfolio book so I thought if we needed if I forgot what I had designed I Would have to remember\nIt's Kara dot com it's a ... or ... dot com thank you I really appreciate my only work you've done but coming to the show today\nThanks again so much that\n\n\nYou're listening to west those laws [noise]\nMy name is ... my ring so at the keyboard [noise]\nMetro home and at the controls before Susan cure the Mac was the apple two out of that come about Willie rebut the story of one of the creators of now presented by west coast live\nMy next guest actually worked on automated systems for a while for how sliding and perhaps we should have him help us [laughter]\nAlong the way he figured out how to get letters into video inputs when he was three years old he later went on him he developed circuit board designs and developed the apple two or apple bracket one way of apple bracket the other way\nComputer and with Steve Jobs started the apple computer company he has a memorial that he's put together with Gina Smith the book is called I was actually he's still is we please welcome Steve Wozniak\nI mean it's like you're everything I Want right except for seven words\nWell I'm not sure that the ideas the fleeting expletive as ... goes and it was an incidental it was accidental live show I mean if we found a group of aliens and they were talking as if any alien said why weren't they stole them and put them away and kill him and all that when they come to us we'll show you what civilization is [laughter]\nWe came close to that here in this country may still be there at some point again but I was fascinated that there were a couple of things that you wanted to be famous for it and most predominantly it was the creation of dial a joke in the in the bay area\nThat's always been true yeah that was a tough thing to do because that was Nineteen Seventy two and it was a time when you could not in the United states you could not legally bone purchased or use\nA telephone you I think that was an FCC will have your own and you could not own use or purchase an answering machine of your own\nAnd so you had the least the one answering machine that the big phone company supplied for theaters we have lots of money so that the answer machine costs as much as my apartment rental you don't have as a young student still in college even working as a\nYoung engineer and that's pretty steep when your apartment rental is double but I Want to do it so badly I just grew up with this whole sense of humor and feeling it was important in the labs that people to good places you know and I can't stop a lot of the bad things in the world but at least if I make a few more laughs I've done my part\nBut the diner jokes and you have you tried it out in front of the joke book and you told jokes there was a time when you were telling polish jokes and you heard from the Polish American cultural society\nYou know the most successful joke book ever in the United states was the official polish Italian joke book by Larry wild and start to polish jokes and then the Polish American Congress got upset the polish people were being disdain and I said what if I change them telling jokes and they said that's fine [laughter]\nSeventy two so as you know no political\nCorrectness yet in the mid seventies there was a radio station in public radio station in San Francisco area which carry a lot of very sort of specialized programming and they carried a show called the polish cultural our and after a while it was cut back to thirty minutes\nAnd it was still called the polish cultural our\n[laughter]\nEvery time I had to announce that that's just telling it and it is it's just totally funny and you could ... yeah you could get accused of oh we're making people bunch of people very upset you met your first wife through dial a joke\nThat's actually true um I was one of those shy people shy nerds and I would probably never meet a girl and my wife\nWouldn't know how to get married of course I knew that eventually I'm going to be just a stable normal person and have a home in a family and all this but there's a little problem in there I'm not going to able to meet girls but then I had to tell a joke and I was in ... I was the first chat rooms and so I can come home from work and turn off the machine and take calls live added\nAll this is family what can I tell you today and I actually met my mentor medical in my first wife yeah [laughter]\nI mean she put up with my humor\nThe first of three successful marriages according to remember\nThat's right I'm very I was I was recently speaking at a um jewelry convention of jewelry people and I said I'm I should be your hero in I've been married three times and they all applauded\n[laughter]\nYou'd also start out with the belief that you would have won marriage in one job you're going to stay at Hewlett Packard a all your life that was where you were dedicated ... devoted\nYeah and I say I really said there in my heart to end but Hewlett Packard is change runs thought the old you'll at Packard and more than the new\nOne along the way you discovered that you have this great gift for designing computers you would get computer design skim addicts in your head and you would create chips in and make things as efficient as possible in relatively short order\nDon't like to say unfortunately it's true but you are wrong to say that it was three years old it was like two countries [laughter]\nThat was actually believe it or not ten eleven Thirteen pretty much yeah I had it all down and designed\nThere's tons of all the computers that you'll at Packard sold and very unfold\nDigital equipment sold and data journal sold all my versions and boy did I get skilled from that just\nTrying to beat myself and do better and better designs with fewer and fewer pieces and I would say to this day I tell companies if you have your employees challenges to do something that may not even have to work project but try to do it if you were programming steps or fewer parts than someone than anyone else could possibly come up with and you know you put people through that\nFor a couple of years and they get extremely skilled or coming up with techniques it couldn't be put in the book\nOne of the things that was a a important about that saves you a Packard was the doughnut and coffee trolley that came around\nAnd that was very delightful twice a day twice a day that don't and coffee trolley came along and we all gathered in one little place all the people on the same for\nThe normally don't talk to each other gathered sorted thought to hear each other and chat and hear what other people are saying even if you're not talking directly with them and I just love that little socialization time there's a lot of us engineers just you know our on our own independent and you know inside\nWhat about the role of pranks when you were growing up but I mean just to kids sometimes are now getting in trouble for pranks\nYeah my mom always said have a sense of humor and I think she meant laugh at jokes but to me it meant played jokes [laughter]\nYes and I found out that because I have a skilled electronics in the early ... you could make devices that other people didn't know people other humans could make and you could trip them and make them think where things were happening in the world where it was just an electronic device doing it the TV jam or in class but the generals who get much of a first year college yeah\nBuilding with a little high speed transistor break in tune with my some nail it little device that held in my palm no one would see it in the dark room a college\nStudent and the court t._v. picture would ... up\nAnd a friend of mine hit the TV\nAnd and then I made a good [noise]\nAfter that I jammed it again and he would hit the TV harder and harder and eventually that for weeks they station one person next to that TV [noise] whenever went bad it was their job to tune the tuning controls and fix it 'til at work and then I discovered I could make it work when their body was touching the TV and fail when it wasn't touching\nSo I I was able to start controlling them just like your control trading maps strange things that amaze you know run around the circle three times in the dark this way and run this circle the opposite direction two times and they get the cheese you could trained to do anything I had these people one time I sat there with a hand in the middle of the TV screen for half an hour during the mission impossible because it made the TV work\n[laughter] I should have had a psychology credit [noise]\nDid you ever get caught never got caught that one and I'm so amazed I had them sometimes holding the antenna up in the air and it would work for a while and then they'd have to climb on a chair\nAnd then I'd have to stand on their tips throws and they never once assumed that another human being in the room was doing it I was good them [laughter]\nSo you keep a good straight face in the midst of a [noise]\nA joke as a favorite of my six year old would you do when you see a space man\nI don't know park in it\n[laughter] I Will remember that one that's a great show\nWhere you broken hearted when apple ... computer from its name\nOf course not of course I mean I think any company can have a you could probably think", "station": "KALW", "city":
