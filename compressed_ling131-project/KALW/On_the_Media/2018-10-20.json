constantly on the brink of being that kind of enlightened reformed progressive society you know regardless of which came which monarch happens to be in power at the time they're always just aspiring towards something but just never quite seemed to get there\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone over the past decade Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive I Can't\nRun for the most powerful

since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nThis war and I want to start with questions about your Native American heritage knowledge that you listen to yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself in those director even from Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born up until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are all my brothers are my family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced\nShe set because she votes where I was in ... that she was Native American\nIn July he escalated\nI Want a million dollars for your favorite charity for trouble\nIf you take the test but it shows you earn it there\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minutes ... campaign video in it and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nThe ... genome we did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence [laughter]\nThis was probably not what Warren had anticipated she\nCame out and thought she scored it first showed the media and it's sort of the men and got old Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that her you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interest\nFrom both the right and the last appropriate them accusations that she's not native enough\nThat she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms that she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bomb a ...\nA political miscalculation but also a stun into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim Paul ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claimed to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage chance fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at the tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but Don Wildman act with the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has a household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous community didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people and their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment to govern\nOn the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds\nYeah when you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examined\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rap the whole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... will defend rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of American telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about\nIn order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nBut but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that Jeanette\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that it's so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that is very racialized thinking\nAnd again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us but we also have this much more powerful way of identifying that's about can ship and tried and citizenship that helps us mitigate some of the\nAlondra thank you very much to pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of\nDNA race reparations and reconciliation after that you know [noise]\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twin disease on me [noise] on the\nMedia is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart\nAvailable on apple pie casts or wherever pond Cass are found\n... of the cutting edge of Celtic roots music absorb influences and styles from the Celtic hotline around the world with all of the music when it takes this week on the ...

attend the unreal these study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they would\nBuilding would have gladly taken too so to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I did\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space while a swing lived on earth ... had to deal with this\nScott Kelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronauts in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore but you are in faith has already made got two inches taller than his brother\n... seven percent of Scott James or not return to normal after he returns are on from years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins\nThe space travel altered genetic expression it did not old and the and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material and returned to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out\nI think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other and identical twins where it apart or identical twins are different in some way\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow is an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories were amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical costs\nEven the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things\nIn terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in\nThe small town who should have been raised in Bogota went and got himself
