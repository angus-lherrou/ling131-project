me\n\n[noise] welcome back to la frightened center I'm Josh barrel your center and business columnist at New York magazine on the right just him Carney commentary editor at the Washington Examiner on the left Elizabeth rooted columnist at the Washington Post and our first special guest today is James Kirchick he's a visiting fellow at the center on the United states and Europe at the Brookings Institution\nAnd a columnist for the Daily Beast\nWell the story they seem to be going with is Rogan killers ... a columnist for the Washington Post and former Saudi insider turned a critic of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman disappeared after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second\nThe Turkish government says it has obtained an audio recording of his interrogation and torture death and just remember Mitt\nGruesome details of which were published in the New York times at first the Saudis in such a good show he was alive but missing but now they've been working on an excuse whoever killed him wasn't authorized to do so by the crown prince and when I say they don't just mean the Saudis the president has been helping along with this line\nLike they should have been known to the bottom of it very flat denial\nLiz I Want to start with you this was your colleague what do you make of this\n[noise] yeah it's really shaken us up I'm at the post you wrote for op eds that to my section on the road for carrying a tia who is my colleague and it's a fantastic writer and editor\nUm I mean a you know it's uh it seems like the story that was published in the times are with regard to what happened to him ... is probably\nClose to the truth right it it doesn't really strain credulity I'm I'm a little bit skeptical of the footage the audio footage of what happened having been transmitted by apple watch to a phone seems more like the Turks probably just have the conflict bugged 'em but\nUh it it's extremely disturbing and uh and it's something that um he has to be kind of a flash point and it's it's it's escalating quickly\nJudy the remarkable thing here for me is obviously\nA lot of terrible things over time and yet they've been a close important ally of ours for a number of decades what is the case for the Saudi alliance what do we get from aligning ourselves with this government that that we acknowledge does a number of things that we think are quite bad\nWell they are one of the world's biggest producers of oil and we will still does matter it's not earning less as the United states is fracking and there are alternative sources of energy but it doesn't matter\nAnd they also are are are Maine's Arab strategic ally in the middle east in terms of containing Iran which is a revision this power it's an anti American government anti Israel\nThere fomenting warns stability across the middle east and the Saudis generally are on our side in pushing back against Iranian influence that's the case for it is that worth it are we getting enough out of this deal that is that it's worth putting up with all this bad behavior by the Saudis I mean this is a very\nDifficult neighborhood and that sounds like a cliche but it's but it's true and you know you're not going to have a bunch of Jeffersonian\nDemocrats with you if you're dealing with Saudi Arabia um I Do think it's an important alliance is worth preserving but this is the sort of behavior that cannot go unpunished and there should be reprimanded for this and look this is the kind of thing that the Russians are the north Koreans do you know killing\nCitizens on foreign soil this is not something that the Saudis have engaged in you know and until now and now they're joining the ranks of you know of countries like Russia and North Korea Tim what feels\nThere are I mean a lot of financial inducement they receive a massive military aid arms deals all of these things to be on the table and they have been in the past when there's when they've been issues with with with Saudi Arabia and I think I'm certainly that should be on the table\nBut this sort of thing can become a precedent where we can just be you know murder by countries and diplomatic postings around the world\nBut hasn't the president made that impossible I mean he's been out there with comments talking about how important do you think's the arms sales relationship between us and Saudi Arabia is would make it hard for him to credibly threaten to cut that off\nIf you recall diplomats for we don't even have an ambassador in Saudi Arabia and if you if you recall other diplomats that's supposed to be basically a symbolic thing saying you know we're very mad at you but when the president does out there sending signals that he doesn't really care about this does that symbolism of moving the diplomats around me\nI think it does have less with this particular president because there's been less of a um of a of an emphasis put on diplomacy and there's sort of this kind of weird um diplomatic style of this particular president but we often see the use of east seems to say things\nThat have been put in his head by the last person I spoke to him I think that's what we saw with the statement that you just played a couple of minutes earlier about the road killers you've probably heard that from someone just repeating it I think if secretary Pompeo and and uh Mr bolt in the national security advisor both of them are serious people and and who understands that American credibility\nIs on the line here this is an American residents not a citizen but a resident who wrote for one of our major newspapers\nAnd try to persuade the president this is not just a slap in the face the United states also an insult to him I mean if this President Trump this is the first country he visited his as president Saudi Arabia is really oriented American foreign policy away from you know cozying up to her on his last president and then moved back to the traditional\nPosition of being closer to our Sunni Arab allies in Israel so\nPrison terms invested a lot in this relationship we just had NBS through this whole tour of the United states so I you know if I were secretary Pompeo and try to make the case personal to him that you know you've invested a lot in this relationship and this is this is an insult to you and you need to exact some sort of tribute ... I'm In in response\nYeah who knows what the president's national interests are and whether that to overriding a chef Jamie Kirchick I Want to thank you for joining us thank you I Will be back with Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner and lose brunette of the Washington Post talk about Congress was full of front and center\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page or tweet us at LIC KCRW and download the KCRW at to listen to left right and center on demand [noise]\nWhite House correspondent April Ryan clashed with Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer and was put on a black list for asking President Trump if he's racist\nIn her new book under fire is reporting from the frontlines of the Trump White house she talks about the challenges of covering this administration April Ryan joins us to look ahead to the midterm elections this week on days [noise]\nTomorrow at twelve noon heroin KLW San Francisco\nAnd tomorrow you can join KLW for a signature blend of music in story telling by bay area journalists writers and entertainers\nAs part of San Francisco's lick crawl the closing night event for the ... quake festival here from Liz Mac with snap judgment actor Don Reid\nHospice Maria Jose Monti Hillary another\nFive PM tomorrow at the chapel in San Francisco's Mission District information and KLW dot org\nBack again with left right and center I'm Josh barrel of New York magazine and MSNBC on the right is Tim Carney commentary editor at the Washington Examiner and on the left is Elizabeth Rubik columnist at the Washington Post\nAnd we're now joined by Burgess Everett congressional reporter at Politico Republicans are hoping to retain their majority in next month's elections and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has his pitch about why voters should keep them in power is extraordinarily\nWe wish list for many years of just about than daughter with tax reform to regulatory reform to Supreme Court justices eighty for\nA lifetime appointment to the courts is terrific period of your life America right of center at obviously that's what I prefer\nTim is he right is this the successful Congress for conservatives\nBut I mean the main thing they ran on was repealing Obamacare and Obamacare still fans so in that way it's a failure bought the the tax cut that acts in some ways as a tax reform by reducing corporate rates and increasing the standard deduction for\nIndividuals I think is good for the economy it's one of the things that are Republicans also run on and a succeeded\nAnd confirming the conservative justices to the Supreme Court and judges to the lower court is really the main thing that most conservatives were looking for from Trump and a Republican Congress so it's it's a mixed bag with taxes and judges is worth quite a lot\n... I keep coming back to something that Corey Lewandowski said I think it's the only smart thing Corey Lewandowski or say ... don't turn out to say thank you\nUm I think we're starting to use some signs that liberals remain outraged about the cabinet confirmation about any number of things the president has done but the conservatives who got their way on Kavanaugh are not necessarily clawing up the walls to turn out and say thank you\nYeah I mean it's hard to predict um you know there was some speculation that the Kavanaugh hearings\nA would sort of inflame a conservative participation coming election\nUm and I can test and they see that as possible\nUm and and there were also polls around the time and Kevin confirmation that showed that the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats actually married pretty substantially um so uh you know whether or not that trend will continue or will will turn out in the in the exit polls I'm\nA certainly hope that uh that Democrats or or or independent to lean left get out and not and vote and are already registered because a lot of those deadlines bypassed\nBurgess I Want to know what you make of this interview in the context of the message that the president has been trying to send in the lead up to this election because the president is clearly wants to talk about a different set of issues he wants to say the Democrats are for crime and weak borders and if you elect them you're going to have chaos and mobs in the U.S\nIt's very different from the economic agenda that Republicans in Congress tend to say they want to run on\nYeah and I I actually think you're probably in more of the Trump rhetoric in an advertising campaigns at least you know like over the phone it in the Senate races and the conservative state where most of the battleground or this cycle it's really sort of culture wars is what you're seeing\nA you're really not seeing people don't run ads on circuit court judges ah you're not seeing much on tax reform\nAh but you are seeing a lot of stuff about just in cinema ... was a liberal activist back in the day or that Bill Braniff in a fantasy of former governor is gonna be a vote for Chuck Schumer I mean I think you're just going to see sort of this base turnout\nUm culture wars style ad dominating these things so [noise]\nYou know senator McConnell's probably not going to be talking about this stuff as much but even if you listen to his rhetoric you know you you've heard about the the liberal mobs that the Republicans talk about um with regard to the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd I I think that's a larger play that Republicans are saying you know they're not saying shake up Washington are saying keep it out of it and don't let the liberals takeover essentially\nAnother matter that McConnell addressed in this interview that is really caught people's attention were some comments that he made about rising budget deficits he says he is concerned about higher budget deficits but he doesn't blame the big Republican tax cuts\nIt's very disturbing it as it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend\nThe you have the president out there saying that Republicans are the ones we're going to protect your Medicare Democrats are going to ruin it by imposing some sort of single payer system if McConnell is out there saying this you know what Republicans seem to be essentially trying to deny that they're going to try to cut these entitlement programs at some point that it was like a negative message for Republicans in this campaign\nI consider myself pretty close McConnell watcher he's been saying for years uh it's the timing of it that matters and so while he's sort of on the victory tour actor confirming cabin uh uh I think you know he did sort of get a bit off message and start talking about entitlement programs and this is where Democrats have\nMade the bread and butter of their campaigns ah ever since I started covering Congress you know twenty fourteen twenty twelve twenty ten ... this is where Democrats feel most comfortable so I think in that sense Democrats feel like McConnell handed them a gift but\nI have not seen paid ads on the yet I'm not sure if there's going to be time to cut them maybe there is but it doesn't feel like\nRight now that the ground has shifted entirely just because of the comments of the Senate majority leader is made Republicans will basically tell you if Trump isn't saying it it doesn't matter nearly as much they're not trying to fame McConnell's words don't matter but they're trying to say how much bigger microphone\nTim going back to the question of whether this was a successful Congress for conservatives in theory conservatives were supposed to want to shrink the government and they cut taxes\nUm but in the long run if the government keep spending money that has to be paid for one way or another ... Republicans are supposed to be in favor of cutting these programs one is it that they actually intend to do that\n[noise] no I think that's a great question um I remember a time when spending was legitimately going down when I first became a a political reporter and it's when we had a Democratic president Bill Clinton\nWhat what do we make of the CNN report about this new department of justice investigation a newly disclosed department of justice investigation into at least seven of the eight dioceses in Pennsylvania plus the diocese of buffalo in New York they they called a source familiar with the subpoena the buffalo diocese saying that it sought quote\nDiet fusion documentation regarding pornography taking victims across state lines and inappropriate use of cell phones and social media so a lot of these allegations have dealt with activity from from decades ago that could not be prosecuted but that makes it sound like they're looking for something that would be a lot more recent involved cell phones and social media and pornography\nWell they do have to look at if it's a federal thing they have to look at a federal crime and a lot of um criminal statute is on the state level so and abuse case I mean being not a federal crime doesn't mean it's not serious right a sexual abuse cases tends to be a state level a crime unless it involves crossing state lines\nAnd a lot of uh you know the cell phone stuff but yes if the the the closest thing to sort of\nUm good news to come out of the Pennsylvania documents was that almost all of this was sort of pre two thousand for ... two thousand two when you have lots of the Boston suffer came out and did seem that met most of the reforms that happened\nI had to do with a you know we're a did have an effect of a curbing this abused and so if we do have things that are more recent than that then that would open the wound even farther than it has been opened in the past couple of months\nThink that's exactly right I also think that another aspect of this scandal that's aggravating it or is that in two thousand two two thousand three people were mainly being exposed allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests which is unspeakable horrible\nI'm now we're dealing with the fact that not all of those priests were adequately handled they were not all punished in many cases or they were protected in on a continuing basis up to the present\nAnd we're dealing with the fact that I'm a the abuses seminarians and adults\nAre in the church is being revealed in this round um that's what make Carrick was accused of\nMainly he does have a couple of allegations of abuse of minors um but primarily what he was known for was it ... it was a abusing sexually abusing seminarians a ads and these are you know adult Catholics who are in training to become priests [noise]\nUm I think that's new that's further aggravated things the churches unwillingness to deal with\nThe abuse or an exploitation of adults and its care or you know being sort of live about that uh is is also extremely disturbing I think that probably the worst possible thing um\nThat could happen and is already happening which is that\nI'm ... and by worst possible thing I mean worse for the prospects of the American Catholic Church\nAnd that is multiple attorneys general in multiple states opening their own investigations one by one\nOvertime or which means that just sort of on a rolling basis every few years every year we'll get another released like the Pennsylvania grand jury report which will just be a discussing a newly detailed extremely disturbing will prompt\nFurther federal probes uh and so stretching over the course of many many years will essentially\nAlways have news about a sexual abuse in the Catholic Church if there's anything that's ever been custom designed to destroy a church establishment that's it\nIt's called confession I Do it all the time uh and they are the church officials need to open their records they need to confess to what they've done a there needs to be ... ah and if that\nMeans the churches under staffed and that's better than the church banned completely and utterly destroyed from the Pew is up to the altar or over the years by subsequent state and federal investigations immense\nWe believe that there I've been talking with Liz ruin of the Washington Post and Tim corny of the Washington Examiner we will be back with Wesley Morris critic at large for New York times to talk about who's getting canceled listening pull up front and center\nJoin the conversation on our Facebook page or tweet us ...

I mean 'cause if you really ever challenged those people who bought the show was good and what you know we're glad it was on TV\nCouldn't really discouraged if we get you\nThe the gratitude for having the show in the first place\nRate these sort of a counterpoint to your critique it can't be\nYou can't say that because\nBeen so hard to get gay people on TV for so long that just took them seriously as normal people [noise]\nI don't think it's a very useful counter pointed maybe thing I Would say Liz\nOne of the things that I that I see flushed out and unless we say is basically how the moral isn't through which popular culture is discussed is now a moral as I'm coming from the young and coming from the left in a way that you know twenty five thirty years ago you would have had Dan Quayle complaining about you know single parent Murphy Brown on television\nSo as you know as a young left person what do you make of this you know this rise of moral isn't from people who share a lot of values with you having a lot of influence over the popular culture", "show_name": "Left, Right, & Center", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20"}
