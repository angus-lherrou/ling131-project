magazine on the right as rich Lowry editor of National Review on what his honorary Cox hosted with friends like these and columnist for ... and our first special guest living in New Jersey the Washington correspondent for New York magazine on friday\nMorning the FBI arrested a man in connection with the attempted male bombings of critics and opponents of President Trump including George Soros the Clintons and the Obamas so far more than a dozen pipe bombs have been intercepted fortunately but none of them exploding\nThe man arrested in connection with the bombings is a fifty six year old resident of South Florida named stays our ...\nPresident Trump said at a White House event the culprit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law but earlier friday he was complaining on Twitter about how the bomb coverage was affecting the elections he tweeted quote\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this quote bomb unquote stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going off Republicans go out and vote\n... what's the reaction to this day and at the White House 'cause we've seen a lot of comments over the last few days from the right wing fever swamps and I count TV host like Lou Dobbs when I say right wing ... about this maybe being a false flag attempt to make Trump look bad by making it look like somebody's sending bombs\nIs that how people are thinking about inside the White House now that there's an actual suspect in custody\nWell it's difficult to say I mean initially they tried to kind of striking a diplomatic tone I thought after Donald Trump's rally the other night\nPeople were saying they always do that he is somehow pivot that this is a new Donald Trump because he was not outright attacking a members of the price of the normally does that obviously that was short lived I mean you could have predicted that\nAnd now today Donald Trump has uh an event in the eastern it's happening at as as we talk right now\nI'm at say a young black leadership sentiment and he's talking about I can just owing on stage at who just a few days ago called this a false flag attacked basically and so I think that\nAny hope that he would respond to this differently than we would have expected if it's probably faded away by now\nAs for how people in in the White House feel I mean you saw some of some of I think that the true feeling coming through when you when Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked CNN after they released their initial statement ah from from Jeff Zucker\nA condemning Donald Trump's rhetoric they kind of can't help themselves or even at a moment like this when they should be trying to unify the country or at least a toned down some of the rhetoric that cannot help a fanning the flames and engaging in these fights um and I responded the other day\nWhen Sarah Huckabee Sanders first ...\nFirst responded negatively to CNN just saying like what does this accomplish it's very difficult to see how it helps and uh and it's very difficult to see how it how is that it's going to help the country at all but I don't think that they really care about that I think we've seen that again and again in times of crisis\nIt rich jump shooter from CNN tweeted out a photo of the side of of this guy's van which among other things out of CNN sucks sticker that is a popular chance\nTo get him to just read the report they had tried to include his name and each paragraphs said that he follows me at least follows a through that to the end of the sheet of paper that he's reading looking for his own name were as we sit I think people call that the Washington read\nUh [laughter] but it's also the Donald Trump breeds ... no it doesn't surprise me um but I I think it's it's terribly worrying that you have spies listening in I think one of the most interesting parts of that report by a net Rosenberg and that you have room and\nIs that they're listening not just to get information but to figure out\nTo be most successful who does he really listened to and why did you listen to them I mean that you're\nReading I mean isn't isn't this a scandal I mean parts of it are amusing but even if the president is not reading a classified report the president's own thoughts and feelings and who he listens to his sensitive information\nHillary Clinton got an a lot of trouble for what seems like a you know less significant intelligence breach the Nat how why isn't you know why aren't oversight committees in Congress looking into this isn't this substantively important regardless the politics of it\nIs another one of these stories if there were any other president this would be dominate the next quarter of news and it's just there there's so much in the era of Trump a of a friend who's a national security expert and actually called them before the show so what do you what do you make the story\nWhat's right I I missed this is actually possible the minutes if in today's news environment obviously it's incredibly reckless it's even worse\nBecause it's completely avoidable I mean it's not as though he couldn't call people they would just be logged in John Kelly would know so to\nTake this sort of risk just to avoid your chief of staff knowing is it's it's really hard to get your\nYour um your head around and you know apparently the New York times is right the Chinese are using information from these calls and the friends he was calling to try to influence those friends to influence Trump which is also astonishing and very bad\nFirst of all I continue to argue that the media safest thing for the country would be to turn the White House in ... something like the Truman Show where he can pretend to be president and had like a self contained bubble\nUm and he can watch himself on TV and talk to the people on the TV and they can talk back to him and the other thing is actually if I can quickly ask Olivia based on her reporting do you think there's anything he says on these phone calls that he doesn't say in public\nLike is there anything that he ... himself in public that he would he would just suddenly like reveal in private that doesn't seem possible to me it's just seem impossible\nAnd based on my reporting since he's been in office perhaps the only thing that he would not revealing public our concerns about his family\nConcerns about if the avant garde and Jared Milan yet I'm concerned about the investigation but I think a lot a lot of these phone calls I did a story about his relationship it's a Sean Hannity a few months back\nAnd when I found is that a lot of it it's really just him gossiping him talking about TV ratings and talking about all the things that he cared about during his life in New York um and I I Want us to just add that I think it's ... I keep thinking about the fact that when he first entered office\nOne of the first portraits that they they line the walls of the west wing with\nEverything is terrible and it was Donald Trump on his Android phones to this enormous cell phone to his ear this close up shot at him and I I just think in light of the story that's even funnier than it was at the time\nLiving in New Jersey from New York magazine I Want to thank you for joining us thank you\nI also want to note Olivia on a rich and I will all be together for our show two weeks from now which is going to take before a live audience November seven in New York the day after the election\nWe're doing the show in partnership with my other employer which is New York magazine Olivia and Jonathan Chait will both be there from the magazine so we'll see corn occupy MSNBC understood Herndon from the New York times\nYou're gonna hear that show on the radio you'll hear it as a podcast but if you live in New York or if you feel it coming to New York you get tickets and come see us in person those are available at KCRW dot com slash L R C live\nI've been talking with rich Lowry of National Review and author Marie Cox with friends like these we'll be back with the federal records or five thirty eight to get a sense of what's about to happen in the election they're listening to electric center [noise]\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page or tweet us at ...

friends like these and columnist for ... girls and since we're less than two weeks away from the election we're joined now by Daniel ... who is elections analyst at five thirty eight hind Daniel hey how's it going\nGoing well thank you uh before we get into the specific forecast themselves I Want to ask you about forecasting a lot of people were really mad at the election forecasters after the twenty sixteen election because they felt they'd been told Hillary Clinton was going to win and then she lost\nAnd I know your boss Nate Silver response was basically we didn't say she was going to win we said she was probably going to win has\nReaders learned that lesson or have people has the conversation Ron odds gotten better in that people have an understanding that if you say something has a twenty percent chance of happening it's going to happen one out of every five times\nYeah a great question and I appreciate that you kind of brought that up by herself because these are that the first thing that I Need to say um\nBut ah yeah I think that it's gotten a little bit better I think when we initially launch our house for cats at five thirty eight are the chances that we gave Democrats to pick up the house for roughly the same as what we gave Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and a lot of people I think picked up on that ... that oh well five thirty eight was wrong quote unquote last\nTime even though as you point out you are\nWrong exactly we do have a Trump a thirty percent chance I think people\nAre picking up on the fact that isn't that don't go for a Democrat that that in the height of election eight and I think people always you know round up to a hundred percent make assumptions where they shed\nSo what are we talking about where those forecasts stand with that caviar that forecast is not a one hundred percent production what are the odds looking like for Democrats taking back the house and what are the roads in the Senate\nYeah though according to the factory forecast currently Democrats ... ... and ...\nAre picking up the house at the clock smelly eighty five percent um another thing that we've done is we've started to refer to hang them made it kind of stick them seven or ... then why chances which we think empathize with the fact that one time out of seven Republicans do keep the house\nI'm In the Senate fight it almost the exact inverse there's a five and six chance or about eighty two percent that Republicans keep controlled a so basically Democrat or as much of an underdog in the Senate as Republicans are and how\nRich I Wonder do you make of the president's clear choice over the last few weeks to really put himself front and center in the campaign he decided he should be on TV more he's out doing rallies more frequently and we'll be doing them even more frequently in the week and a half before the election his approval numbers have improved somewhat but it doesn't look like that's translating into stronger numbers for Republicans at least in the house races\nI think a little one is just what he wants to do right he wants to be the center of attention no matter what whether it makes sense or not I think this makes more sense than would have six months ago because the approval ratings have picked up the wall Street Journal poll is kind of ...\nPresident was higher than President Obama was at this point in his first term and in Senate races in particular it's that the a lot of these battles earned Trump territory and he can really help you can also helping some some house races but\nThey're just there are many more house races where he he can't help at all and I think part of the calculation is that you know the Democratic base particularly suburban women they they already have them as much as they are going to hate him there already energized so you might as well go all out try to energize your your\nSide as well so what do you make of that I I hear this a lot basically Democrats were already in a tent on enthusiasm and so at the margin more enthusiasm can only be good for Republicans but then I look and you know that there's all these people who don't vote\nIn mid term elections normally who do vote pretty reliably in presidential elections that means that on both sides are have to be a lot of people out there who theoretically could be gotten devote if there was more enthusiasm\nI can just suspect there's not a lot of talk on the table for Trump I mean I I think that you've he's already got the people who are going to be excited by him coming to town you know what I mean like I think\nThe people that aren't going to vote and the people that he lost our you know college educated suburban women and him coming to town doesn't make them any more than likely to vote for Republicans I think it may make them just less likely to vote they may not want to vote for Democrats or they may incoming may may inspire them to vote for Democrats I\nThink it's a weird play 'em knowing the president he'll he'll probably argue is if they do lose the house that he didn't go out enough\nUm [laughter] I I I I think it's sort of the trees a lot about his thinking that he does really think you know I Alone can fix it and and he's really unwilling to let the Republican Party um localized elections which I don't know if that's a great idea and then the term election editor nationalized everything\nWith every every first Nathaniel\nQuickly how competitive is this race really I Know Nate Silver or are you guys on your website did a qualitative quote simulation where Nate pretended to come back from the future and in the in the simulation where things are really good for Democrats involved Beto pulling it out actually winning this race I Know you guys see that as something that is at least within the realm of possibility\nYeah exactly and am frankly Democrats are going to win the Senate um that one of the main way they would do that basically either they win Texas ... the or North Dakota I personally think North Dakota's of likely but Texas is perfectly\nI'm likely it or not likely but impossible as well I'm currently we give it over a one in five chance Ted Cruz a four and five chance but I mean you can pay those numbers closely mirror overall numbers so yeah in a scenario in which Democrat outperform the older the polls are off by\nYou know three or four points which is a fairly normal polling air historically speaking um yeah that's become a nail biter rate\nUm deathbed based on what we know right now Ted Cruz is\nClearly favored a like you said is leading and all that much but you have to go back to the mid September to uphold that even have the two tied um so ... if you I think a lot of liberals are squinting and paying all medical it out

I think he feel sort of powerless that he's not been able to stop migration efforts\nAt the southern border but as I say it's getting to this has been a complex issue that and it's a policy issue that was that the president inherited from the Obama administration is is a problem that your father was rational to solve the problem\nYou have all these relationships in the region where you need to get the Mexican government to be helpful you would like more stability in the Central American countries so that fewer people would feel the need to try to leave\nAnd so you have a president who who wraps and raves about this and at the same time was threatening to cut off aid to these countries whose revoking temporary protected status for people from Central America in the U.S which is likely to further destabilize those countries including by gang members were in the U.S returning to Central America and causing further unrest in Central America so where's the president's strategy here\nOther than you know yelling and talking about executive orders\nDo one as has been pointed out Mexico does a fair amount and this this area and we need them just as much as as it possibly can which is one reason you shouldn't go out of your way to insult\nMexico or Mexicans to the idea that um ... Honduras than in Guatemala age to be cut off because we're not stopping this migrant flow and they're very few countries in the world that stop people from leaving their country is you know the ...\nAnd states and even if there is that that a will to to do it um there's not the the capacity\nIn in this country so that's entirely miss forgotten I Will say I think this is a legitimate story I think it's a the images are compelling which obviously drives the TV coverage\nAnd it's just not every day you have um a caravan I think maybe as three thousand people at that time basically forcing its way through international border into Mexico so it's right that this does get coverage\nOr I think what tends to get lost the president occasionally hits on this is the problem is we have an enormous loophole and they're all system now ... ah regarding families unions units from Central America and they set foot in in the United states is very likely\nThey're going to stay so it doesn't matter whether they're ... voluntarily surrendering to border agents or if we send an Infantry Division down there they'll just\nThey'll just surrendered soldiers because they'll make an asylum claim a ... almost always the initial credible fear interview is granted and then it takes so long to adjudicate the asylum claim you can't hold them down there there isn't the capacity to do it and they're all sorts of other problems as we learn\nSo then you're you're sent into the United states and they they know that and that's one of the reasons not entirely but as one of the reasons they come in and although all over all the ... down this particular population is growing\nOn what is the liberal position on this caravan and on Central American migration more broadly because David Frum wrote a piece this week basically saying that the Democrats\nNeed to be made to protect themselves from ending up in a de facto pro caravan position this is a this is the policy concern that his inherited from the Obama administration then while the Obama administration loose and some of the rules about who could claim asylum in the U.S they also had this partnership with Mexican Government that was frankly aimed\nAt trying to to to limit the flows of people who would appear at the U.S border and be able to seek these asylum claims I mean of the ... the millions of people in Central America who have legitimate fears about unrest and gang violence and domestic violence in their country I mean do all those people have a valid claim on asylum in the u._s. should all of them be able to come here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Left, Right, & Center", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "27"}
