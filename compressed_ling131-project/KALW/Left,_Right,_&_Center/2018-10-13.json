I Can't tell you how how radicalizing it was for that group to watch this happened and it wasn't about the seat and that was something that I think the left mess is that what happened to Brett Kavanaugh that one guy\nAnd they had stopped caring about the seat at some point I Want to point out it's not just about Kavanaugh at the very fact that people got enraged about patriarchy it's about like ... it's about a whole class of people that they feel like shouldn't be attacked\nSo if it was just about Brett Kavanaugh and then I think people would be much more and ambivalent about whether he should be confirmed it was because he stood right this was the ins and I have to say\nI was a a a a SEC football game two weeks ago and my all my friends who aren't in politics it was crazy that the their wives were coming up to be talking about how bad they were among the husbands were whispering in my ear like was this really that big of a deal I I mean and these are not political people so I actually think it got outside of the extremely all yeah bubble can\nSo I mean I I have a different idea of what it looks like when someone's life gets destroyed because of a criminal defense attorney and what I say is that\nTypically people who have never encountered the system before when they encounter it are convinced that they are the victims of a conspiracy because they cannot conceive\nThat a person can be treated this way unless there was some vast conspiracy so I think what you're seeing as you would certainly make the argument he was treated unfairly you could make the argument he was treated badly but he's treated the way people get treated when they get accused of things in America every day all the time all over the\nPlace I Would like to be destroyed so badly that I was a federal judge [laughter] like a great like he had not even started to testify before the press releases started hitting my inbox saying and teach Brett Kavanaugh from his federal ... a ... and a judgeship so that can vary on line I'm Sorry that's\nLike ... like ... it was like nay Raul and progressive groups it wasn't like ran yesterday in the sense that like those people drive actions\nWouldn't narrowly powerful lobby on the left it's not like some random group of three people sitting in their basement sending out ... I Want to ask about one one more topic but I think may be shaping the run up to the November election which is\nMaybe part of why this whole to soften a little bit for Democrats was that they had a very good poll environment before all this happened or the news had been driven by all of these negative development surrounding the Russia investigation the conviction of Paul Manafort\nA Michael Cohen's guilty plea in the news of of Manafort's cooperation I think maybe solidifying a sense that there was criminality around the president can I I\nI Want to ask you it feels like a quiet time in the mail or investigation right now like nobody's nobody's gotten indicted this week and while I felt like I was going to happen every week it's a quiet time what does it tell you that it's been a little bit quieter\nIt doesn't tell us anything this was what normal looks like you might remember from like twenty Fifteen or so [laughter] it normally federal criminal investigations take a long time\nThe hardest thing often it's talk people look you're just gonna sit around and wait for two years to see if you get indicted\nSo low for a month as nothing we're in this environment where I'm Mueller's investigation is very fast three to four times faster than a\nInvestigation this complexity typically would be a but you know among the law and this type of thing when he's doing things behind the scenes with nothing doesn't signify anything\nOther thing about Brett Kavanaugh themselves Trump that's related to this is is less I think about the excitement among the base but more about the fact that we're talking less about Donald Trump and and\nWas in the news for a given week his poll numbers with ... a little bit because you know while we're a polarized country this is a small percentage of people that hate Donald Trump and also hate the Democrats and so when Donald Trump's on the TV all the time that I like I really dislike the sky\nBut when he's not when Brett Kavanaugh as on TV all the time they start to forget like we've all turned into Donald Trump a little bit we all remember even that now in cycles\nAnd so this habit until he's sixteen where the the Access Hollywood tape happened three weeks elves and and it was like Donald Trump's done and then he behaved for two and a half weeks for him right and and didn't make a ton of news and the Kobe thing happened and and that made a ... a real difference in the end of the twenty sixth in campaign and so\nThere there could be a change like that either in his favor or against in the next three weeks\nWell we'll see if he manages to uh to keep quiet for for that kind of period or Ken white I Want to thank you for joining us like you coming up I'll be back with Megan McCarthy honorary Cox Tim Miller inland Lopez to talk about who's in who's out for Donald Trump Kanye West is in Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell is out there listening to what frightened centralized\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page for tweet us at ...

Lopez who is senior finance correspondent for Business Insider as we tape on Thursday evening the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen Thirteen hundred points in two days and President Trump knows why\nWe have interest rates going up and then flipped that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nWith the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates although not all that quickly and not this week what has happened is [laughter] is long term interest rates have been going up a lot on the open market and that's bad for stocks and it makes it more expensive to get a mortgage but it also might be necessary if the fed is going to have to keep raising rates in order to stop inflation\nMaking is is from right about the fed have they been raising interest rates to much are they screwing up for things for him politically by pushing the stock market out in inflation\nIs not particularly high and you know like the fat likes to to run that anything they want to nip it in the ... I Want to get ahead of it they want to get ahead of of of inflation so like maybe they're a little too tight and it's\nSort of hard to judge trade 'em but\nTo go after them right because then the independence of the Federal Reserve having an independent central bank was a tremendous achievement\nAnd it took decades to build up the credibility that the president does not interfere with interest rates I mean like ... you know Nixon's Federal Reserve was like a little too close with Nixon and that was really bad for the country\nAnd so he should keep his hands off of the bad for the same reason that he shouldn't say many of the things that he says I'm because he is chipping away at really important civic institutions\nThat are important for our economy that are important for a civic society that are important for our democracy um do I expect him to like\nHave a change of heart and realize that challenging that independence was a bad idea no but you know in an ideal world where Donald Trump listen to someone\nI wouldn't do that so that the funny thing here is that the fed at least ... for an institution in Washington seems to basically ignore the president when he runs his mouth like threat so that part or or like arguably one could actually see the fed being like oh yeah you see this proves\nJust to prove that the president is not telling them what I heard that that's like some people's real concern oh well that's this is where this is where the tradition of the president doesn't comment on interest rates comes from it or not it doesn't go back to George Washington we didn't have as you go back back then it's not in the constitution\nIt was the Clinton Administration and the reason they did it was the George H W. Bush spent a lot of Nineteen Ninety two complaining that interest rates were too high\nAnd the fed was too worried about inflation or should be cutting rates\nAnd the perception was that the fed had actually become more reluctant to cut rates because they thought if they did it would look like they had done it because President Bush had told them to so Bill Clinton\nDidn't talk about interest rates not because he was super disciplined and carry out it would actually interfere with the fed doing what he wanted\nGet married [laughter]\nThat same kind of sense of alienation from the black community that sense of I don't want to advocate I don't want to have this responsibility of\nYou know correcting the people that I'm Around because I'm successful this is a burden that every minority who become successful in class and decide whether or not they take on and kind of has decided I'm not going to do it it's too hard I Am a coward\nAnd what do I know right now is called the actress who should be replacing Megan was Conyers for up and we haven't tried though maybe maybe he would agree I don't know he would probably he would probably rap much better than\nMe so used to build some citizen rhyme on us [laughter] okay what am I what am I [laughter]\nI don't know where to go what are we make of Taylor Swift choice to finally talk about ...
