Bruce columnist at the Washington Post and Emily bath long staff writer at the New York times magazine and co hosts the slate political gab fest is also with us as we tape friday afternoon the Senate is moving toward a vote\nOn confirming Brett Kavanaugh the FBI submitted its background check report to the White House on Wednesday and senator started looking at it on Thursday the reaction to the report is mostly broken down on party large Republicans saying the record producers no new corroborating evidence to the allegations against capital\nDemocrats complaining the FBI investigated too narrowly failing to interview key witnesses perhaps at the direction of the White House on a key procedural vote friday afternoon every Republican senator except Alaska's Lisa Murkowski voted to proceed to a confirmation vote\nEvery Democrat voted no except West Virginia's Joe mansion Italy you co wrote an article for the times this week it's been a little controversial you uncovered a police report regarding a dispute in a bar Kavanaugh was involved in a college student at Yale in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nCan you make the argument for us why is this important to Brett Kavanaugh through I used to have someone in a bar thirty three years ago\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's a great question I think on Kavanaugh open himself up to this kind of reporting with his dismissal and minimizing of his drinking and conduct in high school and college and what happened after his testimony a lot of people who knew him then at that time of his life\nWhere I'm really shocked at the way he described himself and the degree to which she was on I think really minimizing is the right word um a lot of hard drinking he was doing and this matters of course because he has completely denied allegations of sexual assault and ruled out the idea that he could have\nDone these things when he was blackout drunk so our story was based on a police report and it just for court at this bar fight incident that cabin on and it's friend Chris deadly were involved in 'em and it just sort of painted a picture of some of what he was up to in college I'm don't fight ended when Chris Lee threw up\nThe hospital that Lee was arrested\nRich or the reaction to this\nArticle from from conservatives it's a it's sort of feel like we've gone through three phases of opposition to judge Kavanaugh at first you had some critics have his were basically like already unduly at an eleven over things like you know credit card balances that changed over the years and a lot of speculating about what that meant about ... about his finances\nThen you had this allegation emerged from doctor for that really merited beat the\nOpposition being at eleven and Republicans look a little bit chase in for a while and then you've had\nMore objections to Kavanaugh about either less serious or less reliable claims about his behavior and Democrats remain at eleven and Republicans this has given them in a window to basically dismissed everything as a witch hunt basically saying you know they they just they're out to get Kavanaugh but even if we stipulate that they're out to get capital I\nMean have have conservatives really dealt with the corps for the allegation and then what Emily describes there it's not so much that it matters if Kavanaugh was in a bar fight thirty three years ago but the he's staked his reputation on certain claims about his behavior and personality such that it's implausible that he could have even been involved in these sorts of things when he was younger don't we sort of\nDemeanor and his part is in attacks\nIn his testimony from the point of view of the legal profession\nThere's a stumbling block here and it has to do with judicial temperament and character and veracity these things we are discussing earlier it's not about the useful conduct it's about how he's handling himself now there are lots of other people who disagree folks like rich he you know they are willing to look past these\nDuring but I think for a lot of people within the legal profession\nWho want to think of the court and in some way at least one step removed from politics and that has been its role at some moments in American history um we do of this idea that the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review has the power to say what the constitution means and that it's made up of people who are not elected\nIf you think that matters then that is very much tied to the courts legitimacy and having such a controversial um confirmation process that ends with on\nAnd that's that's the game that I think a lot of people's minds did not resolve these key questions about sexual assault or about ... that's going to be tough on the court and it may slow down John Roberts on and other conservatives who want to make real changes in a conservative direction to the law\nReally bad one I Want to thank for joining us thanks for having me\nI'll be back with rich Lowry of

Washington Post\nSo I was in high school in the late Nineteen nineties and well Liz makes a case that our politics are stuck in high school our next guest has a case to make\nThat they're stuck in the late Nineteen nineties so I guess maybe this was all ... attacks and I apologize for that Steve ... is a national political correspondent at NBC News and MSNBC and he's written a new book called the red and blue Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism\nHi Steve thanks for joining us Hi Josh thanks for having me\nSo I've watched a Supreme Court nominee discuss under oath what he meant by goofing in his high school yearbook quotes\nWash them sidestep this question about whether he's the board of Kavanaugh and more judges alcohol so memoir watching him contends that ... was not a sexual innuendo about one of his high school college I'm reminded of the debates over what the definition of Israelis\nHow as someone who's just you know spent so much time writing a book about Ninety politics how much of this feels like a Ninety flash back to you\nYes exactly I knew exactly where you're going to I think when you when you started with that because they are one of the defenses of Kavanaugh from these charges that he was being a invasive or untruthful or whatever in his uh\nUh in his appearance last week a you know is that he was making technically true statements that might have left out context or might have been in complete and of course that's what Bill Clinton was famous for doing that would um it it it would it would drive his opponents crazy\nIt really throughout his entire um his entire rise in politics in it and it was something that um you know of course he was in Ninety eight at the beginning of the Lewinsky saga that Hillary Clinton claimed to there was a vast right wing conspiracy that was out to get her husband to get her um one of the things that that that fuel so much of the conservative um\nDistaste for Bill Clinton was you know they call them slick willy his ability to to find some precise lawyer leeway to maneuver his way out of jams with words and then they thought even if he was saying things that were true they thought he was being dishonest well and then the\nThe other thing was that these these lines of questioning that Bill Clinton was invading very often they were about accusations that he had behaved in a way that conservatives considered to be a moral and part of the reason that it was supposedly okay to be invasive or in some cases outright dishonest was that it wasn't anybody's business and you know well he was lying he was lying about sex and it feels like those roles have\nCompletely reverse we're now you have a left that his newly energized around a morality in politics obviously a different set of moral values than the right was focused on Twenty years ago but it's more morality based politics and its conservatives basically saying that a lot of these questions aren't important more often with regard to President Trump\nOn although we've seen some of that with regard to to judge Kavanaugh\nThat's been an interesting transformation to write some literally some of the people who were Bill Clinton's chief critics\nAre from the right on questions of morality and then that is the sort of you know merger of morality in politics you Bill Bennett comes to mind I think notably um had become Trump supporters you know a generation later two decades later a couple of different ways to look at that I guess one of the things that I've I've heard just in having conversations with folks\nWho made that shift you say and you can you can say hey take a look at what you were saying about the importance of\nOf truth in you know in in a in a president the importance of a\nA a moral values and a president take a look what you were saying then versus now what happened one of the things\nYou hear back or at least that I've heard back as the idea that that Bill Clinton um and his defenders you know Bill Clinton his defenders in the media Bill Clinton and his defenders in popular culture they basically succeeded in changing the rules in breaking the system\nAnd and the conclusion that folks on the right some folks on the right\nDrew from that you know a generation later over time is that I'm a hate they don't need a moral exemplar to lead them anymore are they more feel like that the kids on a playground or being bullied and you know when they went out and they found their own bully to fight back and that's how they kind of you Donald Trump by I don't take a position on whether\nThat's the that's the you know it appropriate uh a way to sort of a a process the last Twenty years but it seems like\nSome have rich is that what you've lived through yeah definitely I mean that that's the go to argument and Steve regulations on the book and flood or it's worth I find you one of the most compelling political analysts on television something I'm curious what your take is clearly you know have this enormous divide\nBut George W. Bush after these\nIntense hateful fights Nineteen nineties heap pivoted away from them and said on the lighter not a divider had rocket bomb a famously end of the convention speech that would\nPropel him to fame and eventually the presidency was all about they're not being a red or blue America and he ran on a unifying theme was sort of stands out about Donald Trump because he didn't actually say this word but his his theme was no actually I'm a divider [laughter] you know [laughter] so where where do you think the public is just in terms of\nWanting to get beyond this divide I mean they're obviously everyone's implicated in it or most people are but are are we in a different place because people don't care so much about I'm trying to to get beyond this division or do you think we'll see a Democrat in twenty twenty who who run and that kind of traditional unifying theme these have you Donald Trump\nNo I mean look I I think we have we are conflicted as human beings is one of the things that um that that that sort of occurred to me well well writing this I think on some level we are hardwired going way back for tribalism for tribal thinking for tribal associations and\nIt we we may not like to think it but I I think it's there and I think the way our politics involved in in in not just our politics but the media too and in sort of the way those two things um interact\nThe way it's evolved over the last generation or so just lends itself to tribalism maybe lends itself to you know finding a media source that I'm a ... that you agree with that to shutting out of media source that you don't just surrounding yourself with with voices you find pleasing\nTo identifying herself as part of that group and of course we're not like you know those folks who listen to the other thing or watch the other thing\nUm we we now the media political culture that really caters to that you know we also we we like intuitively and instinctively the the idea of a unifying message we like to believe that we can transcend tribalism that we can transcend partisanship and\nYou know yes Bush in in in two thousand um that was the the promise of his campaign was enough for him to win but you know barely I mean it was it was the closest thing to a\nA perfect time we've ever had a ... in this country when they ever have um you know Obama right there are no red states there are no blue states well I think we found that in the Obama era there are red states blue states\nThere is a red America there is a blue America ah so neither one of them was was able to ah to transcend that either um I I I just think that the bigger problem is you know politics have been a nationalized I'm In a way I don't see how we go back from not just nationalized\nUm they've they've merged with this this this media that just puts those divisions and puts those those tribal distinctions in everybody's face every second of every day and every second of every day you're confronted with a choice of which side of my own and and that's\nI take it as a given the Democratic energy is is is there in November what does that do to this this sudden burst of energy Republican suddenly have they've been they've been trying so hard to create it and they've got it or does it endured as it just does it just stayed out\nYeah in terms of timing the Access Hollywood tape was what October October seven read

I mean last week on this show not not to pick on Evelyn Evelyn Marcus was saying that she expected that these talks would drag out for quite a substantial period that the U.S and Canada we're quite far apart\nIs is this an area you know the president is always going around saying he doesn't get get enough credit has not been given enough credit here where he sort of had this whole new China shop approach and it's not clear that he's gotten huge changes and he definitely\nHasn't gotten the turn away from the global free trading regime that he claims to oppose\nBut he does seem to have gotten incremental changes that are at least from his framework favorable to the United states [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the thing that Trump's effective or in some unusual way is right just because he's willing to to do politics and unusual way I'm it reminds me of the things that are conservative say about Reagan or that sort of Reagan struck the global stage as being unstable enough\nA to a elicit certain changes at a worry of what he would do with others didn't cooperate I think Trump maybe strikes a similar note I'm I I don't know it's his base and it's going to be altogether thrilled\nI'm with you know having a new NAFTA Senate old NAFTA um but you know as as far as they're willing to give them credit for incrementalism I'm sure there please\nIt rich that's the funny thing here that ultimately Trump now sort of owns this global trade regimes he now says NAFTA is good because it's his NAFTA or it's as us MCA the U.S South Korea trade agreement didn't change that much but Trump has gone from railing against us talking about how good it is\nIt looks to me like he is selling those to his base that they weren't really committed anti free traders who wanted NAFTA necessarily ripped up\nAnd are super bothered by this is that sustainable though I mean some of the some of the reasons that he was able to to make hay out of trade agreements was that there have been real disruptions in the U.S labor market associated with certain aspects of foreign trade\nThese changes are not going to materially change those effects right well one key question we had throughout this you know during the campaign especially who always said I Want better deals because everyone negotiated the deal is we're we're idiots\nBut the suspicion was no you didn't win deals at all I just wanted to rip up and tear down the the current trade regime\nAnd this is not that it might be a better deal it might be a worst deal I'm but I'm all things considered as you point out it's just basically\nMarginal and I think in terms of the politics of this is very good for free trade for the reason you outlined here's here's the single most vociferous voice against every single\nTrade agreement the United states has had the less last fifty years\nSigning onto a new version of NAFTA and giving it to his seal of approval I think that will matter for a core of his supporters\nAnd helps the the free trade him\nAny something you said it's something I've been hearing for a lot of people which is that by rationing down these trade tensions within the north American area with South Korea ah with the ... you were the president stepped down from a brink of wanting to impose auto tariffs on that you\nDid that freak people up to work together on our shared grievances with China what does that mean in practice is there something that we're going to do now with Canada\nThat household China accountable in some way what is that gonna look like\n[noise] yes I think that um it's true that now that the president can declare victory on on the negotiating NAFTA even though there are skilled and very problematic provision like thing like their parents' plans on and on them and um um\nIn the office of the U.S trade representative will be able to\nUm work together with European Japanese Canadian counterparts on how to gather we can pressure the Chinese more effectively\nTo move forward on market access liberalization and tear down the barriers that they are standing by in in keeping their market closed and forcing American and Japanese and European companies to transfer technology\nAnd the price of entry to the market alone it's difficult for the United states and moved China on this but together with other like minded countries the China pursuing unfair trade practices\nI think there will be more of a more effective way to pressure the Chinese\nCan we talk about this big Bloomberg story in this context on Wednesday Bloomberg Businessweek published a bombshell article about tiny microchip sort of appeared on Chinese made mother boards which appear to be hacking devices that help the Chinese government compromise foreign government and\nCorporate servers the Bloomberg article allegedly devices were even found on servers an apple and Amazon\nThose companies have issued unusually categorical denial of a new story like this thing they'd never found these devices never talk with the FBI about finding them and they insist they are under no gag order that would prevent them from discussing such facts if they had found such devices\nAny what do you make of this story and if the if the Chinese really are doing this what is the significance both both economically and from a national security perspective I mean we have this super integrated supply chain we rely on enormous numbers of electronic devices to come out of China\nWhile it is um it's very helpful to the Trump Administration that the story broke this week the same week that vice president and and delivered a speech that was highly critical of a widespread array of Chinese practices including cyber espionage\nAnd so this really does lend credence to the Trump administration's viewpoint that global supply chains are a problem for American national security if there are these vulnerabilities and there's a Bloomberg report", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Left, Right, & Center", "city": "San Francisco",
