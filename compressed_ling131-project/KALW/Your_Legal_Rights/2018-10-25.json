California Lawyers Association\nGenome broken over is a principal at the firm of ... in his chair of the labor and employment practice group with more than Twenty years experience in both the public and private sector Gina has negotiated labor agreements with major unions and regularly represents government clients in various labor and employment proceedings\nLet me welcome each of you Tina Ellen de or legal rights and camp\nWell and again while we may be speaking about certain specific areas you may call with any question for our employment lawyers again the phone number to us here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling from\nOf the local dialing area please call us toll free an eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five and again Ellen Gina welcome I'd like to start here we've been talking about public employees\nDo work for private companies [noise] um [noise]\nShe was in the first ... issue or the first differences of public employees are protected by the state and federal constitutions in relation to their in their employment relationship with their employer\nAnd Gina can tell you what rights sure\nSo that comes with ah\nSome specific rights I'm particularly though are the ones that were most familiar about hearing of a First Amendment rights and it's funny because uh all of her social media people are fond of talking about their First Amendment rights well you only have a First Amendment right against your employer if you're a public employee [noise]\nUm there's also a property rights a that public employees have most public employees a that says that you cannot be deprived of your job without due process\nUm and then there's a number of other um [noise] other rights again coming from the the state and federal constitutions including privacy rights and\nSome others and for those that are listening that perhaps don't have a legal background or very strong background in civics\nThe constitution tends to be a contract\nBetween individuals' gotten their states and or the federal government doesn't necessarily apply to things going on between you and your neighbors\nThat's right ... the constitution constrains the government is a good way to think about it\nSo in this instance the primary difference of of the constitutional protections apply to the employment relationship which in the private sector they wouldn't\nRight and of course there are a whole host of other protections that private sector employees have but those are mostly by statute one exception is that the California Constitution does provide a right of privacy to employees in both the public and private sector\nUm but that is a that is unique\nAnd the privacy protections also differ in terms of of public employees\nFor instance their First Amendment rights are our shirt from scribe\nDid in the way that if they if they're talking about their job a broadly\nThe employer can you can control their speech in relation to their job duties ah\nThe the case that deals with that there's a Supreme Court case ... follows involved they a district attorney who revealed things about a search warrant\nPublicly and was disciplined and complained that he could not be discipline because he was protected by the first amendment\nAnd the Supreme Court said no no if you're speaking about your job duties your employer can control what you're saying even if it is a public entity a and the contrast is that Google case the guy who published a something about\nComplaining about women and the they weren't capable and\nAnd Google was going to fire him and there was a whole media onslaught about whether he could be fired and as a private employer Google can fire you for writing an email that they disagree with a\nMan and the public eye the private sector I'm Sorry you\nCan be generally filed fired for any reason or no reason to\nLet them as long as it's a it's not it's an illegal reason there are some protections there and it's interesting you mention the ah the James day more matter uh\nAnd just his termination 'cause he brought it to the national labor relations board\nA under one of the broadest protections for a private sector employees a which is the right to engage in concerted activity under the national labor relations act and in this particular case the national labor relations board\nFound that his speech was not protected by the act um which was [laughter] I think the right outcome and certainly helpful for employers who were trying to find the balance\nBetween protecting concerted activity and also protecting a the the the rights to their employees to not be discriminated against in the workplace\nSo in a moment I Would like to ask you a bit about what specific rights that gives the employee what specific rights if any that gives the employer I Do see that there's a call working its way through and one of these days we may see the name of the color so I can actually announced it um but obviously you're\nTalking about a different basket of rights for the employees and potentially some limits on the employers maybe some additional right some some limited instances as well and that's really where I'd like to go if that piece of paper ever makes it over here [noise] okay\nTo to ask this person not to take that sign to their clothes uh\nDid you say it was a call center so this is somebody who ...\nThumb bickering between employees and the large number of them for ...\nWell that that's a problem in the workplace and that does sound like it's something that and\nOften employers to sidestep issues like that\nOr rather than having a real shame can't have a shirt saying black lives matter or you can't have a ... a hat that says make America great again they'll just say you can't have clothing with words on it\nRight and that was there actually some police cases where they were wearing pins on that will tell I forget what the pins were and they were limited I imagine that law enforcement's a slightly different because it's a uniformed workforce\nBut a ... and ... you know the question would be is disruptive\nIt sounds like it's having it sounds like it's a workforce with trouble to begin with\nThank you thank you for joining us\n\nBefore we move on once again our call a lawyer lights night lawyers are standing by for your calls have you have questions for coal lawyer the number that will not place you on the air

A. L. W. Ninety One seven and available for your calls tomorrow\nIn bankruptcy law Leon ... certified specialist we'll take calls tomorrow Thursday October twenty fifth between nine and Noone at eight hundred

one hundred for either be sure to tell them you're calling from color Chris from San Francisco welcome to your legal rights\nThanks um I have a question I'm I'm curious whether your guest has any comments on the public employee pension cases that are currently pending before the Supreme Court\nWhich which cases are yeah I Know you have a specific question\nUm the my understanding is that there is there is a one main case that are pending and that a bunch of other one has been I've been um grants that un held a Hyundai not to um and that it's going to involve some sort of issue about um where the public employees right to a particular benefit or cruise\nYeah those disputes have been going on for some time and um [noise] um my my ... been involved in some about letting Haitians we've got a we've got some clients with interests at stake so it's probably better that I don't comment directly on ah on that litigation\nIn most cases and and the question as to what benefits accrue shine a lot of the cases that I handle involve people who were terminated while their applications for disability retirement don't are pending\nAnd ... and ...\nOnce the once they're no longer an employee\nThat you no longer have a right to a disability pension\nI'm so that ah [noise] I Know that\nThat is generally where the law is now or the other question is can they take away pensions a an ideal quite a bit with those cases too We're ... says like cancelling a disability pension awarded\nUh the the avenue in those cases is to go through the office of administrative hearings and have a hearing and a\nVery difficult to win and\nI'm On the\nThe public employee pension world is kind of an upheaval because they can't afford to maintain itself\nAnd pepper has made a huge difference I mean there's been an ongoing discussion about\nVested rights and ah it ah it remains to be seen where ah where that will\nUltimately wind up that's true well my my my remedy is just hire more employees\nWe need more public employees [laughter] All right thank you very much Chris thank you for joining us\nAnd I'm selling for a moment as another call makes its way\nPerhaps not [laughter] [noise]\nGabriella from San Francisco [noise] reasons one\nWas asking if there is more info on the Scalia case on that Shelly hearing process\nUm well it's really not a hearing it's an opportunity for the employee to say why he or she should not be terminated I have had scali hearings at which I've brought witnesses to testify some times useful\nAnd and and once the ... has decided that had there should be a written decision from which you can determine why the termination was upheld and then from there the employee has further appeal rights and\nAnd and just to back up a step ah for people that are not familiar with the process\nIs Kelly hearing is actually with usually be management of the government employers are not Ah yes yes and it's not until after the scaly hearing that either side can appeal to a neutral fact find or whether it's an arbitrator or the union or whoever might be under a collective bargaining\nRight or ... or whatever and and just for background or scaly the ... the name of it comes from scaly the stay personnel board which was in Nineteen Seventy five California Supreme Court case in which it was established that public employees do have a privacy interest\nOr in their employment so that's what we call it a scaly hearing because that was the case that established that right to begin with\nSo in essence a government employee would have a property right they have certain vested rights that don't exist at the public sector the public sector equivalent I'm Sorry the private sector equivalent would be when your boss calls you into his or her office\nFor you to try to make a case or their sledding papers across the country\nWell uh uh the the scaly process is meant to be a bit more substantive than that and of course when you're private sector employer does that um they're my may already be made up and uh they may you know what if they\n\nSure you're listening to your legal rights on K O W Ninety One point seven FM in San Francisco will be back right after this\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referral service can arrange for you to meet with an attorney experienced in the area of law related to your situation\nCall for one five Ninety eight nine one six one six or visit SF bar dot org for more information\nSo with that we've spoken about the fact that private employers are presumed to be will\nUnless the reason is a bad reason\nBetter there'd be no reason at all\nIn the public employees they have a property right therefore they have this Kelly hearing and those hearings that follow it before we go further let me call in with him from Belvedere welcome to your legal rights\n\nI Would like to know whether a sure that the guy the\nLawyers um know what goes on in other countries\nAre say the Scandinavian countries where there is not and in hearing contentiousness\nThat exists in our legal system and in our society as a whole a say in orange Germany oh where at least from what I hear a labor and management are not at each other's throat is is there a difference [noise]\nBroad picture protection the national labor relations board has um said that basically any communication um between or among employees about\nThe terms and conditions of their employment counts as protected concerted activity um and there's a common misconception out there that the national labor relations act only applies to unionized environments it doesn't it applies to all private sector employers\nSo if someone is trying to start a union campaign\nA that is that the the statements they make in favor of a union are protected by that act you want to talk about public\nHealth would do in terms of the public employees\nAnd it will be protected under the Myers militias brown act government code section thirty three hundred can you get a little closer to my sunshine government code section thirty three hundred protects\nPublic employees organizing and operating under the ... and the union context if their activities or to undertake and\n... and further and serve organized labor they have they are protected by the California government code and it's the public employee Relations Board\nThat ... that would adjudicate disputes are related to government code thirty three hundred Myers militia brown claims\nAnd once again I'd like to remind everyone that are color night lawyers are standing by if you have questions for color the number that will not place you on the air is eight hundred five to five nine nine one seven that eight hundred K. A. L. W. Ninety One seven\nYou will not be placed on the radio you still are standing by to answer your legal questions off here a long time supporters of color including in the areas of tax law real estate law Frank Adam from Pacifica in landlord tenant law Jessica ... from San Francisco\nPatent bluff aviation law lemon last arbitration\nRonald rodeo Palo Alto also\nAnd patent law specifically the preparation prosecuting the patterns and litigation\nRunner shelling senior counsel at current feral L O P in Menlo Park and also in landlord tenant from San Francisco south in bottom and again that number to call is eight hundred five to five nine nine one seven that eight hundred K. A. L. W. Ninety One seven\nMore over to take your calls tomorrow in bankruptcy law Leon bear certified specialist in Los Angeles will take calls tomorrow Thursday October twenty fifth between nine AM and Noone at eight hundred for seven seven three one one one\nIn workers' compensation law\nRobert Wyman certified specialist in San Francisco we'll also take your calls tomorrow Thursday October twenty fifth between nine and eleven in the morning\nHis numbers for one five three eight seven eight one zero zero and in either case be sure to tell them you're calling from your legal rights\n\nSo there's quite a bit of difference in the protection that the government employees have free speech from one source what the government can do in order to keep the trains running which is gives them some ability to somehow limit in some arenas would in ways they couldn't do\nWith private people that aren't engaged in trying\nWe talk briefly about the Fourth Amendment Jeff that would be a an area of your interest in the criminals a practice\nThat would be of great interest to me [laughter] of course we could probably go on for a couple of days if we're going to tackle the issue of privacy rights that\nThat's true well in terms of the Fourth Amendment I think it's important that people know that the employer I everything that set the workplaces basically belonging to the employer and that they can search or computer they can search your desk uh\nThe fact that a government employer is a government employer does not prevent them from going into an employee's computer or a desk\nIt might prevent them I was thinking about this in the way here it might prevent them from searching a private cell phones\nWell funny you should mention that [laughter] actually [laughter] it's still the case involving not not so long ago um well ... well the employer did the ... it was concluded that the employer did have that right um [noise]\nAnd ah in particular because of the circumstances and because uh the employees understood that um their their cell phones could be subject to search\nNow when we're talking about the Fourth Amendment Fourth Amendment is usually disgusted in the context of a criminal case in criminal law which is my area of expertise [laughter] and\nWhat might add some greed and some and actually support what you're saying is that even when we're talking a criminal case there are certain areas that are carved out where you don't have an expectation of privacy everybody knows you're subject to search when you go into the airport [noise]\nEveryone knows that will schools kids don't have an absence of constitutional rights their rights are somewhat diminished and balanced against the needs of the school so\nHanging a sign outside your apartment windows that the school can see it that says bomb hits for Jesus probably isn't protected speech according to the uh reasons in the U.S Supreme Court case um but the point being their carve outs from the area where we have an expectation of privacy\nWell that's exactly right and and you know Fourth Amendment ... analysis does apply in the area of government employment um and and it's it's cousin which does not stemmed from the federal constitution but but stems from this\nPatchwork of a statute and also the California Constitution which does cover private employees in California\nUm they all kind of come down to the same thing which is whether the employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy to begin with\nNow you mentioned Fourth Amendment rights and of course when you're talking about the Fourth Amendment you're generally talking about the United States Constitution but are there are some differences when we're talking about under the California Constitution\nYes some of the California Constitution provides for a ... general right of privacy of employees in personnel information that would generally be considered private one would have a reasonable expectation will be kept private so that means private employers as well as public employers\nA can't go Blagden about you know someone got fired for this or someone got accused of that or I demoted Jeff because he was you know goofed on the air I [laughter] I couldn't go telling people that if I were your employer\nThat isn't that correct but then that and then again those rights are shortcomings cry didn't\nAnd the cell phone case that you just discuss for the employer could search a private cell phone that was left in the offices that crap\nWill there are ... that the cases the cases turn on you know a a lot of it turns on the rules that the employer sets out at the outset so if you have a rule saying that um\nYou know your your backpack is going to be inspected on the way out so we can make sure that you're not stealing anything you've got advance notice of that ... that rule then you don't have any expectation of privacy you can't because you were told you don't\nSo a lot of it gets established at the beginning of the relationship ... and there's a question\nYes and before we get to that while we're still on this topic private sector employees have some other privacy rights do they not under various federal and state statutes\nOh absolutely I mean there are things that don't turn on whether there's a reasonable expectation of the most prominent of those as medical information ah so both state and federal law\nUh prohibit employers from asking for certain information ah and if they do have certain information they have to keep it secure they have to keep it locked a there is um\nThe prohibitions under under a the California family Rights Act and under fie huh I'm asking for somebody's diagnosis information or the treatment information employer can't ask for that\nUh there's also a federal\nStatute called Gina my personal favorite the genetic information Nondiscrimination Act\nOr that prohibits a employers from collecting are using certain types of genetic information\nUm there's also a state law that prohibits employers from asking for A People's says social media passwords and user name so there are some very specific prohibitions that protect employee privacy\nYou're listening to your legal rights on K O W FM Ninety One point seven in San Francisco I'm Jeff ... we're talking about selected issues of him in employment law in particular related to government employee put at my
