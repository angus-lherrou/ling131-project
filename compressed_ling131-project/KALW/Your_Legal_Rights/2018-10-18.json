seven in San Francisco\nThree months ago on July eleventh\nWhen discussing we begin discussing a series on the Supreme Court when we are to show what the topic\nA new nominee has been named to the next to me the next justice of the United States Supreme court what is the process but comes next and what difference does it make last week we continue the series with the political discussion new term new court\nOr with a new justice a program this week is the final in the series new term new cases a look at the cases on the upcoming Supreme Court docket we try to answer the questions just what's in the score card and what does all this mean for me now\nIf you have questions for my guest our phone number to us here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling from outside of the local dialing area we're outside of San Francisco please call us toll free and eight six six\nSeven nine eight eight to five five that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nMy guest tonight is Chris who of course is an attorney with the mosque what's a ... team in San Francisco who having served as president of the Stanford law review went on to serve as luck but to Ninth Circuit judge Kim wardlaw then served as clerked\nWithin the California Supreme Court for justice good when Lew Chris let me welcome your legal rights\nExtra and again if you have questions our number in the studio was far one five eight four one for one three four and again that's for one five eight four one for one three four or if you're calling from outside San Francisco please call us toll free\nAt eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nAgain that's eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five and I really like to start with this\nOf course you were listening last week and my guess last week commented that uh there's not much happening this year there's really not much of great impact do you agree\nYes I mean in in relative terms um last last term had quite a quite a number of blockbuster cases and looking at this year's docket at least so far um there's really nothing that jumps out as you know kind of case that would\nImmediately grabbed the attention of of all a person of course every case it to the Supreme Court is\nHugely important to the people involved into people who practice in that area of law and this year actually I think there are some really interesting cases that will have a big impact on our society but there you don't necessarily have the same kind of\nCases you last term when you had a challenge to Trump's travel ban and you had the metric ... piece of cake shop case um there's nothing like that so far on the terms docket\nOne of the things we discussed last week 'cause whether there are some high profile cases that suggest justice Kevin I should pay a pivotal world do you feel that as my gifted last week perhaps he wouldn't have a role this year different lead than perhaps Justice Kennedy ...\nYeah I actually really you know agree a hundred percent with them the comments that dean made a lot last week if you look at the cases the court has on top so far for this term\nIt's hard to really see any case where Kavanaugh will likely I'm vote differently than Kennedy in a way that would actually make a difference to the the outcome of the case um that said looking forward to perhaps the end of this term or or\nYears into the future certainly there are areas where we can expect that Kavanaugh will make a big difference but I'm In the immediate term you know it it's hard to see in any case where I'm cabinet was going to be the difference maker [noise]\nOne of the things that we talked about before going on the air was the courts public perception um what do you think is the ...\nWell I think ... as you know for a long time the Supreme Court has enjoyed much higher public approval ratings and high levels of public trust and um it's um sister branches of government I mean year after year um\nThe Supreme Court has much higher approval ratings than Congress or the presidency and um it's power derives you know from that legitimacy that it's had in the public eye for so long\nUm and so I think no matter what your personal views are about um what happened in the cabinet nomination um that that process was so controversial that uh [noise] get really threatened to affects the public perception of the court\nAnd we happened to have a chief justice chief justice Roberts who\nHas been very conscious and very savvy in um shaping and maintaining the courts public image so I expect that certainly this German and probably going to the future um he'll be using every tool at his disposal to kind of lower the temperature\nAvoid taking really controversial cases or decide potentially controversial cases and narrow ways in order to kind of\nRestore the that the courts public perception\nAnd ultimately to make sure the court doesn't suffer the kind of a hit in terms of respect and credibility that perhaps Senate didn't last few months\nAbsolutely I mean I'm you know a cynic might say that the Supreme Court is the only major federal institution left that that enjoys um popular support and and um I think will be it would be in in real trouble if if we lost that one as well\nSo in a moment I'd like to turn our attention to what I'd like to focus for most of the show tonight and that is specific cases really what's coming up what does it mean for us but I did want to ask you you mentioned about using tools to really protect the court and\nChat with you a little bit about what some of those tools are\n[noise] yeah so some people might know the U.S Supreme Court at um is a quarter of discretionary review so with a few very limited exceptions that are nice and really we're talking about of the court has complete control over what cases it decides to here\nAnd again when you say discretionary review that's the way and a nice way of saying that basically the Supreme Court's going to decide the cases that wants to decide you don't have any right to be heard by the Supreme Court it's really up to them what they hear\nExactly and so you know in order for a case to end up in the Supreme Court a lot of things have to happen you have to have proceeding in a trial court either federal or state that has to go to an intermediate appeals court that has to in the state system go to a state Supreme Court and then there has to be\nUm a what's called a cert petition a petition for a bit of ... out in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd that again says when you come and take a look at this that a cert petition\nExactly and um one thing that you often hear people say about the Supreme Court is you know it's not a quarter of error correction so it doesn't\nNot only do you don't have a right to be on the Supreme Court and really when you're trying to get a case into the Supreme Court it's not enough to say oh the lower court got it wrong it helps us a lower court got it wrong but\nIt really has to be some dispute among the lower courts generally um that that only the Supreme Court can step in and solve\nSo if a court in the ... circuit went in one direction and really believed in issue goes a certain way in a court in the eleventh circuits somewhere somewhere in the south besides the world looks differently they don't get up and see things the same way in the morning it might be the U.S Supreme Court's going to step in and say well boys settle down this is how we deal with it\nReally controversial social issues where you might expect the Ninth Circuit to go to a liberal direction and you know the eleventh circuit go a different direction but justice commonly you have circuits splits involving totally arcane non controversial issues where I'm\nReally there's not a liberal answer or a conservative answer there's just an ambiguous statute people read it differently and um you just kinda need someone to step in and say this is the correct interpretation\nWe're about to turn our attention to specific cases what these mean to you and really shift our focus tonight to why these things make a difference to you listening what cases are likely to affect how the world looks to you tomorrow morning because the Supreme Court decided today\nWe know some obvious ones such as ... versus Wade there's others that may be less obvious such as\nA look at the short run back and we'll talk about those things but again if you have specific questions from I guess this is your chance nuts and bolts from five thousand feet\nAgain our number here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three four again that's far one five eight four one for one three for if you're outside of San Francisco call us at eight six six seven Ninety eight\n[noise] so you know I listen to this argument as well and\nIt seems to me that I'm a majority of the court is inclined to to\nSo again you're listening to your legal rights on K. A. L. W.\nNinety One point seven FM in San Francisco\nMy guess tonight as Chris you attorney with the mosque what's a ... team in San Francisco\nOur phone number to us in the studio so you have questions for my gas is far one five eight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one bar one three four or five you're calling from outside the local calling area are toll free number\nIs eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and again that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nWhen we were talking I'd like to shift gears a little bit we've been talking about\nSome interesting a constitutional issues that um they may not look too important but they may have a big impact\nOne of the cases that uh you discussed with a Tim's versus Indiana what's all that about\nYes the tens versus Indiana is um like a lot of Supreme Court cases a case that brings together really strange bedfellows so um it's a it's a case of that's you know it exemplifies a pretty common fact pattern where um\n... you know someone who's involved in certain criminal activity and um the government decides they're going to do something called civil asset forfeiture where they ... they um see is uh the property of person who may have used that property in the commission of a crime and\nI'm definitely has become extremely controversial these days and so in this particular case you have the ACLU and libertarian groups and and then do a double ACP\n'em all lined up on the same side um to challenge a particular application of civil asset forfeiture you had a guy who um came into some money ... purchased a Land Rover and then he\nUsed a landlord revert to sell drugs um and even though this was actually a very low level drug crime that a carry the maximum fine of ten thousand dollars government decide they're going to see is is very expensive landrover\nAnd we could have a whole discussion we could have a whole episode on civil forfeiture in which as a defense attorney it has huge problem civil forfeiture where\nThe government does not necessarily giving your same due process right this is not a consequence of your conviction we're talking about whether they just simply take it away they take the money or out out of your pocket and say well proven SARS ... privy earned it the way we like will return to that in just a moment Holly from San Francisco you're on your legal rights welcome [noise]\nHi I just had a I just wanted a clarification on the case is talking about a four where\nI'm at that that um [noise] agencies couldn't we just given carte blanche to write all the regulations and who is bringing that case and and what are they are what are the other issues involved it wasn't clear to me but that's about\nOkay thank you Holly appreciate that and think what I think Ali was asking about the origins of the Chevron doctrine which is at play at some of these other cases\nWell Holly actually where you were used I'm asking you about the Chevron case or about the the second one I mentioned about um the sex offender registration law\n[noise] ah ... [laughter] I'm Sorry I didn't they maybe they blended together [laughter] is that a principal whereby that they you they can't just say do something and give the agency carte blanche to write all the rules and and so\nYeah I didn't I couldn't share all the details sure I may be an easier way to do this instead of\nSecond guessing ... question and flushing it up let's give a broad let's give a broader answer where we take a step back\nTalk first what Chevron is and then talk about the newer cases a bit maybe better explain it\nUm yeah so I think in in this particular case that that she's referring to um it's actually not shove on it it's it's a non delegation doctrine and\nI'm just doctrine which is the one I which I kind of in shorthand said as a no carte blanche I'm to the agency doctrine a\nThat is no no law has ever been struck down under that doctrine since Nineteen thirty five so people have not really taking it seriously um and so it was very surprising to me when it seemed like this particular challenge looked like it might succeed and\nThis is a case where um there was a federal law that I'm pertains to sex offender registration and um when the law was passed there were um a bunch of um people who had previously convicted of of of sex offenses and\nCongress didn't really want to figure out what to do with those people they basically told us attorney general you figure it out\nAnd uh the case was brought by one of these people who had been convicted of a sex offense prior to the passage of the law and what his what his challenge says is a well this law is unconstitutional because um you can't have a lot it's so broad that just tells an executive agency go figure it out\n\nSo ultimately the doctrine says you pay a lot of difference but there's gotta be limits\nYeah and so it's it's close to ... I Would say is closely related to to um to the shower on doctrine where in the short run this is the one where\nYou know if I'm if Congress writes a statute and then says the there's a particular agency charged with interpreting and applying that statute if the agency goes ahead and interprets the statute that that it has control over then\nI'm a court might can review that decision but it's really going to have a kind of hands off approach and get a lot of difference\nHighly I don't know if you're still on the line but I Hope that\nGave me some some direct and some some idea of where we were coming from if we\nLost people turning a little chocolate you left [laughter] and without Alan from Berkeley Welcome to your legal rights\nOh hi I just want to hear more about that for for for and uh [noise] you know and I'm In is and what what kind of a rough time that happened\nWith more and um [noise] you know how effective a few far and I'm\nGetting a fair [laughter]\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you can you turn your radio down just a moment we're getting a bit of feedback\nOn at all I don't have it on at all\nOkay that's coming from some other source seems to have stopped that I'm Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you and I can promise you if you knew my practice as a as a criminal defense attorney ... I was not going to let\nAsset forfeiture [laughter] go by the wayside that has to\nAll be patient I just know sometimes these programs and kind of get on tens of maybe organized than me so\nI Know I'm actually offering that no I Do it's my pleasure and I'm very pleased that you circles back to that point because I did want to talk about that yeah when you're with thank you thank you I'll I'll take it off the air okay thank you around civil forfeiture for those that don't know\nIs a punitive approach to pre judicial determination you have somebody who they\nSkate property they confiscate money it may be drugs it may be many other arenas but that's where we see it most often and at the same time that somebody is facing a criminal prosecution or looking down the road of the ... criminal prosecution that may be coming\nTo the police have taken their assets or the administrative agency has taken their assets and said well we're taking this until they prove otherwise\nYou have a limited time to step up and yet how can you prove otherwise you have this criminal case and you have to face the specter of making statements that will impact your criminal case while at the main at the same time as opposed to be protecting your assets and they use that money\nFor other purposes whether it's purchasing equipment or simply to turn to conduct\nSo that's the backdrop we're talking about forfeiture is a serious it poses serious questions about due process and whether people are really being treated fairly with that ... backdrop let's circle back to the Tim's case\nAnd you were starting to describe that in terms of forfeiture\nSure I'll Try not to get too arcane with this description but the the question that's presented in this particular case is whether the excessive fines claws are is incorporated against the states so what does what does that mean um there's a there's a clause of the U.S constitution that prohibits um excessive fun\nUm but\nIt has not yet been decided that that that individual right actually is applied against the state's which means it prohibits the states from doing something um\nWhen the constitution was um was drafted in an acted it was understood to apply to constrain or what the federal government was doing and it was only after the passage of the fourteenth amendment which talks about states not depriving people of\nEight eight to five five\nSo we don't see any real blockbusters coming up nobody is looking to throughout the exclusionary ruler suddenly outlawed the death penalty and another\nAnother substance that may be going away in tiny little cats um\nSo\nWhat do we think is the impact of the Roberts Court when it comes to real people if if we don't see any blockbuster cases is he going to make the kind of changes that perhaps a justice Warren did with the Warren Court [noise]\nI Would say he's been just as impactful if not more so and will continue to be um depending on depending on your perspective that that's a that's either cause for celebration or or cause for concern\nIn what way that we did we think he's going to have that kind of impact\nUm someone one area that interests me personally is the area of affirmative action and\nIt's an area where we've seen already incremental changes to make affirmative action more and more difficult um actually that just this week in Boston I'm a ... a Harvard um undergraduate admissions process is going on trial I mean a case where Asian American plaintiffs are\nChallenging the Harvard admissions process that among other things includes an affirmative action policy and to me that's the case that could wind up in the Supreme Court um in in um you know maybe two or three years and that could be the case it ends affirmative action\n\nIs is a case where you think that the change from Justice Kennedy to justice cabin on may shift the outcome\nYes I I think affirmative action is one of the key areas where you can really pinpoint a situation where Kennedy all do far from a liberal was\nWilling to um vote in favor of will specifically wanted to ... live action program the one at the University of Texas that were challenged and I'm a lawsuit that was heard actually multiple times by the Supreme Court in the last two years or he was a crucial fifth vote upheld the University of Texas policy\nUm it's likely or not inevitable that he would have upheld the Harvard policy but um I really can't see Kevin a voting to uphold that\n... that art from San Francisco welcome you're on your legal rights\nThank you um we're hearing a lot about um\nAllegations voter suppression in places like Georgia can you review what's been going on with cases on them running voting rights and what we can expect kind of just a court with a new addition to it\n\nThank you are and I I think what are asking is what there might be heading down the pipeline in the way of either voters depression or voter writes something that might have an effect on the impact\nYes so last term um the ... court had granted that a couple of cases that would have allowed it to 'em finally addressed this issue of partisan gerrymandering looking at um can ever be a situation where um\nGerrymandering not based on race but based on party affiliation everybody so extreme that it offends the constitution um court ended up not deciding that issue\nUm but I think that's one that might come back to this term there was a challenge to North Carolina's an electoral districts on on partisan gerrymandering ground where\nThe federal district court I'm struck it down went up to the Supreme Court and back\nUm and we may see it come back yet again to the Supreme Court in a way that um where they were they wind up addressing that issue\nArt thank you for joining\nI see another call working its way this way very slowly perhaps Robert waiting let's talk about some other areas where\nCases in the pipeline where the shift from Justice Kennedy to now justice Kevin I'm may make somewhat of a difference I'm One of the things we mentioned was the discrimination cases are there to such cases that are coming down the pipeline that might cause a paradigm shift\nYes so one that um there's one issue that really interests me right now is this issue of whether title seven which is the federal um in in uh employment discrimination statute of prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation I'm\nOf the law lets face prohibits racial discrimination and discrimination based on sex um but there's long been kind of divergent case law about whether because of sex includes discrimination against gay lesbian transgender employees\nAnd\nFor those books that don't work in this area of work the court\nMay look at the law may look at one particular question\nAnd in applying that law you see all kinds of different areas where it applies they may say you can't use this level of somebody talking somewhere else outside of court because it offends\nUs some legal principle and it's applied in a completely different way because by analogy it tells us that applies so is that really what you're talking about here the ... talks about or perhaps um or gender or racial disparity in there being applied to other ...\nYeah so that the statute talks um directly about a discrimination because of sex those it that's the language of the statute and so\nI I don't think anyone would would argue that you know at the time when Congress was passing the law they intended to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians but if you just look at the language of the law there are a lot of situations where anti gay discrimination looks a lot like\nDiscrimination because of sex and ... what the language of the statute says arguably that's illegal\nAfter must get us welcome you're on your legal rights\nThank you I I Am calling because\nI understand that they you were having a conversation about uh the lead paint case and the decision the court not to grant Cirque\nA and this is the case that is of great interest me and I'm Wondering whether you thought that the decision of the court and I'm Sorry because I didn't hear that conversation\nWeathering thought that the court a bird or whether or not I do believe that I it's inappropriate for a public entity to believe ... requiring remediation of a thing\nAs toxins by a private company [noise]\nBefore before I ask ... answer that question [noise] the way you framed it\nMay be a good illustrator of another point and that is you talked about a policy issue about whether an who should be required to pay for that um [noise] for for correctly and that and\nWhat I what I'm going to ask my guess is whether that decision per se is even been put before the court a lotta times when a case is brought before the courts even the U.S Supreme Court\nThey're not saying if laws ... is\nConstitutional not they're not addressing what the policy is they're addressing one specific question within that law\nAnd a and it may be a different question that comes up as to why it's constitutional or unconstitutional another way\nHelp flush anything out a little orbit just confused it so much the better\nOf thank you yeah so and I'm Sorry to disappoint you I I'm not actually not familiar with that particular case ah I Know that the court denied the cert petition earlier this week but I'm not actually familiar with 'em but within the petition and so I'm not really able to comment on\nWhether I think it was a good or bad decision but I Will say that building off of just point I'm just as when the Supreme Court decides to cure she is on the merits of it can decide the case based on one particular facet of of the facts or the law without reaching reaching the policy aspect of it\nOr that applies even more so at the search stage because the Supreme Court has almost complete control over what it hears and so when this do not denying a cert petition\nIt's really not passing on the merits of whether um\nIt's not even really saying whether the lower court um got it right or got it wrong it could simply does have decided um we just don't want to hear this case right now um we don't think it's interesting we don't think the issue was raised in the right way totally independent of whether they thought the lower court was correct on the merits\nAnd it may be that we need to do more work a little more argument in a couple of other cases before they take up the issue in order that they get it right yeah and thank you for joining us\nPam from San Mateo welcome to your legal rights\nThank you I don't know I had a question about how um Supreme Court decision that regarded\nI'm Native American and North Dakota and um the state law parent required a road address for somebody to register to vote and I guess a lot of the reservations don't have\nI'm rather stay in our rights Nance I'm and I'm Wondering\nI'm kinda wondering how that's fair I guess in the first place\nBut the second thing then as it seems that with this case and with some of the others they air that you described earlier that the trend I on the court seems to be", "show_name":
