a marriage or some other form of partnership from the beginning to the completion what exactly do you look forward to in a fairly large in my ... was due to matter both very law specialist certified by the California board of legal specialization space\nAnd VJ phantom of San jose Hi there good evening both of my guests are members of the family law section of the California Lawyers Association if you have questions for him I guess our phone number to us right here in the studio\nIs for one five eight four one\nFor one three for that's for one five eight four one for one three for\nIf you're calling from outside of the local dialing area that's outside San Francisco can be you've call us toll free at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five again that members eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nJanet BJ you've you've been most generous with your time participating on this show for several years as well as in our color nights let me welcome each of you to your legal rights and thank you Jeff it's good to be here again thanks Geoff happy Halloween\nAnd happy Halloween to everybody and I'd like to start with this so you're looking at getting a divorce exactly what do you have to expect is what's looking out there in front of your let's start with procedure give me a sense of what's out there who would like to start\nWell I guess I'll start and I think the the best thing is and I I think generally agree on this if you're even starting to consider splitting in a divorce you may want to go see an attorney before you actually separate and and get things prepared [noise]\nBecause once everything starts in the first thing to do on a divorce is filing some some petition and there's a lot of other documents that are required to be followed in California there's automatic restraining orders to go into place and everything has to stop so you may want to see a lawyer first to make sure that\nFirst of all you really want to get a divorce and then how are you going to proceed\nSo just to follow up on all of those forms that need to be filed um the the law in California requires it in order to get divorced you have to fully disclose\nAll of your assets all your debts all of your income all of your expenses and there are forms you can find on line\nTo guide us through what exactly that means but what I suggest that you do first if you're even thinking about maybe ending unfortunately your a partnership your marriage or your domestic partnership\nIs [noise] start gathering some documents get bank account statements\nAnd if you think that something is your separate property as opposed to community property\nYou're going to need to be able to prove it so you want to get documents right away as far back as you can so that you can what we call trace\nYour separate property I'm to something that came from your separate property yeah it's a legal issue but all you need to know is that banks only hold on to documents for so long\nAnd um [noise] so start getting that gathering that sooner rather than later because as time marches on those documents in the past will become harder and harder to get\nAnd that may be true whether it's the deed to the house or whether it's the gift card that came with your set of China or you'll want to be able to trace that but what I was wondering is\nI'm married my wife and I are going in different directions um but it's all amicable everything is friendly you think we still need to do think we still need to get that legal by day you're smiling you're laughing but that's not about that\nThat's because I've been doing this for about thirty two years and I don't know how many times and Janet's laughing to we have our clients come in and say we agree to\nAnd I wish it was um but sometimes it is and I think one of the things you have to look at is is again you dial it back a little bit and just to give an overview of the first thing that I tell all my clients when they first come to me and start discussing that I think I Want to split my marriage isn't working [noise]\nUm I think as attorney is the first thing we do is there any way to repair it and I have had reconciliation ths which are nice but then we have to talk about there's a couple of things you know in California it's a no fault state so that means if one ... one party wants a divorce you're going to get it\nAnd you may want a legal separation and there's a difference between legal separation divorce but also you may come in and asked for a legal separation if the other party comes forward says no I Want a divorce or getting a divorce the other thing that you have to keep in mind that's really important is we're a community property state\nAnd what does that mean that means that any property acquired from the date of your marriage until the date of your separation is presumed to be community and has to be distributed equally\nThe exceptions to that is going to be an inheritance kept separate or give to one particular spouses comes up or and so when we started talking to people about the ramifications you want to get a divorce for you want to get a legal separation where you want to terminate your domestic partnership\nOkay let's look at how this was all going to fit in and then go from there\nI Would say it's a lot easier to get married than it is to get divorced\nUm you go down and you get your license you get married and um I I Can't speak from personal experience it took me Thirteen Years before finally I I was able to get married to my partner but um\nBut I Will say it's much harder to get divorced and um even if it's amicable and even if you have\nActually agreed on everything and they're genuinely is no dispute about anything at all getting the forms filled out correctly so that the court clerk and gives you that stamp saying yes you've succeeded in ending your marriage\nCan be complicated and I've had attorneys who don't practice family law\nWho got a were doing their own divorce and and a friend of mine and said you know my my divorce paperwork has been rejected three times can you help and I looked at it and thought well here's why and and and was able to help so it is possible and many people do it themselves but\nUm it can be in the end much more cost effective to have an attorney help you\nAt least get your paperwork right um I Would also say one thing you should consider is whether you want to um what do you do have anything to fight about\nAnd whether those things that you're fighting about can be resolved in which case you might want to meet with a mediator and there are a lot of family law attorneys who did mediation\nUm and there's also some mediators who aren't attorneys who can help you uh\nI Would recommend that you if you do use a mediator you make sure they know about family law but there are a lot of people out there doing mediation\nSo and then I Do mediation what I Would say is\nUm I prefer if you're going to mediate the actual issues especially financial and property you should seek it through an attorney that's a mediator if you're talking about custody and visitation issues there's a lot of mental health professionals out there that will help mediate that aspect of it\nBut um even if you come to an agreement on everything as Janet was saying to do a proper marital settlement agreement and then to get all the proper documents together even to get it through to disillusioned\nCan be a little bit daunting 'em and\nOr they may have gone and gone to a legal document prepare a good example is I I had a client come to me years after they had the divorce\nThey had a marital settlement agreement and and it was like three or four years later and she said well we still haven't distributed our property and I look at the marital settlement agreement and all it says is we agree to split everything equal [laughter] that was the agreement and that was the judgment for\nYou use the phrase a little while ago distinguishing between a legal separation at a divorce can you tell us a little bit about the difference between a legal separation in divorce\nWell sure ah the legal separation means that everything except for your marital status will be a divided by a court or by your agreement so you'll have a judgment dividing all of your property it can address support it can address custody it can address\nUh everything except for the marital status so\nSome people may be for religious reasons don't want to actually be divorced and want to stay married and or maybe the only other reason that I Know of\nThat people sometimes seek legal separation is for health insurance coverage because people can continue to be covered as a spouse or you know the laws changing on that but that's been a traditional reason that the uh\nIs a child with the mother is a child with the father is a child with another parent who where does the child spent time and that's really what physical capacity is so when you're talking about disputes over custody I generally think that that's disputes over um decisions about health education and welfare and if your\nTalking about the time share where does the child spend their time and um both of those in ... in both cases California\nReally is always trying to keep the best what's in the best interest of the child at the forefront\nAnd often you know you have parents who come in and say well here's here's what works for me in and here's my work schedule you know and so I Want to see a little Johnny on on these days so that I can have date night on Thursday and be able to go to I Love going to the movies every other weekend with my friend Sally so\nYeah and that's not about the parrot right and if the child gets lost in the equation then I think you might be missing the point so when you're\nGoing when you're thinking about ending your marriage or any relationship and you know try and think about what's going to be best for a little Johnny look what's going to be best for the children\nSo what steps of the court go through to figure out what's in little Johnny's best interest do they just simply a hospital Johnny maybe you've done he's not so little but it can get into bed and so the\nCourt has a lot of um steps in place to try that because the the ideal situation as the parents make the decision for the children they will always prefer that the parents make all of those decisions\nBut in the state of California what's really important is before the court can even make any orders regarding long term custody plans or visitation orders that the parties have to go through mediation\nAnd then we get split up by counties because every county then deals with mediation different some counties are what we call confidential non recommending in some counties are um non confidential and recommending\nSo that means that before the court will make any decision at a decision at all you have to meet with we have to meet with a mediator so if you haven't already engaged in private mediation about your child you're going to be talking to someone\nSomewhere before you can make the court get a court decision and what I um when I find is is a problem frequently and in the custody issues\nIs that people are really thinking about really thinking about financial issues and they're not thinking about the child they're thinking about well if I have this child more than\n... percent of the time then I'm going to get more than ... dollars from my soon to be ex spouse or the other parent and child support or spouse will support\nSo um [noise] I Would say that that's a a a suspect\nMotivation for wanting to spend time with your child\nAnd according to the court is is a little bit uh cognizant of that the other problem that I'm seeing especially in the bay area because of the cost of living here wants to parties have split up and especially if one particular spouse either was non working\nOr was much lower income than the other\nTo try and remain with the children here in the bay area is harder and harder as a result I don't know about your job I'm seeing more and more where they're asking for what we called move away is um that they need to one of the parents wants to move out of the area out of the state and take the child with them\n[noise] [noise] ... Howard from San jose you're on the air welcome to your legal rights\nI was talking about which would be that aren't\nAren't that joy and when would that very often the lady that ran for the child\nI I think it's very rare but um I act as minors council and a lot of cases where where there's a high conflict the parents can't agree the court will appointed attorney just represent the child's interest and there are times where miners council may come in and actually file a petition\nTo have the child I'm dean it puts it puts them in dependency court in deems them a ward of the court or we join a and I've done this before we joined another party could be a grandparent aunt or uncle and plays the child in their custody it may be temporary it may end up be permanent\nThat that some unfortunate when that happens because up until the time that the party separated the child was living with these two parents but if that time that the child was spending with both parents was really not in that child's best interest anyway then\nIt it can be a good solution for the child and there'll be there'll be sent a dependency court and put in foster care usually though is what I've seen often happened with a grandparent or an uncle Arnett they try and\nPlace with a relative first if they can't place but there is a code section in the California family code that says that before the court can place a child and the custody of a non parent they have to find that it's detrimental for the child to be with other parents first\nI think it's ever been in a situation where the ... or so that like that or they get [noise]\nI'm sure a lot [laughter]\nThe children all the old adage staying together for the kids is I I get that from a lot of clients and the one thing that I tell my clients that because I'm a parent\nSo you describe how your marriage is is is the kind of marriage you want for your kid when they grow up because that's what they're going to model so a lot of times\nThe children know exactly what's going on in a marriage and if you don't want them modeling and finding a partner that is going to mimic what your marriage is I mean that's that's what's gonna happen\nWhen when children see unhappy parents all of the time it it affects their quality of life and if they are are happier separated then I'm I'm always sad when people come and say well I stayed together you know for for our for our children and\nAnd then I have to say do you do you think that that's been better for them and often thinking about it differently they have to say well maybe maybe not\nThank you very much guy how are you like to be joining us in our did\nBring up an interesting point and that is it sounds as though the\nFamily law in the family courts are very parallel to the dependency courts so you want to try to keep the children with their parents or reconcile the children's ... one of the other parents and when that doesn't work you start looking to relatives when that doesn't work you start looking at non related extended family members\nAnd putting a child in foster care as independent records you have to be the last\nThe last option that the last thing people want to do\nIt it is in and you really want to keep the child if if possible out of the dependency court dependency court actually has ... their orders are superior to family court if the case ends up independence he the family court proceedings or state\nAnd you have to wait until the dependency court does what they're going to do that is why would I Try and do if I see something like that happening in a case the first thing I Do is try and get a relative to join to the family law case\nAnd see if we can do it that way the only advantage in bringing it to a dependency court depends on the different parents is there some services that can be offered 'em through social services to the parents\nLike a reunification type of program and these services that could be a plus but the problem is once you're stuck in the dependency priests process can be a very long time and it is a taint on on the parents are and it follows them for a long time\nFor the goal is for the children to be with the parents unless it's it to the child detriment so to meet that goal a lot of efforts will\nBe made to reunify the children with the parents if if they have had been ... had to\nBe separated because it was to their detriment to stay with\nEither parents and then um I I have seen a lot of\nReunification hearings and proceedings happened and it's a slow grind and like you say they get stuck in that system for a long time and\nYou're listening to your legal rights on K O W Ninety One point seven in San Francisco will be back right after this\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referrals service can arrange for you to meet with an attorney experienced in the area of law related to your situation\nGo for one five nine eight nine one six one six or visit S. F. bar dot or for more information\nOn jet paid them and you're listening to your legal rights we've been discussing ... one on one what do you have to look forward to it affirmative action I guess the studio tonight are both very law specialist certified by the California board of legal specialization\nState bar of California Janet Franco with offices in San Francisco and B. J. faith based them with offices in San jose\nWell you're married Bianca I'm okay wherever you got married you're you got married and uh you are married and California will honor or a marriage that was properly done in another country I think they're\nI I Can't think of what might be an exception to that but I can imagine that there may be some exception to that depending on if if the marriage wasn't properly done in that other country but if you followed some other countries procedures in our properly married there then you're married here\nThat's generally are that's generally the law I mean I Can't the only thing I can think of is if there's some of the small Middle Eastern countries where they don't even register and the um the marriage there's no registration where it's just the uh the husbands says okay you're married to me now and I there are a couple of those countries\nThe only time but other than that ... California in the United states is going to acknowledge that marriage\nDo I have to register my marriage or an automatically should be considered as I said I married you know you know\nThe charm addict you're married but the problem we may run into from the international standpoint is if you're going to follow for your divorce\nAnd if you file here in California and you get your divorce decree depending upon the other country\nThey may not recognize the California divorce decree\nI'm a perfect example is in I I Do a lot of cases with India and because India doesn't acknowledge no fault divorce you have to have a fault if you get a no fault divorce and California is not recognized in India and you're still married in their eyes\nAnd so you have to go to India and get a decree as well and there's a couple of other countries that way because they won't acknowledge the no fault\nYou\nYou're welcome back thank you for joining us\nWe have another call but it's on its way and but as it's working its way here it's time to\nShift the shift from talking about custody issues to talking about financial issues and of course when we're talking about financial issues too big ones are child support and spousal sport\nSo let's start with cells would support how was ... it depends\nOn which spousal support so there's two kinds of spousal support in ... in the state of California\nThere's will be called temporary spouse will support and that's exactly what it says temporary pending the disillusion to try and maintain some kind of status quo\nAnd almost every court will pretty much established the amount just temporary spouse will support the way they do is child support and it's just based on guidelines the input of the two gross income and so forth and we use a software program [noise]\nThen we have what we that's only because attorneys don't really like to do math exactly we we we could do it if we wanted to but we would have to do algebra and everything else [noise]\nThen you have permanent support and that is only available to marriages of ten years or more where there's a long term marriage for permanent or long term support and then you can't\nRely upon this'll master or that type of guideline a calculation and you have to follow these various factors under family could section forty three twenty\nI think of it this way um the temporary support is the support between when you've separated and you need some support until the time that the um judgment is find on the property is divided and permanent support is support this ordered after that so even in a short term marriage you can have permanent supportive\nDisordered um and the interesting thing about temporary and permanent support is that although both of those words refer to time it has nothing to do with time it's just they're just legal words\nThat were attached to spouse will support to confuse people aren't lawyers [laughter] that's true because there is technically we don't follow permanent spousal support because under California law\nThe intent is there and it's a statute parties that are getting divorced or to become financially independent of each other within a reasonable time that reasonable time his presumed to be no more than half the lengths to marriage but that's not a bright line\nJeremy from San Francisco you are with us on the air that come to your legal rights [noise]\nHi I'm I have an odd situation uh Fifteen Years ago I was married for a week well legally a month [laughter] and um we did it on a whim when you're intoxicated anyway um\nSo uh we got a I heard deal with all the ... and everything and she got an an all men I started getting she lived in another state I started getting papers via FedEx it was all taken care of and that was that a few years later I met my ex wife\nAnd we were may are together and married a married a total of just shy of five years uh we got to California summary disillusioned or no hassles or anything they present the whole time\nAnd um and then I I remarried I married now and I come to find out you know the federal government that my first divorce is invalid because it was done on a tribal court in Nevada\nAnd they apparently had no jurisdiction and looking online they did this to a lot of people they decided to start granting just solutions\nTo non tribal members and non try residents non reservation residents and uh they were allowed to so subsequently long I've I've since just recently just a few weeks ago a pain to\nDivorce a second divorced from that first wife and I am going to uh immigration proceedings with my life if you will um but my second wife or is it I have no idea where you know we don't talk anymore and and\nThis is the second one is the summary dissolution wife\nDirect okay correct so so the federal government said that my marriage to my current wife wasn't valid so we just got remarried the other day just just as a city all over and Oakland and a good um\nAnd and we didn't we didn't bother getting a divorce um 'cause the people at the state level that we didn't have to 'cause I'm remarrying the same person\nThe federal government hasn't told us anything and they won't basically ah I tried that they won't but my second wife\nI don't I don't know what the deal I mean we filed taxes you know for five years I'm married uh jointly and I don't know is is that going to come back and fight nice hadn't come back and bite me you know\nHow many em says Jeremy you know how many years ago did you get that summary dissolution\nI got it in two thousand eleven so\nYou know you're you're just a little bit outside of my expertise as a family lawyer went but I I think you should be okay as far as the taxes go well yeah it\n... your second your second summary disillusion you would have been deemed a punitive spouse anyway at this point because you thought you had an an omen so that summary disillusion is\nUm and I heard about what I I I've actually heard about some of these ... and the divorces that they were doing\nAnd uh some of them we actually got\nWhere we called it none pro tonk where we had back dated the judgment because it was by air and it should have been entered on a on a particular earlier date we were able to get that but in your particular case you're fine now um you got your divorced from the first\nThe second would have been deemed to Putin spouse and you have your judgment a disillusion so you're good and he remarried your wife so climbing graduations where\nDo you get another I think you get are entitled to another honeymoon\n[laughter]\nUm we're still living our we've always been a three year were ... honeymoon phase will I'm but I'm not wrong\nWe went to a judge where we got a lawyer and went to a judge and ask for non pros honk yeah on the tribal divorce because it would it would facilitate our immigration stuff yeah um but they denied it yeah it depends on the judge or you're just 'cause they said they weren't allowed to do it\nYeah ends on the judge to yeah it's at the discretion of the court saying we're not allowed to do it is sometimes code for we're not going to do it\nGot it I don't know where did you get it done I mean where did you wherever you are granted I ... I Want to go there [laughter]\nIt it it's not always just the county and happens to be the judge said sitting at the time to so and I ... all over California so but it's a couple of ... counties you've\nDone everything that you needed to do I think to protect yourself now so\nThey don't pro drug thing would have my immigration stuff because it's ... it's basically they're they're ah they're saying that we have to file apply all over again because the divorces dated prior to divorce was a host\nMind marrying my current wife now proton hell I mean you know we're doing it you know but if\nI could I could say well I don't know actually the government so they don't um [noise] so I just thought maybe if I could try again for the number of heart but if you think it's just the judge and thank you for your time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Legal Rights", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
