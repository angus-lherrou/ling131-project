{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "You're listening to your legal rights on AOL W. F. M. [noise] Ninety One point seven in San Francisco I'm Jeff Hayden [noise]\nThree months ago on July eleventh ear to show what the topic a nominee has been named to be the next justice to the United States Supreme\nCourt [noise]\nWhat is the process that comes next and what difference does it make\nTonight we move on to part to\nHave you have questions from my guest or ... us right here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for that for one five ... for one for one three for your calling out settled local dialing area that's outside\nOur toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nMy guest tonight is dean Johnson dean is an Emmy nominated commentator on both legal and political matters as well as a practicing attorney and our program this week we'll continue this discussion new term new court\nThe United States Supreme court begins and new court year with a new justice ... Johnson let me welcome you back to your legal rights so thanks just glad to be here and again our phone number to us if you want a Dell direct in the studio for one five eight four one for one three four\nOr if you're calling from outside of San Francisco are toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nAgain that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and I'd like to start here\nDean at the start of this process some months back seems to me it made some pretty bold predictions about the nomination process and here we are how do you ...\n[noise] well we fared extremely well um if you go back to the transcripts of that program you'll recall than I predicted Kavanaugh's confirmation a by a vote of fifty to forty nine\nOr the actual vote was fifty to forty eight with Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voting president she later announced that uh had she not voted present but rather voted on\nConfirmation itself she would have voted no so that would have made the vote fifty to forty nine which is precisely um what I predict\nOr more importantly more significantly\nWe talked a lot in in in the last show in part one about the paradox that some of the senators faced in that\nAre particularly for Democratic senators in red states facing close elections that if they wanted they they had a choice they on a trade off if they wanted to preserve\nUm the chances of the dumber of Democrats taking over the Senate again and taking and we're taking over the house um that even though their consciences might tell them otherwise the rational move the strategic move would have been to vote yes on Kavanaugh\nUm those senators the Dems and in red states are facing toss up all actions didn't do so and exactly as as my model predicted um that has I I I won't say a cost this the Democrats the Senate but it is made the Senate\nA very very long shot and now I'm the changes in the voting polls and those senators states I'm a McCaskill I'm In Missouri Donnelly in Indiana and especially Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota the changes\nIn the postures of their elections um has been one of the reasons that the chances of the Democrats taking the Senate and now has dropped from about two two and seven to two and nine which is exactly what I Would predict a based on the numbers I was looking at\n'em if you'd asked me pre Kavanaugh what the chances were of Democrats taking over the entire Congress House and Senate\nI Would have answered about twenty four percent tonight the answer would be about Seventeen percent\nYou know I I\nLike to ask you about a whole bunch of different arenas individual in Tennessee where you what your thoughts are and where this goes through um\nLitigation from amid a one of the big questions that people up and asking leading into the leading into the vote on justice cabinet is roe versus Wade and this means what are your thoughts on roe Israel in danger\n[noise] I don't think roe itself is in danger but the the word you always hear 'em is chipping away and that sort of a vague non legal term ... being more specific\nUm the battleground on roe versus Wade and reproductive rights right now is is what\nLawyers referred to as an undue burden on cases come before the court where there has been some restriction uh placed a not not a bar on abortion butter restriction that makes abortion more difficult for example\nIf a state were to pull funding from any hospital that provided abortions that would be a burden on the right of abortion\n[noise] and\nThe questions before the court now are these undue burden questions when is a burden reasonable and when is it not\nI'm In the past um the justices have been willing to consider these undue burden questions and in many cases strike down of various legislative actions that put a burden on a woman's right to choose um\nThere's a real question about whether a judge a now justice Kavanaugh will do that I'm In the past um he has he has talked to in dissenting opinions\nAbout what we call religious freedom which sounds like a very good thing um but it does impact or things like reproductive rights and to which well we'll talk about later gay rights I'm because I'm\n... religious freedom says that there should be accommodations for faith based claims even where those claims contradict a general public policy so for example justice Kavanaugh has said um that a Catholic hospital run by priests\nCan still receive federal funding even though it refuses to provide contraception or abortion saying this is simply a an accommodation to the priests and the Catholic institutions a religious freedom and how far that goes is a real question and it's one of the air is one of the few are as I think\nWe're a Kavanaugh will make a real difference\nA that being said there are no I'm roe versus Wade type cases on the horizon a justice cabin on the rest of the court will not hear any of those cases\nThis term probably not next term what will happen maybe two years or more down the road is we'll see state legislatures enacting\nA various types of measures that will place burdens on a woman's right to choose and those cases eventually making their way up to the\nUh to the Supreme Court and at that point I think we're going to see\n'em just how far a Kavanaugh's concepts of religious freedom extend and how much\nUm he believes that as he told the Senate to the roe versus Wade is is a precedent that has been um sustained by the court many many times and therefore are entitled to a great way to under the doctrinal story decisis or precedent\nWhich for\nFolks that are listening in the ... outside the stadium that are non layers when we talk about starting to sites as we talk about the idea of the older case should control what comes after it so that the law is steady and dependable and we don't make bad decisions because we're relying on\nYeah exactly as Alan Dershowitz once said law is the only proposition is the only professional um where you're actually rewarded for showing that lots and lots and lots of people before you have thought of the same idea\nAnd if courts have said the same thing over and over and over again\nFor many years the chances are if you say the same thing again you're going to win and the more the idea is the more a case of sight and the for the the longer the period of time that a case of sided um the more it becomes set in concrete as part of\nUm the court's jurisprudence and of course roe versus Wade has been cited time and time and time again and more importantly it's become embedded in our culture in our politics um this is a harsh way to phrase it but people take reproductive rights for granted we assume\nThat women are going to have those rights and to change that to uh to go back and restrict those rights or take them away by judicial fear it would be something that would cause and obviously a great deal of strife\nUm in our society would take us back to an era that none of us want to remember and the courts look at that a justice Kavanaugh said you know political considerations don't enter into my decisions but trust me that they do I mean it's the Supreme Court\nOn correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't it just a few years ago we had the same conversation on the airwaves when a Justice O'Connor retired short list by conservative and it it has that been pretty much the rolling doctrine\nGorsuch was confirmed um\nBut what I thought I might do is go over some of the more significant cases that had been decided um post Gorsuch confirmation and before Justice Kennedy\nI'm retired in other words when the court was fully staffed with all nine justices ah we we can look at those decisions\nUm and we can say to ourselves what would have happened given the spread and given 'em how the court came out what would have happened if we took out Justice Kennedy and we put injustice Kavanaugh and the answer is um it's pretty clear that it would have made\nLittle or no difference in fact in those Fifteen cases it would have made no difference whatsoever [noise] um so for those those listeners who um\nDidn't care for justice Kavanaugh who thought he was a bad appointment or the message would be don't panic for those of you who thought justice Kavanaugh was the greatest thing since sliced bread and was a brilliant appointment\nDon't pop the champagne corks just yet\nUm that the Supreme Court as an institution works very slowly it works generally incrementally um it's a passive institution in that it can only decide the cases that come before it and that it wants that that it chooses to decide um\nAnd we typically you know we remember Justice Kennedy fondly I think because of\nOf over ... um which we discuss generally the same sex marriage case we were we remember Kennedy as something of a liberal as the swing vote who was sometimes on the liberal side but that's not really accurate a Justice Kennedy was quite a conservative\nHe like a justice Kavanaugh is very pro business um he had questions about reproductive rights I'm questions about immigration rights I'm so the the Kavanaugh court if that's the proper term is not going to be a whole lot different\nFrom the Kennedy court um there are few areas where they may be different uh one area we've talked about it we touched on a little bit already the area of religious freedom which I think may become a\nSignificant but to expect sudden changes or to expect that the right of privacy is going to disappear or that defendants rights I'm as articulated by the Warren Court are going to disappear or a B significantly taken away all of\nA sudden I'm it that's just not going to happen the other thing to think about is that um and I've had interns who became Supreme Court clerks and I know that um [noise] when you become a Supreme Court\nClerk regardless of your radiology going and you learn a lot about how the court functions and how you should function within the court from your justice justices are very very much men tours of uh of their clerks and justice Kavanaugh clerked as to justice Gorsuch\nFor um Justice Kennedy so I suspect his approach is going to be very much like Kennedy's and I think the court is going to [noise] to stay the same with certain exceptions that we can talk about\nThe last time we were here and I see it calls on its way too much but the last time that we're here we're discussing whether the court was truly stepped in to the right and who if anybody is left as a swing vote\nUs about that theory on that if you like to refresh us\nYou're as the as the median voter theory which says essentially the guy in the middle almost always gets his way if if you have [noise] if you have nine people\nVoting on a proposition for swing one way and for swing the other the guy who takes the middle position um is the deciding vote\nIn the Kennedy era Kennedy was traditionally the deciding vote 'em now um if you look at the histories of the various justices Justice Roberts now becomes the median voter the center guys so\nIn a very real sense I'm this becomes the Roberts Court are typically I'm you referred to a court uh as you know by its chief justice so the rent when Rehnquist was chief justice it was the ... court Earl Warren had the Warren Court\nThis has always been the Roberts Court because he's chief justice but now in a very pragmatic way it is Justice Roberts' court because\nHe holds the swing vote 'em that swing vote is somewhat to the right of Justice Kennedy so in a sense the whole court shows to the right\nBut his chief justice not only holds the power of the swing vote but he holds the powers of chief justice um the ability to decide whether he is going to write the majority opinion or he'll sign it out to somebody else\nWhich dictates how broad the decision is going to be whatever whether the reach certain issues and so on\nAnd of course that presumes that he's on the majority because they'd be on the minority that would follow the senior most justice absolutely um let me interrupt you just that we have a call coming in Nancy from Berkeley what your legal rights hey Nancy\nNancy are you still with that\nI had an editor here on the air welcome to your legal rights\nThank you um I wanted to ask your guest um he said that um because at least ... [laughter] that\nI'm that I'm\nKind of like Heidi Heitkamp Claire McCaskill\nUm voted for um Kavanaugh that um they're going to leave the Senate fate\n[noise] um but what makes him think that they were going to win the election anyway [noise]\nI mean you know I ... and Democrats and Democrats are going to vote for them no matter what so I don't understand that if they voted for Kavanaugh all of a sudden they're going to accumulate all the votes [noise]\nNo actually what I said was that because they voted against Kavanaugh a man that yeah yeah they vote they voted against Kavanaugh right on it you know it's funny if you are listening I was talking about what we call the median voters here I'm the same idea applies to senatorial elections\nAnd when you have a democratic candidate with a largely Republican constituency as you do in those cases\nUm and the election of at least historically is very very close\nOf the way those candidates act on a high profile very salient very controversial issues like the appointment of of justice Kavanaugh\nOr or the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh can really a shift the election one way or the other if you're an incumbent with a solid see that's not going to make a lot of difference but if you're election as a toss up as were those three elections than your decision on on one issue like this can shift it from a toss up\nTo um to a problem a possible or even the probable loss and in fact that's what's happening\nVote a occurred but I don't understand\nI mean I I don't understand if they had voted for Kavanaugh wow I think all these other countries and going to vote for them I don't I don't think you know and the Democrats and if they had voted for him I think they would have lost a lot of Democrats votes\nNo actually not the Democrats Democrats who are going to vote for them would vote for them anyway um but you would pick up a number of votes as you move towards the center of Bill Clinton was actually a master of the strategy when he was seeking\nThe presidential nomination he was way out to the left but as soon as he got the nomination he moves towards the center to seize upon those are some of those voters at the center and and to the right of where he was previously\nUm and it's just the the the math works out beautifully and sometimes I like I Would rather do this on TV because I can show you exactly how it works but um I mean the facts speak for themselves um the the the probability of Democrats taking the Senate\nUm have dropped from about two two and seven to two and nine which about twenty two ...\nGel Manson because he voted for Kavanaugh is going to win his seat\nUm he was he was rated as a probable when any way his his election was was rated as leaning democratic but he certainly enhanced his chances now\nYeah I don't know if I Am glad I don't know if I Would have voted for anybody who voted for Kavanaugh\nSassy Nancy I'm I'm gonna ask you to hold that thought we need to stop for a break for just now that you're walking down the line won't be gone for more than a few seconds Pam I Know you're on the line please stay with us in a month for just a moment you're listening to your legal rights on K. O. W. F. M. and we'll be back right after this\nThat come up that are coming up before the court one involving um have a florist who refused to serve\nA same sex couple and and some others um that may bubble up and may give us an indication and this is an area where I think justice Kavanaugh's vote may make a difference and he may very well find\n'em companions to follow along with them on on the right side of the Supreme Court patch was that way more information than you wanted about that\nActually it's not so let me give you a couple of hypothetical and let me let me play play with a little bit\nOkay how do you play judge and give me hypothetical 's\nOkay you're on Mormon and say you drink alcohol it okay for it at work in a bar and is there a chance to alcohol even though you're a cocktail waitress\n[laughter] okay yeah I mean I\nI go there and and for a little more serious still kinda\nUh-huh if you're up there and say yeah sorry hanging down face yeah is it okay if you work in a barbecue place and you're not going to serve the ...\nWell that you know that's the question and I think you know your hypothetical indicate that the problem with this concept of religious freedom it's\nIt's so ... that it it can include anything if you could claim that you that you're the churches fast drivers and so ... your religion dictates that you drive more than a hundred miles an hour or you therefore exempt\nFrom the speed limits I mean you can multiply absurd examples um as Justice Scalia used to say until the cows come home um I think it's very problematic area [noise]\nUm and I think it would be extremely difficult to develop a coherent ... jurors prudence based on this notion of religious freedom I mean it was originally as one of those cases are one of those cases of unintended consequences of legislation\nThe original purpose was very Salvatore was to protect the sacred burial grounds of Native Americans in their religious rights but it has it has expanded into something far beyond what the original legislature like legislators intended and may go even further\nOkay that fully intended it mushrooms [laughter]\nIt it certainly has exploded in and we're just waiting to see if it explodes and and you know washes over a lot of a jurisprudence I mean the concern here is obviously\nThat the notion of religious freedom um interfaces with notions like reproductive rights I'm justice Kavanaugh\nUh for example has said and I think I mentioned the study Catholic hospital can based on claims of religious freedom can refuse to provide contraception in abortions and still obtain federal funding um so you know how far does that go\nYeah that's a good question thank you very much I'm not really good discussion the other hand I thank you for joining us thanks Jeff thank you Bye bye\nDavid from Berkeley Jonathan from Oakland you're on the air bear with me just a moment I Do have one listener question that was called into us rather than coming on the air but this this ... thing\nAn injustice Kavanaugh what's his opening remarks and that's part of an angry he was in the corner of going back to the second portion of of the nomination hearings where he spoke after professor for after professor Ford and\nHis words this whole two week effort has been a calculated orchestrated political hit filled with a parrot pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election fear that it's been unfairly dumped about\nAbout that I've got a stuffed about its usual record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups a number of law school professor of also expressed alarm that\nThen judge Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh was no longer a so called neutral umpire calling balls and strikes that based on his remarks he was not displaying the requisite judicial temperament set on the Supreme Court\nI'm Laurence Tribe committed that it's personal attacks and Senate members as partisan tirades do more than simply display of striking in judicial temperament they disqualify him from participating in a wide range\nOf the cases that may come before the Supreme Court case involving individuals or groups that just as Kevin has now singled out um\n[noise] I guess this list and wants you to tell us your response to all this do you think that he can be that neutral umpire do you think that he should be or could be recused for some of these cases\nUm well they're always cases where a justice can be recused but as I see it there there are a couple of different questions there first of all is he a neutral ... higher\nAnd the answer is no no justice is a neutral umpire every justice comes to the bench with a certain ideological preference with the certain notion of\nA jurisprudence to the importance of precedent and so on so they all bring baggage um to the bench or the other question that's always raised is a is justice cabinet does he have\nThe demeanor of a judge and I have to say that I I was appalled by\nThe display a at the Senate confirmation hearings I mean even if you're going this was a job interview and even if you're going to interview for a job flipping burgers or if the interview starts with you know I really like beer I drink beer and sometimes I drink too much beer\nChances are you weren't going to get the job and I remember a there's an old saying when you want it to describe somebody who was very sober and had his wits about and you describe the person as being ... a judge and the implication there is that sobriety\n'em and patience and calmness and equity um are all part of a judge's tool box on the judge 'em should exercise those um I I think just justice Kavanaugh\nOn may have a hard time doing that on the other hand\nUm he's managed to sit and now for several years on the DC circuit court of appeal um which is that considered the second most important coordination\nUm and he's managed to survive\nOn as a judge without any sort of behavioral problems I think he's able to keep it together on the bench\nUm how he does a back and chambers I'm how he does in the conference room I was the other justices we don't know but I sort of have the feeling that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the others on the court can that can hold their own against him\nSo I you know even though I I I I think the display was was\nCan survive on the bench and even if his demeanor is not that great I'm Jeff and and I both know that often we encounter judges who demeanor are not perfect I mean both of us are in our many years of experience of encountered\nTirades from judges irascible judges angry judges indifferent judges um so that happens I I don't think that's necessarily going to be a problem even though you know you worry about somebody who comes to a job interview\n'em and talks about\nHow he loves beer ... well let's let's let's hope you had a tic tac or something before he came in\nAnd also the ... the notion that he buys into conspiracy theories and especially when he buys into conspiracy theories when a woman like Dr Ford is testifying about something\nThat obviously happened to her I mean that accusation that somehow somebody like Dr Ford would come before and not just the Senate Judiciary committee but before the whole world and under penalty of perjury testified as something that happened to her\nAnd she is somehow pond and some giant conspiracy I I think it is very disturbing and there's a lot about that mentality that does disturb me\nAnd with that David from Berkeley Welcome you're on your legal rights yeah thank you very much can you hear me yes\nYeah absolutely I I'm so says he started the program with er an assessment\nOf your predictions regarding the nomination I Would like to um have you consider a prediction that I recently made that first of all I should say that uh I Love your example of the of the church if that's\nDriving a with respect to religious liberty I Am a a I'm a member of that organization myself a and I\nBelieve in scrupulously of aging all motor vehicle was with the possible exception of the of artificially low speed limits\nOh you you might want to repent from that David\nAdvisable yet I'm here's my prediction that within a couple of years with regard to reproductive rights there will be at least twenty states in which there is only one or no abortion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Legal Rights", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
