{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Legal rights it's teaching\nListening to your legal rights on K O W Ninety One point seven FM in San Francisco I'm Jeff Hayden tonight will be discussing proposition ten in landlord tenant law\nYou have questions from my guest our phone number to us right here in the studio is for one five\nEight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling outside of the local area or if you're calling outside of San Francisco call us at our toll free ...\nEight to five five\nThat eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nMy guest in Studio ... tonight is might go to landlord tenant attorney south implanted with offices in San Francisco Sal is of course the frequent participant in color and frequent guest right here in the studio as well let me welcome you back to your legal rights\nThank you Jeff it's pleasure to be here and while we may be talking about specific areas of landlord tenant law you can call regarding any landlord tenant question\nI Want to encourage you to try to dumb I guess but any landlord tenant question you have from my guest is welcome and again the phone number to us right here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three four or five you're calling from outside of the local dialing area\nAre toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and again that number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and I'd like to start here or\nSo before the show we were talking about proposition ten just what is proposition ten\nSo a proposition ten is a\nA\nInitiative to remove\nCoastal Hawkins from California state law and the coastal Hawkins\nA provisions ah prevent\nCity\nAnd county governments from imposing rent control on all the properties within the jurisdictions they can only imposed them on certain properties and and not the others\nSo as I understand coastal Hawkins that limited to older properties are properties that are perhaps more than roughly Twenty years old\nThat's correct and and for example or the way it works in San Francisco I'm no rent control on anything built after Nineteen Seventy nine June of Nineteen Seventy nine no rent control and there's also no rent controlled regardless of of build date on single family homes and condominiums\nDoes this actually change the local ordinances are only enables local ordinances to go to older homes good point Jeff it does not\nProposition ten does not end itself change any local ordinances all it does is repeal the California coast to hop in state law that's that's all it would do and then the local jurisdictions would then\nI'm\nImpose their their rent control as they see fit because it's within their jurisdiction to control to control rents and vacancies so they'd be able to control both of those without any limitations if prop ten word to repeal coastal Hawkins\nSo if I live in a suburb for example that doesn't have a rent control scheme it sounds pretty unlikely that this would change anything for me\nI think that's correct if the I think you're correct that probably would not change\nEarlier tonight when we were talking and as the there's calls coming in so if you're on the line please be patient with you in just a moment um but earlier tonight when we were talking we talked about proposition five proposition five is not a landlord tenant ... per se but what is proposition five and\nI'm simply would allow um\n\nHomeowners fifty five years or older to sell their homes purchase more expensive homes and essentially keep the same\nA percentage of tax on the more expensive home\nI'm so it's an incentive to them not only to ... to ... to\n... it doesn't a disincentive eyes moving but it's also an ... it's an incentive to buy a more expensive home and and not have to pay the the are more expensive tax on that home they still take take their percentage tax from the old home\nNow I'm not a real estate attorney but\nMy understanding of prop Thirteen is that it allowed somebody fifty five or older\nTo sell their home to downsize without paying a tax penalty that's correct and as I understand proposition five is that lifting that requirement to downsize and basically letting somebody has been grandfathered in keep roughly the same tax rate it\nIt does it does allow the purchase of a more expensive home without the if I don't want to call it a penalty but what ... without paying the same tax that somebody unfit under fifty five would be paying\n\nAre there any other issues that you see coming down the pipeline whether it's on the ballot tonight or next month whether it's something that might be coming up and bill\n[noise] well you know I I hear a lot of talk of um\n\nPerhaps the state should consider subsidizing\nUm housing with with\nState funds rather than individuals\nAre being required to subsidize housing to rent control uh but I don't know you know that that that's probably come up before but I you know I don't know how\nHow uh how close that is but that's that's something that I've been hearing a lot of lately surprisingly I thought it was a novel idea I don't know where it's going to go and I haven't thought it through but but I Do hear about that Jeff\nNow the governor has signed a flurry of bills last week or you are any that were like the landlord tenant that there's a whole host of bills that were signed that relate to criminal law but ended that relate dilemma tennis that your way\nIf there are Jeff I'm not aware of them I I haven't heard of anything that somebody did that affects landlord tenant law are particularly in San Francisco or or anywhere really I just haven't heard of any\nI see the lines backing up our first caller though rather than wanting to be heard on the air our first caller actually left the question behind wanted me to read this off the air um this caller is a landlord\nAnd the question is I have a duplex in Stockton and it's recently been for sale it's fully rented\nOne of the tenets has been there for three years the other for over Twenty years\nThe buyers had made an offer that I've accepted but they require that I'd give both of the current rent or the sixty they notice as they want to occupy both units for themselves and their family members\nAnd the caller's question is what if any financial obligations does he or she have towards these tenets that are going to be forced to move out\nUm if the settler who's the current landlord a surf sixty they notice is one financial obligation will be to deal with a security deposit\nAnd uh also uh\nThe sixty they notice I mean the attendance may not move they may have a basis to to fight the notices and then there would be a financial obligation there and also time because the eviction process [noise] although an expedited process still takes time\nSo that may frustrate the closing you know maybe prevent the closing I I don't know\nIf the landlord has to return to a security deposit how's that calculated\nSo a state law requires that a landlord returning the security deposit or I should say let me back up requires it the landlord provide a and accounting for the security deposit within Twenty one days of the move out of date\nAnd uh um\nTypically landlords will include the security deposit refund with in that Twenty one day period but what's important under the California state law is that the accounting is provided within Twenty one days and the money should be too but it's that the statute isn't so clear on that but most landlords will just provide a refund at that time\nUm and and the refund is for a damage to the unit not for regular wear and tear but for for damage um and it's up to the landlord it'd be reasonable in in how they charge for those things if\nThey should be able to system and finding somebody for somebody with limited means to be able to find a lawyer in this area that works in that\n... than we can on the air when we can't see any of your documents or see or what's happening in your apartment or my suggestion is you'd call the Contra Costa county bar association there telephone number is nine to five eight to five\nFive seven zero zero and they would be very helpful for you to have somebody that could look at your letters and really give you a sense what to do next and do it tomorrow first thing in the morning ...\n... ... ... for a pool for the whole\nYes the phone number two the Contra Costa county bar association lawyer referrals service is nine to five eight to five five seven zero zero\n... who wore and Tara Tara um if you stay on the line\nThere'll be somebody I Know me by friday ... okay well I understand\nI understand and if you stay on the phone somebody will come on the line and just a moment that will talk to you off the air can take a bit more time with you and give me the number is okay\nMake yo ... thank you for joining us and best of luck and tough and Steve from Oakland welcome to your legal rights\nHi there how are you I'm well thanks how are you very well thank you I have a quick question I have the building\nSix units in Oakland and homeless have moved in the area there's the who live under the overpass and my tenants say that they've been breaking the mailboxes and stealing mail\nI've gone over there changed locks a few times I Know it's my responsibility but at what point do why is is that enough is enough where they need to get a camera or some security 'cause I Can't be watching over the building I don't live there\nAnd I'm Steve is that yes so if a if the mail boxes are in the common areas it is yeah then if you are the only one that has control over the common areas the tenants don't um would they can\nGet in it's like right in front of the building it's an older Edwardian style building and I don't want to change the integrity of the building in one of those ugly big boxes and everyone has their own little mailbox yeah Home Depot kind where I can pop Locke\n\nSounds like I'm going to last year devious still with us and can you hear me yes yes now you're back so yeah\nIt's one of those crime where they're just they're older and mailboxes they're not super cheap but I can replace the locks so what I'm trying to do is just figure out is it my responsibility at this point if I have to go over there you know once a month twice a month to change these locks\nWell I I ... with respect to security cameras in my opinion that would be your responsibility because it's just going to be in the ... so if you're going to go that route\nI think it's it's your responsibility to put up the security camera or the the perhaps you can keep those mailboxes there it sounds like they look nice where they are but but maybe a you know\nPut a mail box somewhere else I don't know how feasible that as I understand you want to keep the integrity of the building and and the aesthetic value but um there's got to be a fix to this obviously you should you know let the police now I should encourage yeah and it's to let the police know so it's a you know a building wide effort but if if you're going to\nThe lady to do if that's necessary you know I I don't know that it's necessary maybe you can put a mailbox\nSomewhere else you'd have to alert the post office and maybe put signs on those mailboxes as say the male is now you know to be deposited southern place you might actually have to go to the post office and and tell them that so they know where to place the male ah but you know I'm sure you've considered that already but maybe look at it again or anything else I can uh\nWell yeah I'm just wondering is there any with the homeless situation that's happening in Oakland and they're moving in everywhere\nUm is it possible I I don't really know I mean maybe just to put up a locker or some kind of gate in that common areas what I'm thinking\nUh as long as the advantages I'll have keys to the gate and edited the security gate um you know without seeing the building I I'll just I'll just assumed that it would be a security gate and and be welcomed by that\nMight be the only solution then\nI could give you another one that might help I don't practice landlord tenant but the one thing you might you might consider is they have security cameras you can pick up fairly inexpensively whether at home depot Lowe's or even online than Amazon for a few hundred ... or something\nI've seen that\nWell they'll go back to your cell phone so it'll alert you of something changes and you could even give the address or the specifications the attendance so that they can monitor their own mailboxes on their time with the camera that you put in and that might pose a partial solution mhm\nThat sounds good to me I didn't think of it that way I didn't know that they could so if I'd either system each person can monitor it on their phone\nPrecisely a you should be able to set that up that's a few different ones out there I Am not sufficiently familiar that I Would advocate for anyone but it might be a place to start looking for a solution\nMuch appreciate it thank you and have a good night thank you for joining us\nTonight\nAnd again you're listening to your legal rights I'm Jeff Hayden tonight we're discussing proposition ten and landlord tenant law with San Francisco landlord tenant attorney south tempo while we may be speaking about proposition or specific areas if a specific people you should feel free to call regarding any landlord tenant issue\nWhether the landlord side of the Senate side or any issue that may be pressing for you um again our phone number here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling from outside of the local dialing area feel free to call us toll free\nNumber eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\n... mark in San Francisco welcome you're on your legal rights\nCould evening a so I have two questions the first relates to propositions and so I live in San Francisco and I also own a a condominium that I read out to a couple\nAnd so I understand that with the repeal of Costa Hawkins was the last two individuals who has the power of this to a set standard\nI'm Wondering if we could look into a crystal ball if your guest has any um thoughts about what would likely be the course in San Francisco and specific to my case\nAre they going to extend rent control to single condominiums um what what might I expect because I'm I'm a I'm I won't say wary but uh I'm concerned [laughter]\nUm you're not the only one on both sides of the issue um the San Francisco board of supervisors up until very recently maybe a few days ago um they were silent on their position they now are supporting prop and then they're supporting it\nThe way um they they specifically included condominiums in in what they would control as part of what they were control if prop ten repeals coastal Hawkins so what you could look forward to in that circumstance\nI mean it's it's a gas at this point the you know they haven't made any decisions but they're probably start off by just imposing the same rent control that San everything else just rent controlled\nAnd they can see controlled so depending on when you're condo was built you may not have vacancy control but you would you you could potentially have vacancy control on it\nUm you know if ... were repealed\nOkay thank you my second question is I'm\nAs a result mark before you get there I'm going to ask you to hold that question for sure the moment it is close to the half hour or so we do need to break for just a moment you're listening to your legal rights and we'll be back in just a moment\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referrals service can arrange for you to me within the journey experience in the area as a law related to your situation for one size\nNine eight nine when six one six or does it s S. bar got still RG for more information and that will get that ... your legal right here on a on a leash Francisco [noise] thank you\nTo base plus all the on paid interest in ... a yearly interest amounts that will become your full security deposit and then to any subtraction is will be from that\nNumber that makes sense\nUm whole okay to pay for the painful um\nAte it it'd be a ... year whatever he did in the insurance where for that year correct and and you add that to the security deposit habitat for ...\nIt gets added but it doesn't get added in for the second year it's always the base that that the interest rate is added to the base security deposit doesn't increase for purposes of adding the interest rate\nOh yeah yeah well the ... the the the security problem which I've hundred dollars for example if you're going to be five hundred dollars cut the interest for the year ... every\nCorrect if it was it was and I'm just going to choose a random number to make a map easy if it was five hundred dollar deposit and the industry was ten percent and you were there five years you went up to five hundred dollar deposit\nAnd ... dollars a year for the for the five years so you would have two hundred and fifty dollars coming back for those five years in addition to the five hundred dollars yeah that's a good example\nOkay All right but already okay thank you for joining us they don't they're not they're not required to pay that and yeah they\nWell they should be paying it every year if you want him to you can ask them to pay it to you and and they they'll pay it to you you know that they they're supposed to pay it every year if they don't then it just gets handled at the end when you move [laughter] yeah\nThey design You're welcome thank you for joining us and Omar from Oakland you're on your legal rights welcome\nA high yeah they are ... on ah my daughter leaves say I well first I have a ... flying um uh my\nDaughter who live at home or we were thinking of gave in a city did they know it is to to the lower than that it's a two bedroom apartment and so she can leave them there\nBy now the upstairs you own a cat like K they because they bought a house that is a three bedroom two and then what will be my\nI mean nothing has happened yet this this all happened in ... was speaking\nOr so since the unions is same the has the or at least a three bedroom these kind of a big unit would pay a load of a lot of money for the mortgage I mean we can't afford to have my daughter fares so the idea was to have the cheaper your name\nFor her so that you can leave there so what would\nBe my\nWould be in my ... my colleague or or you know ... or whether the pain that Iraq would be in because the unit upstairs the same the rain now could I have read them I mean and even the ... did they notice\nTo the lower unit\nLaw where you were in that ... per unit the upstairs now is more expensive here in his bedroom so you know we we like to keep it ... you rent it because it's going to help with the the mortgage\nBut the lower your new ... one of my daughter to um buddy you know before there was a dentist and now there is more than an upstairs\nIn for wanting to lower unit unfortunately I'm not familiar with the details of the Oakland rent ordinance so what I can tell you is a you should call to rent a rent board in Oakland\nPose that question to them and then perhaps called the ah local bar association\nAnd get a a referral to an attorney and Omar al ... for your benefit the Alameda County bar association also maintains a lawyer referrals service and pay their number is five ten\nEight nine three seven one six zero\nHay and sitting seven one six said okay I figure if further west related to what the color of their ... and you know from Britain control for whatever\nThe exact right and that's where you'll find your answer I was writing thank you very much I think if you're joining us welcome and we're going to stay with the Oakland our next step is Sabrina in Oakland welcome you're on your go writes\nYes hello thanks for taking my call mine's a commercial rent a commercial space\nCan you handle that one probably okay good so anyway um I two years ago I had ... and they'd my business and because I have a a caterer that's white behind me and the past two years I have lost\nMy wife's earnings there and so my businesses have gone and uh the landlord tried to give me an eviction notice I Do have the least and I'm as do I have any reason precautions can I what can I Do their way I can collect some of the money that have lost\nA you know the answer to that question is going to be primarily in your leash or what you're responsible to do with the landlords responsible to do and then the facts that you can\nA show for how these rodents are getting into your unit that does the landlord also own the building in which the catering business is located\nYes it's a huge building to cater had just come at a time like within nine months and I got infected with Iraq I mean I have videos and pictures and he had just inherited like in your two years ago\nAnd so he he inherited the building I called them in September and he gave me an addiction though there at that time the real estate wasn't in the news\nSo I didn't even know my own leaf and that so I have to hire a lawyer just to maintain and I figured it out and got rid of the lawyer because he was doing whatever the landlord wanted so he raised my rent five times within two years\nBecause his father didn't raise the rent every year it's a huge building so it's commercial and ... have been in the entire buildings but he took care of all of them and I met the end\nSo all direct came running to my place but I deal with ... it's a beauty shop so I deal with people all the time so I lost half my visit they didn't come back\n... show rats were visible from your sales floor\nYeah absolutely and they died on my floor on they ate up my wires my phone my my towels my I mean you can hear the moving so that's why I lost a lot of customers even though I never told them I have ... and instead of the landlord helping me he just threw me a notice of addiction\nAnd told me that he has a renter already have them I have that recorded what does the VIX you notice\nThe time he gave me six days to get out\nAs the days past\nOh yeah this is this is like two years ago so it's already took care of that and then I hired a lawyer because I realized I had at least just kicked me out\n[noise] yeah\nThey only became a bully and the lawyer agreed with them where they know anything it badly about real estate law and um so he raised my rent five times within two years like I said and didn't raise any other neighbors just my um so they got scared so he was using me as an example so nobody open their mouth\nBut I'm the only one that lost clients\nThey have a different kind of business and he did take care of their ... but he never took care of mine and I did bring the um exterminators and um I had several of them come out so I Do have written proof that where they came from they located the area that came from\nSo I had nothing to do with it they came into my business\nWill Sabrina I think you've got to get familiar with your lease and see who's responsible is now I Am\nFamiliar with the least I was at that yeah I Am yeah I'm completely familiar with the lease but you know nobody wants the lawyers don't want to go after it so I'm not sure what to do I mean he's a pretty tough guy owns a lot of property so they just don't want to mess with him\nWell they may not be ... I mean you've got to get somebody to tell you if you have a sword he under the least to shoot the landlord for your loss business profits that's that's what this is about\nYou know I spoke with my um insurance because I didn't tell them at the time but my problem is I Want to make sure that I have a case before I approach them because they're in church said that they have to\nTalk to the landlord and investigate but the minute they talk to him I'm sure you know my least is going to be up in two thousand Twenty one and I don't want to be forced out\nAnd so that's why I wanted to make a make sure I have a case before I can even do anything I mean now that is willing to come in and do the investigation and look at my video all this stuff\nTo Brett you might consider getting a second opinion from an attorney whether it's through the referral service or whether it's a private attorney or that you meet with that can actually look at your lease and give you some good advice yes um", "show_name": "Your Legal Rights", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
