architectural critic Charles jinx this garden is I quote a joining the terrestrial nature with fundamental concepts of modern physics including quantum mechanics super string theory complexities theory and many more\nThe movement I Want to play is called the fractal terrorists\nAnd fractals are an interesting idea it's just a\nPattern that is infinitely repeating and it's the same pattern regardless of scale into things that turn up in nature a lot and so it would be relatively easy to reproduce in a garden if you think of a tree matter how large or how small the tree is the pattern of
