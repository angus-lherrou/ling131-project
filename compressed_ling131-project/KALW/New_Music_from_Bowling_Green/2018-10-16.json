San Francisco temperate relevant\nI was inspired by the salinity beauty and reverberate qualities of the space\nAnd the great lengths that the creators of his memorial went to in order to express adequate honor and respect [noise]\nI had a great uncle who died in World War one and this knowledge made the building very significant to me\nI have a cigarette lighter made from two British coins which I thought of often as I wrote this\nSince this is the Veterans Memorial and was built after World War one there are references to taps and reveling in the natural harmonic played by the cello and much of them a lot of material is based on the popular World War one song over there\nThe intent is to take a listener from somewhat turbulent memories real or imagined to optimism and hope\nThose are the words of composer Elizabeth start on her teeth to remember to believe which we're hearing performed live\nIn a decidedly non traditional concert environment in fact it's being performed at the el ... memorial\nIf you've ever driven on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and taking the diversity exit driven west right at the top of Lincoln Park you've seen it it's a dome big dome you may not even know what it is it is a memorial to veterans who served in who lost their lives in World War one\nThat piece to remember to believe is being performed live as part of open house Chicago\nBooking relevant tones I'm set those dead taste program is called open house I'm featuring audio that was recorded in a variety of different buildings in Chicago and in Barcelona as part of the open house project\nIs the project that my company access contemporary music produces every year it really is our mission to bring contemporary music to as many new people as possible so how do you do that what can you do well one of the things you can do is you can leverage successful events that already exists an open house is absolutely one of those it began in London oh about twenty some odd years ago\nAnd it's basically a celebration of architecture in your city it gives people an excuse to be a tourist\nIn their own town it spread to Chicago in two thousand eleven open house reached out to us and asked us if we wanted to have a musical component\nWe've done it ever since and it's been a huge success so we commissioned composers to write music inspired by buildings we put musicians in the buildings and on the day of open house they play the piece of music but every Fifteen minutes or so and the idea is that it's not a traditional concert environment\nSo this is not the normal scrubbed clean audio that we have on the program this is right out there in the field we're going to bring you into these buildings so in today's program I'm going to play some of my favorites over the years it's going to be a lot of fun\nFirst up is a piece by composer Tim corpus that was inspired by the women's lounge at Union Station\nWhen Union Station was going to be in the open house project I just was so excited I really wanted to include it at one time it was the busiest train station in America\nIt it's just a fantastic space it's built in a in a row cocoa design is very much class assist design which so much of Chicago buildings are and if you think of Daniel Burnham all the great buildings that were put up\nIn the Nineteen tends Nineteen twenties right around the turn of the centuries to marvel this building but then the little cherry on top of the Sunday was that they were going to open up the fabled women's lounge this is a room that have been closed for decades and probably Seventy years\nBack when the waiting lounges where we're segregated by gender\nOr they haven't used it for any other reason in fact I had a great opportunity to go through the space to be given a tour of the space before open house and it was amazing to see the stuff that's been stored in there for decades it was just a really really incredible experience so what temp decided to do because the space have been closed since before he was born he had no personal connection to the space\nHe decided to try to find a letter by somebody who\nThe Nineteen thirties when when the lounge was open the letter was written by Richard Adler known as true though she was a young immigrants from Germany and the letter was written on July tenth Nineteen thirty for Tim says the simple letter is a small look into the ordinary life young woman finding her way in Nineteen thirties Chicago\nTo me this letter in bodies the excitement in Grand or Chicago the point of view of a young lady special thanks delivered grossed me wonder if your son's let me use his mother's letter here are just re Miller cello alongside Christie mother no relation clarinet to perform letters home by Tim corpus this is the first\nTime anybody who was hearing this music had been in the women's lounge in their lifetime first time ever\n\nMm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nMm\n\n\n[noise]\n\nMm\n\n\nShe's

implements over the years\nTo the box at this lovingly called by students at the Illinois Institute of technology that's building is actually the car chapel C. A. R. R. and it was the only religious project that means ... ever worked on in his long career\nAs a non denominational building it is absolutely one of the most simple designs I've ever seen which should not surprise you if you know the work that we spend a real this is the less is more person after all\nBut he really took that static to an extreme in the car chapel and although it's not that I'm ... I really do feel that there is a sense of spirituality pervading the building is a place where people walk in and immediately fall into a hushed tones and it certainly inspired the composer Katrina Burton who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland can all the way over in Chicago to be president\nAt open house Chicago [laughter]\nShe says about it a fan of modernist architecture particularly admire be spent arose work not only has architectural designs but his skill as a craftsman revealed the his exemplary understanding of materials such as that was employed in the design of car chapel\nWestward for solo cello and bodies misses the static of less is more establishing it powerfully yet contemplative atmosphere one which creates space and invites the listener to focus on individual musical tones and their properties much the same way that a closer inspection of materials in the chapel\nSuch as the Trevor teen marble alter the Toronto floor and the ... panels rewards us by reading\nGod it's been a detail your is William Jason rented the to perform for me like a train to Britain and again this is live the car chapel that's part of open how Chicago two thousand four\n\n\n\nMm\n\nMhm yeah\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThat's different them into for flu and cello by Sarah walled diverted into was a light piece it's really a dance like piece\nFor the nobility and the Eighteenth century which I think it's fitting because it was performed live at the map and her house which was built by Chicago to ability\nIn Nineteen oh too it's now the grand foundation which is an organization that supports architects and architecture so sitting\nMember of open house Chicago the piece was performed thereby Gabby Vargas on flute and Alison burger on cello as part of open house two thousand fourteen we worked with open as Chicago as I said since two thousand eleven and then in two thousand and Fifteen we were approached by doors open Milwaukee which is a similar event\nIn Milwaukee and we've worked there for a couple of years and I found out around the same time that Barcelona has an open house project and I was very excited because just personally\nI have this Barcelona thing [laughter] I just have this connection with that city\nI remember the first time I went there I I just fell in love and not the only one it's just a magical place and I loved it as soon as I heard there was an open house project in Barcelona I just wanted to work with them in the worst possible way this year in two thousand sixteen we did get to work with open house Barcelona was so exciting\nAnd as a composer for myself I had never\nDone any of the open house projects I always stayed out of it I commissioned other composers but boy you know when we got Barcelona I just said okay so [laughter] this is it you're going to write one of these pieces and so I'm going to play that piece now and this is also the first time I've ever played a peace of mind on relevant tone so it was just kind of a momentous occasion hair\nThe building is called the ... and it was designed by a disciple of and Tony goatee it has that very same style but then also has more classes just approach especially in a couple of\nThe building was a hotel it's now been converted into private residences and when you go in and it's essentially just a a large oval shaped lobby and you look up and there are all these balconies maybe Fifteen balconies going up it's almost a dizzying look\nAnd there's a couple at the top is beautiful or next couple of law\nAnd so we were performing at the bottom of the space and it was a magical day because what they decided to do was to do it as a series of guided tours so they were letting a hundred and twenty people in at a time\nAnd this woman would explain to them all about the building and the architecture and then I end my whole the Spanish would tell them about the peace and the musicians would play it we repeated this throughout the day for three hours it remains\nI just one of the most incredible arches experiences of my life so I'm going to play the peace for you now the musicians are wonderful there from the Marcus ensemble and on some work with in Barcelona before they are Francesca ... on on violin and when it come Mari shallow I simply titled the peace must be Mikhail here is a live performance from open house Barcelona\nTwo thousand sixteen\nMm\nMm ...\n\n\nMm\nMm\n[noise]\n\n... you\nIt's interesting [noise]\nUm no no\nMm\nMan\nOoh Mm\nWow", "show_name": "New Music from Bowling Green", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
