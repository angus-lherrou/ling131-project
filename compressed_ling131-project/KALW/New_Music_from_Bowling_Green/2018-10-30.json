register for that instrument comes in with that figure in Michael Toner ... down word to me at least it's somewhat reminiscent of the opening up the rite of spring\nBut ... it's a completely different line but nonetheless there is that interesting quality of the solo instrument opening obese grabs your attention right away it's kind of ... there's this other worldly quality to it especially when the other instruments commend the composer genome theory layers the core tones in this really\nWonderful way we're hearing the flu the bass clarinet of course 'cause a lot lower than the regular clarinet and interestingly the accordion [noise] keep listening [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIt's a piece by Irish composer genome theory it's called a ... way through to me at least\nIt sounds like there is this thicket of core tones if you will there's always this overlay in effect\nOf the court tone throughout the peace and the way through it would be perhaps where the listener is there a way through this can you hear where this is going and it's a great title really provocative and thought provoking in that way it's also scored for a pretty interesting instrumentation weird Madeleine ... out the flute\nAnd Paul row bass clarinet alongside Dermot done on the accordion so interesting instrumentation and featuring the accordion I think in a really unusual but great way in a chamber music setting\nWelcome to relevant tones I'm set those dead on today's program we'll be playing a lot of music and chamber music an orchestral settings that features the accordion\nOf course we think of the court and we think of it as a folk instrument if you've ever gone to Paris and you're on the metro you're going to hear accordion players coming through the trains I've heard it in Poland I've heard a lot of countries in Europe but the accordion is actually a popular folk instrument all over the world as it turns out\nAnd in the late Eighteen hundreds of started slowly creep its way into classical music settings usually the composer was trying to evoke a particular kind of folk imagery but by the time we get to ... some composers from the early part of the twentieth century it's very much being taken seriously as a concert instrument\nAnd when you get to our own time now we have these accordion virtuoso is all over the world who are actively commissioning new pieces\nAnd they're really pushing forward with the accordion both in terms of what's possible physically on the instrument as a virtuoso but also what's available by composers again commissioning so many new pieces for the accordion\nAnd well here several of those rituals says on the program today\nNext step is a piece by Japanese composer talk show host the ... the composer I've always been interested in I heard his studying of Edgar Allan Poe's the raven\nAs part of the first New York philharmonic by any ... about three years ago and it was just stunning music he has this incredible ability to transport the listener into this other sonic environment completely different in separate from anything that you've really hurt her experience before so I was taken by this piece called slow motion\nAnd this is for solo accordion player here hosts the cow is trying to evoke the world of God a coup which is ancient Japanese court music because his back when their capital was an ego\nAnd there were all of these incredibly complicated rituals and writes surrounding the Japanese court and that apply to the music as well so does this very ceremonial music\nHere is ... is a low key to perform slow motion by ... and one of the things that I Want to mention really quickly is not every accordion is the same you can definitely get different sounds out of different according to one of the most striking aspects of the pieces is that the accordion is asked to\nAnd he's playing with a composer calls the doctrinal dance in the mood like so much for that\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWhich was the ceremonial music in the imperial courts in Japan if you can imagine yourself in Ito back in the day this is the kind of music he would have heard except it would've been performed by a small orchestra comic who was for several instruments and here\nWe're hearing this for the solo accordion ... really interesting juxtaposition was performed by ... ... a great ... recording us\nPosters definitely wise people who's pushing the accordion into new directions and the piece was called slow motion\nIn the last piece we heard the according to being asked to emulate the show which is a bamboo pipe instrument\nAnd the next these were actually want to hear an indigenous Asian windows instrument the shame is probably one of the oldest instruments known to humanity it's really an incredible sound and it's going to be buried of course with the accordion the pieces by finish composer told me racing and and it's called gatekeepers\nTold me said that in this work the two instrumentalist act as gatekeepers or filters of musical material and textures\nThroughout the peace various types of medical situations we presented\nSome of them will be rejected right away some of them will be transformed to be more appropriate as it were to the gate keepers so the musicians here are sort of acting in a metaphorical context they are deciding the course of the piece as it goes forward just really interesting way for a composer to structure a work\nYour way Shane ... accordion to perform gatekeepers music of finished composer told me recently\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOoh\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nExcuse me if I told me racing in the piece is called gatekeepers for Shane an accordion it's pretty interesting isn't it took a cut an indigenous instruments from China Shanghai ... organ played there by the way and we have the accordion\nPerhaps best known as folk instrument from Europe in South America all over the place and they're combined in this really really interesting way which is also another piece it opens with a solo instrument I think the Shanghai is again very arresting much like the ... that we heard at the very beginning of the program there's this kind of\nImmediate quality of oh wow what what is this I Can't wait to hear more of a species scrape music by told me racing and\nFixed up as a piece called glimmer this was by composer Richard warp and this was written for stuff's been gloves ski and I have a story about stuff than gloves ski because I I Know him\nHe is or perhaps the foremost virtuous of accordion player in the United states he's unbelievable he's one of the few people who plays the button accordion\nNah [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nMm\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nMhm\n\n[noise]\n\n\nMm\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThe piece of music performed by a duo called too hot to food which I think it's a great name for any ensemble really but it is an accordion at percussion duo we heard so the ... on accordion with ... ... gross percussion they're performing a piece called metal work by finished composer maneuvers Lindbergh\nThis is the work that was composed more or less around the same time he was reading crash a large scale orchestra work\nThat is kind of unbelievable in his intensities just hugely intense these gigantic percussion section et cetera here has taken a lot of the metal sounds that you hear and crash and transfer them into a more kind of shit Murray wavy sound that I think ... really really well with the accordion the great work metal work we heard as much as we could get\nOf that piece I was actually a live recording\nFrom the final round of a competition in Baron\nBlessed be someone to play on the program today is by Danish composer parent or a guard and this was kind of a an interesting piece and interesting stories and interesting composer me just tell you that what about him so he's in his eighties now and he's having his amazingly career renaissance all of a sudden his music is getting performed all over the place he had a big\nPremier by the New York philharmonic last summer for example the U.S premier it was a symphony you had a big premier in Helsinki is getting all of these pre mirrors and commissions around the world\nAnd it's very late in his career he's in his eighties\nPrior to that he had really kinda flown under the radar for sixty some odd years if he tried out a lot of different styles and I think a lot of this is just he was sort of born in the wrong time if you will I mean he's not so interested in the cereal techniques a tonal music that really marked the music of the fifties sixties seventies eighties and even into\nThe nineties he was interested in finding a different way of presenting tonality and we're going to hear that in this piece is called recall and it's for concerto in chamber orchestra and it is a total is music gets it's amazing to me that this was composed in Nineteen sixty eight because this was a time when a lot of composers were saying if you weren't writing cereal music\nYou are of no use that you were actually backwards looking in hurting the history of music and so paranoid guard in this context is writing as these knowingly to me it's like an active rebellion in a way casting off the guiding principles of his teachers of his fellow composers especially the composer that are older than him it must have been really hard to do\nA very brave act when you hear the speech you're going to hear that it's inspired by folk music\nWhich of course was appropriate for the accordion and it is very tonal it's also a beautiful piece of music\nIs in three short movements called recall we're going to hear ... on a court in this is the person for him to pieces written and he's performing with the Danish national chamber orchestra led by real scoop to here's music from Nineteen sixty eight for accordion and chamber orchestra by paranoia
