A. L. W.\n[noise] so I wanted to ask this question to each of you in turn a I'll start with you here Lisa him in the studio um how would you rate\nUh the the state of um ability to vote in our country at this at the state or of time and and politics and what we're going to unravel tonight in terms of factors that seem to be getting in the way of people voting how would you\nDescribe how easy it is for people to vote how does it vary\nBy person by part of the country just each of you in turn just to get a sense of where you're we're starting from\nWell just because they I think it's important to know that the United states is among the lowest in advance industrialized countries in terms of voting rights and I think there are many reasons for that but we have to put\nThe current situation within that broader context we have always made it very difficult to vote comparatively speaking other countries had election day as a holiday they have elections like over multiple days\nThey have other ways to facilitate the process we've always had a very high bar we require registration pretty far ahead of the election we here in California because of the initiative process had ballots that are books I'm filled with language that most humans don't normally understand\nAnd we don't provide a tremendous amount of assistance or an integrative work to help people who might you know maybe have lower levels of education or who aren't necessarily paying attention to politics\nThe facility to to enter the system so it's not by accident that are voting rights are so low and they're especially low for people of color and people who are low income people who move off and people who had multiple jobs you know the people who are really in precarious economic situations and so\nI I Would say we're um and scale of one to ten probably for in terms of access and are the the work that we do where the facility with which we help people and to the political system\nAnd what what score would you give California specifically\nI think California is doing a little better than we are nationally um we've had a lot of it\nThe talent and California is just that we are so big the scale is so big and we have so many um ... immigrant origin voters naturalized voters people whose first language is not English we have\nMany low propensity voters and so California has an extra need to make an effort to ensure that in fact the voice of the entire electorate and not just certain sectors the electorate actually gets heard at the ballot box every election day\n[noise] All right I'm Indian ... a year go next what's your sense of the the uh the state of of voting in our country and I have a California compare\n[noise] well I Would absolutely agree with um the summary that Lisa just gave 'em we're not doing very well and when you compare us against others hapless democracies um [noise]\nWe are are certainly not the the beacon a of a democracy that many people think that we are at least in terms of voting um\nYou know what what mostly what Lisa described as a are what we call the institutional barriers around voting we don't make it very easy for people to vote and what California's been trying to do over the last number of years\nIs making voting and ... men and registration more accessible I tried to break down those barriers um the thing that I'll add to that is\nThere's this other component so I I think of voting as a kind of two main buckets of parts to this or we think about the problem we're trying to explain and address the low turnout one is we need to make it easier for people to vote that's the institutional side of things and we also need to make people want to vote\nAnd those are both related very much so but the one to vote and\nWill fall then there is people feeling like their vote matters are people feeling motivated to participate that if they take their time and the energy to actually physically going voter fill out that ballot mail it in to do the research to be deterred responsibly right to be informed\nUm that they think it actually makes a difference and makes a difference not just in terms of the election the outcome like who wins that makes a difference for themselves and their families are communities and\nA lot of Americans and a lot of Californians have a a really difficult time seeing how voting is connected really matters is connected to what they care about and to their life and to their life chances and um we don't do a very good job to health reasons for that and how we talk more about that over the next hour\nBut we don't do a very good job of encouraging people to vote aside from the institutional barriers so we have a\nWell we don't have an expectation of voting is completely socially acceptable to not vote 'em in our society particularly for young people [noise]\nUm and and then you have this other component is huge component people again not feeling themselves right motivated and why it matters in a lot of that gets labeled as apathy and I think comedy when we think of apathy we think people just don't care they don't give a darn what's wrong with those young people today why aren't they participating [noise]\nYou know why is there the sleeping giant why aren't Latino voting more all that kind of all those labels that we put to people\nAnd really sure there's always apathy in in that sense of not caring but uh I I Would argue that almost everything we see is what might be labeled is apathy is you know this real reasons five people are not participating why they think their vote doesn't matter and their family disconnected and that's an area that we need to do more to address\nGraham definitely want to talk about the intersection between obvious you know barriers and the and the um the sense of lack of engagement I'm a a lack of a sense of um\n[noise] uh ability to to have a an act changed through the vote so a room with the U.S with the ACLU or I Want to go to institutional barriers a little bit more in your comments around how we're doing um as a ...\nTo help with the issues of of a concern of uh on equal access to voting um uh for some of our population here in the state uh tell us your take about um the institutional barriers to voting\nWell\nI'm In terms of thinking about how the country rates right now I think we're out of\nIt seems that we keep reaching new um new low points we've had in twelve years ago the country or our Congress renewed the federal voting rights act nearly unanimously um but since that time there have been said he attacks around the country on voting rights\nI'm I think we're seeing\nA well we're reading about it more and more in states all around the country in particular since um since two thousand Thirteen when the\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down I'm searching for the of the voting rights act that's allowed states that used to be under um it's called what's known as pre clearance so when they made changes they there was a a a burden on states to to show that their changes wouldn't um\nWouldn't uh will were not discriminatory against racial minorities um since um since Trump or restrict down we've seen an increase in states that previously would covered by pre clearance and in passing\nBarriers here institutional a in a barrier a sense of lack of a engagement or a sense of lack\nOf ability to influence politics if you kinda have to give us a abroad overview um obviously the Latino population is quite diverse in of itself\nI mean I think it's important to to know that there are multiple Latino electorate depending upon what state and and and what area you're talking about but I think\nNever last week essentially saying that if there is not as big of a blue wave is people want to because the Latino voters are still asleep I'm I an image that I personally I agree with Monday's offensive [noise]\nAnd so I think we really have to remember this was a structural problems so not only do you have a low voting rights overall in the United states you have\nSystematic large disparities in boating across different communities and we generally put the onus of that difference on that can be themselves and say they're pathological they're apathetic they they they just don't care rather than thinking well what are the structural so it is these institutional barriers but it's also the fact\nThat we simply don't talk to them so if you add together so most campaigns use these up ... scores in order to decide who to talk to during an election because they they have limited money they can't speak to every voter and they usually only talked to people who score above Seventy essentially if you're above Seventy it means you're likely to turn out I'm not going to waste my time\nIf I talk to you and if they get a bunch of extra money maybe we'll go under but usually those are the folks\nIf you add together those folks\nPlus the people for the midterm election at least plus the people who are unregistered among Latinos is basically eighty percent of the citizen voting age population among Latinos so exactly the point that then\nThey're not getting campaign information they're not having an even knock on their door\nThey're not having to anybody call on the phone and so if they are interested in the election they have to go out on their own and find their own information and do the the legwork themselves and so it's not only that you're making it hard so that's a barrier you you're sort of creating a higher bar to actually engage so that you can gather the information\nTo do exactly on the menu was talking about in my work with Latino voters because they care so much of a voting they don't want to make a mistake and so they need to get good information and that's really difficult and the current information environment\nBut secondarily it also means that they're getting the message that they don't matter right so that means candidates aren't talking about policies that they care about so there's a whole ecosystem which makes it very clear that this is not a space where I should spend my time and we're actually going to take care of the things that I care about and so we have to appreciate that\nYou know even in this current mid term Jim kind of party has not spent the money that it should spend towards ... so if I didn't let the numbers don't turn out it's actually because\nThe investments were not made it's not because they are somehow pathological detached disengaged in fact if you talk to them is what I found in my work if you knock on their doors if you have a conversation with them about the things they care about they will turn out to vote the problem is no one's knocking\nAnd why is that right I mean if you're if Democrats are looking for a strategy to to turn things around a next week or two and twenty twenty of this keeps coming up and yet if not changing\nBlame when I called the political industrial complex which is basically a consultancy class so that people who run campaigns are generally speaking folks who are\nIf I can be Frank there are sort of their their privilege white men by and large\nAnd they have a strategy that they've been using for the last Thirty years which is essentially to reach out to white likely voters and they try to flip the three percent of swing voters that they can flip to persuade to vote for their candidate and that's what they say is a winning strategy and if you think about all the post mornings I came out after twenty sixteen and all the discussion of white working class voters\nUm ... among the Democrats there were three post modems of about thirty five that were done that actually talked about voters of color and what happened was that it was a color so you have this whole ecosystem of how we run campaigns that just doesn't see\nReaching out to voters of color is a winning strategy and those are the people who decide how many spent and those are the people who decide and the other not to sound conspiratorial issue is that if they buy ads they get a percentage back and so\nYou know focusing on television focusing on advertising actually makes them a whole heck of a lot of money putting canvassers into the field and having them talk to voters face to face doesn't and so there are a lot of incentives to keep campaigns running the way they\nIn case you're just joining us this is city visions our local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco\nAnd on the Web and KLW dot org I'm just a ... inch night we're talking about barriers to voting a amongst of voters in general but especially a communities of color or here in California and across our country or just one week\nOn a day away from the maternal election\nUh we have three guests Mindy Romero founder and director of the California a civic engagement project and ... voting rights project manager attorney the ACLU northern California joining us by phone and here in the studio Lisa Garcia ... director of the Institute of governmental studies and chancellor is professor in the graduate school education at UC Berkeley\nOf open our foremost you our listeners now to join our conversation\nUh eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email us at city vision that KLW toward\nPost a comment to kill the website or tweet us at city visions K. A. L. W. Mindy did you want to say something there\n[noise] oh I I was just going to add something I absolutely agree with everything that Lisa laid out there [noise] um they're very related component to this is so you've got you do have this industrial complex you have campaigns and candidates and their consultants using the likely voter model and Latino and and by the way young people to type back into our conversation about young people\nAh don't aren't procedures letters and numbers right I'm historically don't match that and that's a big reason why young people are participating in a lot because they're also not getting that outreach and mobilization when I wanted to add\nThat beyond does that strategy around campaigns you know when we're often when we're seeing news stories were looking at the overall aggregate numbers your turnout numbers right at the state level and we're comparing it over time and were saying you know these are not you know these are not good numbers or their disappointing numbers are there okay numbers um\nAnd when we do see mobilization outreach that is targeted which doesn't happen very often but when it is targeted\nWe have to remember that it is about what's best for the candidate or the campaign and so even in this election right now where there is some aggressive mobilization of people of color and young people it's only where we typically at least\nWhere those candidates have deemed those groups could possibly strategically right be worthy of their investment and be a good return on their investment\nAnd suicide from the political right the strategic campaigns kind of almost everywhere else\nWe're not seeing 'em a whole lot of engagement of young people or people of color and often and in the community at large right if it's a safe district and we have to just remember that those that are primarily responsible for that at ... campaigns and candidates those are the ones that have the you know do the bulk of the outrage and ...\nAre are just being very very strategic in in\nWho their average into and often very safe seats are doing very little mobilization\nAnd how could we then expect right realistically when we talk about those news stories that say you know will the Latino vote or will use though to ... you know whatever group we're talking about will it be higher this year\nYou have to realize in a vast number of races were not even seeing necessarily any additional outreach or any additional funding that's coming in to do\nThat to mobilize those groups ... really unfair and unrealistic expectation and it does set up for the day after election day those narratives around failure\nRight ... thanks I'm quoting something that ah that you said earlier roe [laughter] you know like be so you can't be everywhere a Kennedy can't be everywhere but but but it seems at the same time perhaps short sighted to only go where you where you\nThink you're going to be able to to benefit from is that is that what you're saying like\nWell I'm not necessarily even blaming the candidate says the campaigns themselves because they they have a ... or obviously strategic purpose\n'em but it's just a recognition if we're talking about expectations and we're talking about that narrative of failure and we have to understand kind of their realistically how you know what that landscape looks like and understand that and many of these districts or is there is really very little outreach mobilization period going on\nWhere it is happening it's happening very strategically um it is based on often old models or misunderstandings right misperceptions or even by us\nUm and it just has these very real consequences and we may on the surface right or talk about or in our in the media to talk about well you know all these factors should mean that we'd see you know all this turn out right for Latinos for instance right\nBut it comes down to you know local districts and local contacts often and the set of or ... of ... and that is happening or is it happening um and we have to understand that\nYou can be very motivated to they could be a lot of factors that logically would see would should get out of you hope would get out of a group or an individual to vote but everybody needs mobilization everybody needs that outreach so you you have the factors that are in play but then they have to in a sense be activated right you have to be grabbing pulled into the electorate right now we leave\nWe lead groups particularly circling underrepresented groups um on their own to if they get if they see factors that matter for them we essentially from in many many instances are leaving them on their own to then say\nOkay I'm going to vote and act on it and they're not getting the outreach and mobilization that's so critical in our system to turn them into voters and again thinking about expectations and then we wonder\nWhy we don't see that the turnout and we blame we bring groups themselves for why they're not turning out when they didn't get that activation but other you know those that do fit the likely voter model did get that touching that outrage so Lisa and that makes sense\nAh people who ... who languages first language not English or who are uh who are voting perhaps is the first time when they turn Eighteen how much of a big size not getting it right meaning worried that they're not going to\nVote correctly in a sense it's a mess up the ballot or that they somehow think like wow this is just way too complicated\nTire out I I think that's the reality it's a very intimidating process many people don't know that they can vote for the top of the ticket or not and not vote at the bottom of the ticket or they or if he can I skip the judges right the judges are always the ones you can never get information on\nI actually had a voter provisional ballot because my point pace changed because I wasn't paying attention this last election and as someone that works in this area it's still felt very kind of dicey like is is actually going to count\nAnd so appreciating the lack of basic information was a machine look like how do I fill out the form can I take my sample ballot in to remind myself what I've decided I'm going to vote on can I bring my child with me because actually you can in the state of California many people don't know that\nSo I think just appreciating it feels very official is feels very important it feels like you could very easily make a mistake and that that is really intimidating for many people and that if we got rid of that sense of intimidation we actually would probably have many more people participate in the\nProcess Mindy [noise] I agree um we probably should say that uh you're a provisional ballot will in all likelihood get counted [laughter] and so people can trust in the system um [noise]\nBut that intimidation factor doesn't really matter and I think it will add to that as you know often when when\nWe're on we're we're Research Center but we do a lot of outrage and the sense that we we talk about um our research in the research in the field and his route and about doing that\nWe do get a lot of questions from people that just don't that say I I don't get it I don't understand why voter turnout is low I don't understand why I'm young people\nOr other groups right are participating in lower rates why it's so hard it's really you know if if it taking\nAlong the lines of blaming the victim but but a little bit more to that right saying it\nWe don't really need to do anything else because it's already pretty simple what's so hard\nUm and it is if you're unfamiliar with the process so most of the people that are saying it doesn't seem so hard what's the big deal or people that are probably die hard voters vote every time and even then at least they just said you can still have those moments where you are uncertain\nBut if you've not voted very regularly or you've never voted before she very first time it can be incredibly intimidating and it can be a barrier for why people don't participate um it why they if they don't feel they have enough information that they don't know about the judges is always the judges\nThat didn't maybe then they don't sell out that built by mail ballot because they literally think they have to submit everything and they're trying to actually be responsible and that process so I think remembering that and remembering when we hear that criticism sometimes that's why people aren't voting it's very easy if you're very comfortable with it to not get why it's not so\nRight not such a no brainer for many many other people and and we don't we do we make it harder right for people also to get that information if they're unfamiliar with it at the last few years have been a number of\nAvenues now that you can you you can go to voters actually went voters have lots of different places you can get information on candidates judges are still hard um you can go to secretary states off as a what the website and identify whether your vote by mail ballot with actually counted um yes you do have to sign your ballot on below\nSignature doesn't need to match um the signature that's on file um so but there is information available to again many voters don't know where to go and that that information is is available so that's also very\n... thanks for answering the questions of the of the listener there yes go ahead rule\nWill just um\nIt's always call at eight six six hour boat in election protection hotline that can answer some of these questions I think some of these they can also district to their county elections official I'm somebody some specific to their to their situation\nI'm an eight six six hour vote as a election protection hotline that I'm a ... you can call okay and what languages on if they have ...\nYou know I think they have what they have a number of language a bill introduced staff but I Believe there's also they use 'em\nUp you know a translation hotline if people are calling and language that they don't have um someone who's accent language\nOne ensuring that yeah one group we we haven't talked about that if we think about this issue of of trying to engage and remove institutional barriers among communities of color is\nA communities of color are are convicted felons or you know we've we've been talking a and you know at various points are about the representation and and the prison population of people are who are convicted of felonies is there any work\nBeing done in organizations that you represent or\nOr that you know of that really is looking at that issue because that\nCould be definitely seen as a a pretty large institutional barrier\nAnyone can speak a little too there's a show you here in California we ever done this for decades um there's\nWe have a website that people can go do for information um is it an area that there's a lot of confusion about who's eligible to vote I think people hear news from other states and they get confused about who is actually eligible to vote [noise]\nUm but in general unless you're serving as a federal or state prison sentence or unless you're on parole for the conviction but ... you're eligible to vote in California we have a Web site let me vote C. A. dot org that people can visit for more information where\nThey can also call there do they election protection hotline or the ... elections official I'm here in California we've we've passed a law um a couple of years ago to make it even more clear that it's only people who are on serving serving Pearl for much of a felony or in state or federal prison\nWho can't pump to if you're in county jail in general you can vote if you're on probation you can vote if you can conduct of a misdemeanor or you can vote\nIf you're awaiting trial you can vote 'em and unfortunately I'm\nWell there are a lot of people who are still aren't ineligible because of um either because they're on parole are in are in prison but what what happens you know too frequently I think is that people um\nUnfortunately um believe that there are ... about 'em because they had a conviction at some time in in their life and um I think that they\nThey can never registered to vote again and um that's not right and I appreciate you asking that question\nAnd just any work and trying to reverse of the restrictions on those serving time or whether in their shoes me in custody or on parole or is that just kind of like a nonstarter\nWell\nYes there during stations were working on this isn't I'm a great organization called initiate justice that tried to qualify a ballot measure um for for November they they came up short but I Know they're going to continue to work on this we in California to go any further we would need at a constitute a constitutional amendment I'm unless\nOur governor took some action sort of you know laterally is what they did in New York where I'm Governor Cuomo issued essentially what er I'm partial pardons to people on parole to restore their voting rights and so that's another avenue that we could take in California at least that you wanted to say something there\nJust wanted to lift that unless you're only mentioned in terms of the misinformation and we did a study and back and Twain Fifteen looking at the reasons people give for not registering to vote and and uh\nEighteen citizens and so I think it's not only people who who have a conviction but I think sometimes people who've had any interaction with the criminal justice system believe that that has made them ineligible and so that misinformation disenfranchise as many people beyond just the actual uh incarcerated or or formerly incarcerated population\nSo lots lots there to to turn around a in terms of people's perceptions of their of their right to vote 'em [noise]\nSo um India there was something of that Lisa said earlier about the um would call them ... ballots is that right or is that is that a strategy or being thought about a in schools or to try to get even maybe kids who can't vote or\nA art of voting age and maybe a couple of years beforehand to kind of just getting the practice of the habit of doing it\nYou know when it's too early to start on voter education\nOh it's never too early to start [noise] ah actually I I Am looted to really briefly that there have been some changes in California recently there's momentum um happening around civics education\nUh through a group called the power of democracy which was a started earned supported by the chief justice of the California Supreme Court and I believe with support from the state superintendent\nOf schools and they are actually uh through a task force that they created um produced a report called K. through twelve set of learning really encouraging trying to make the case for\nStarting in kindergarten or in some form a talking about and integrating the importance of civics um through through lesson plans of the curriculum\nUm it shouldn't be certainly but it is right now which is your you know one semester and your senior year your government class in California and it shouldn't just be um high school so one big tool which we mentioned earlier\nThat schools now having those that work with young people have it's the pre registration so as folks come into schools right organizations they give them a boat or other great groups\nAnd I want to talk to kids about voting on a register kids are talking about the importance of registering they can actually pre register sixteen and Seventeen year old so that's pretty exciting but it shouldn't be just then when the ... part of the establishing that norm around voting and that cultural expectation of voting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Visions", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
