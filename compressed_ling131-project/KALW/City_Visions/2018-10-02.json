{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Tomorrow morning at ten here on Ninety One point seven ... I O W San Francisco\nMm\nGood evening and welcome to city officials on your host grace one tonight is the first of our election coverage theories we explore the opposite pros and cons of San Francisco's proposition C\nA measure that would raise taxes on large businesses in order to find housing and mental health services for the city's most vulnerable residents San Franciscans are no strangers to the debate on the city's housing and homelessness crisis with rising rents and at least Seventy five hundred people on the streets\nYeah on San Francisco's mind proponents of proposition C argue the biggest big business has added to San Francisco's housing shortage and rising inequality\nTherefore it should contribute to the solution [noise] opponents of the measure worry that companies already paid the lion's share of city taxes and may leave San Francisco in response to an additional tax therefore taking jobs in revenue with them [noise]\nSo tonight we ask is proposition see the answer to San Francisco's housing in homelessness problem or will this measure Dr companies and jobs out of San Francisco as opponents fear fear\nJoining me in the studio to discuss these issues are Jennifer freedom Bach executive director of the ... coalition on homelessness an organization helping to develop the leadership skills of homeless San Franciscans so they may fight for permanent solutions and human rights\nThe coalition on homeless homelessness is a sponsor proposition C welcome Jennifer for having me on the phone we have ... the former senior advisor and communications director for recent San Francisco Mirren supervisor mark feral he served of the ... campaign spokesperson\nJustice delete all homeless policy and initiatives for supervisor feral and is currently vice president arrest city strategies will just\nJust are you there\nSort of you know and no problem also joining us by phone from the beginning of this hour is Heather night of San Francisco chronicle columnist who covers homelessness and the politics of the city welcome Heather\nHi thanks for having me great and we invite you our listeners to join our conversation by dialing one eight six six seven nine eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five [noise]\nUm I started out talking to talking about this issue with you Heather keep set the stage for us about um homelessness in the city in particularly what currently is the city of San Francisco doing to attack the homeless problem and how much is the city spending\nSo as you said there's about seven thousand five hundred homeless people on any given night that's an estimate from the um the last one night\nHomeless count which was then a over a year and a half ago about half of them are on the streets and about half of them are in shelters hospitals and other facilities that number hasn't changed that much over the past several years that it's become much more visible as development has driven homeless people out of their former\nHideaway like the old chance they terminal and other places where they weren't so in your face and now I think residents are seeing this\nUm issue much more than they used to and so they feel like it's gotten\nA lot worse the city spends about three hundred million dollars a year on this problem and it um created at thrift department of homelessness and supportive housing about a year and a half ago to really focus on this issue\nUm we have navigation centers which are um homeless shelters that provide more case management and more relaxed rules and try to help people find a solution beyond homelessness\nUm there's the ... team which is an outreach team that goes out on the sidewalks every day trying to help homeless people um there are other um programs that the city has that people feel like it's just not getting any better and so they wonder where their money is going but um people say that we just aren't spending enough money and that's why the problems seem so bad\nWeather you did a recent column about how what it really costs to help the homeless um that came out in the chronicle on August twenty fourth break down for us how that three hundred million dollars is being spent\nYeah so there's a perception that if you just divide three hundred million by the number of homeless people like we said it's about Seventy five hundred that the city must be spending more than forty thousand or a homeless person per year\nWhich is is not true because a lot of that three hundred million is not spent on people who live on the streets it spent um [noise] a major chunk of it that is a two thirds of spent on supportive housing so that's formerly homeless people keeping them\nNow at another chunk is spent on ethics in prevention trying to keep people from becoming homeless\nSome of that is spent on administration capital funding so when you look at the amount that goes to people living on the streets currently it's about uh sixty million a year\nI'm which I'm it's just not a whole lot plus when you look at the fact that the Seventy five hundred number comes from that one night count and the director of the department of homelessness says his um staff actually serves\nTwentieth are Fifteen to twenty thousand homeless people every year so it's a lot more people in a lot less money than people think\nAnd the kind of services that we're providing now as a city you mentioned navigation centers and supportive housing what about um the mental health issues that homelessness um homeless people often face\nYeah I think that is really where the city of falling down on the job I'm anybody who walks around downtown seeds people in huge mental distress who clearly are not um in their right mind and who are not getting help and the city pretty much so that the pen sometimes they're taken as a general but under state law they're almost always released within Seventy two hours\nOff and back to the street because we don't have enough treatment beds for them to get real helped and there's an effort in Sacramento the governor just signed legislation that will make it um it easier to consider people but San Francisco still has to um opt into that and figure out how it would do that so that's a ways off\nAnd this that perhaps the with the about Seventy five million a year or two more mental health care\nAnd do you live in is proxy something that all the supervisors are supporting right now\nI Know that\nProgressive ones are there some moderate supervisors who are opposed and they are Lyndon breed um last I checked pet not weighed in on at one way or the other\nAnd what do you think London Breed hasn't made a statement about prop see she she campaigned heavily on homelessness\nYeah she was waiting for the ... report from the city's economist which just came out a couple of days ago so I imagine we'll hear from her and I'm I suspect she's analyzing the results of that report which essentially said it would cost the city\nSomewhere in the area of seven to eight hundred jobs per year a lot of those with the retail jobs so that is something to be concerned about but it also said that it would um help the homeless and the situation on the streets and we would see a difference in terms of mental health and homeless\n[noise] well this is a proposition that your own paper does not support um what do you think about that\nThe newsroom and the editorial board have a wall between them I don't have anything to do with their decision\nRight um well let's get into the proposition itself we have one of its proponents here with us Jennifer ... Jennifer can you tell us what proposition C actually does\nYeah happy to um just to\n[noise] I'm\nOne thing about what how they were saying I'm which I'm sure we have seven of the board of supervisors members who are supporting it one who's opposing it and then the remaining have not taken a stand\nUm but uh so yeah so proposition see it's really\nReally really exciting I'm I'm really thrilled to be here to talk about it um basically how it works is that it you know it's just very common sense approach because it's funded by a very tiny tax on the city's largest corporations um it's an average of a half a percent\nUm and it's only on receipts over fifty million so if I'm a company has fifty four million coming in only the four million um would would be applied [noise]\nAnd um you know this the way we profited really carefully over the past year I'm In this inclusive process that included people with lived experience business owners um elected people on the front lines you know the folks who see what works and doesn't work I'm On a daily bases\nSize where all the dollars have to go half of the funding has to go to housing and we think it's going to um find based on that um homeless departments um strategic framework about four thousand units of housing housing about six thousand folks\nUm including families with kids I'm twenty five percent and mental health and substance abuse treatment um we can do a lot with that and a lot of amazing stuff that's not is hampered with Medicare funding in all these different regulations around\nUm around the funding streams and bought a thousand shelter beds would be able to get rid of our\nUm for the most part are weightless for shelter in San Francisco I'm and provide a bathrooms and hygiene centers and you know our vision is to have a system where\nWe and a big piece of it is prevention I'm keeping people in their homes because of course the majority over Seventy percent of our homeless population became homeless his house San Franciscans and there's all these different situations that had they had people had the resources they never would have become homeless oh an elder who's\nOn income is fixed in Iran slowly signing up above their fixed income or a catastrophic health issue or\nUm you know folks who need long term help her short term help 'em so we would be able to really um barricade that pathway into homelessness with this measure as well\nAnd how much do you predict how are you hoping that it will raise so according\nSo we're we're talking about is taking a little tiny fraction of that tax give away\nAnd then capturing it and then re allocating it to turn around of crises that was caused by that very same federal government that very same federal government that is not going to save us in his crises they're not going to pull this out of this there that cause of this\nCorporations and you know and that's another piece that came out of the you know the econ report is that you know these companies are they're they're no companies are saying that they're going to be paying more than they did a few months ago they are going to be paying for far less [noise] um before we\nGo on with that that's a city visions on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and on the Web that KLW dot org\nTonight we are discussing San Francisco's proposition see with our guests Jennifer freedom buck executive director of the coalition not homelessness and sponsor of proposition seat and ... former senior adviser and communications director for recent San Francisco mayor and supervisor mark feral and now on the campaign spokesperson\nWe invite you to call in with your questions or your comments is a business tax the right solution to our housing shortage how else should San Francisco addresses homelessness crisis or you likely to vote yes on prop see why or why not\nThe number to call to join our conversation is eight six six seven eight talk\nThat's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email or text us now at ... at Yale W. dot org or tweet us or post a comment on our Facebook page I'm Jess Jennifer was saying that this is the right time and um what do you think about the city economists report\nYeah I think the city's economic impact report showed massive insurgency jeeze oh guaranteed outcome whatsoever in terms of what the proponents say we'll do\nUm you know again if you look at the ... page report 'em if businesses move out of San Francisco which is very likely here give it a high talked with that exist in San Francisco and I'm very much lower originally in the East Bay on this topic\nUm the the uncertainty here in the impact of middle class in Franciscans and the potential to rich transportation golfing housing costs are very severe you know obviously we go through the report I'm In a different you know I just wanted to look at the big on the street look at what we've seen over the past decade\nA decade ago if you if you ...\nWe were spending nearly three times was on a home with his budget ... where we are today nearly three times more at the same amount of homeless people again there's a lot of issues that contribute to that but what that tells us and its supporters are opponents of this measure I should say is that more money alone is not the sole answer to that\nYeah but it's much deeper than that there's not a one size fits all solution were arbitrary number was awarded factory increasing says history is going to solve homelessness wants him for all its performance pointless just simply not true to\nLook for what he said that there is three hundred million dollars in the budget for the city to addressing homeless issues and has had her pointed out a majority of that goes to supportive housing this proposition is talking about permanent supportive housing as well as one of the solutions to the problem is more money um the right answer to resolving the problem\nDon't think anyone thinks she can solve homelessness without spending some money I mean it's so bizarre statement to say that\nUm we're spending the same amount of money and we have an old people\nBecause we have a house thousands and thousands of people in the meantime and we've we've had thousands more homeless people more people become homeless in our impoverished population in San Francisco we have a massive housing crises I mean get real all up and down the west coast massive housing crises\nAnd so you know as as ranch keep going up and up as people lose their housing as all the speculative real estate happened so I mean all these ... everybody's familiar with what's going on here\nUm and so it's you know if it was the same seven thousand people who were on the streets um and we had an housed anyone in the meantime but were housing\nYou know I mean we've got Ninety five hundred formerly homeless people that are in housing 'em your former boss push for more money for bus tickets out of town we've lost six thousand people out of town we've I mean I could go on and on but the reality is that what our approaches ban has been a piecemeal approach and that his ...\nA little bit there and it's not enough and we have this opportunity to get serious about it and to really turn it around and so you know this this is really our chance and I think you know [noise]\nReally the vision is about values and about the values of justice and equity about a vision for San Francisco where we go upstream half of our homeless population became homeless before the age of twenty five\nIt's astonishing we're not serving families with kids this initiative is going to make sure that we're addressing family homelessness so thousand of our um four thousand housing units are going to come out of this are going to go towards families with kids were going to make sure we address youth needs\nUm we're gonna go upstream we're going to make sure that San Franciscans don't become homeless and so it's really a thoughtful approach about how we address this crises in the long term because let's face it\nWe've been in this for three decades we cannot keep going that the unintended consequences of homelessness are overwhelming our city we have thousands of police calls responses were spending forty Cape per person\nPer year on emergency room cause\nWe had you know just another death that happened were confiscating people's property constantly taking away their medications we just took you know we just had an overdose because people didn't have the nor can that just got confiscated by the police of fatal overdoses someone died\nYou know this is the stuff that we're facing and we we've got to turn around this crises and this is our opportunity to do it [noise] I'm Jennifer what do you say to\nUm people who are thinking about voting to about this proposition and maybe the concern that they have about how money has maybe ... has probably or could not have been used efficiently um and the oversight that's going to be provided by this proposition to how the money is going to be spent\nYeah I mean you know you look around and you're like what\nYou know and what's happening is is that everyone who's going is getting turned away we're spending in San Francisco we got twenty five hundred shelter beds were spending twenty four dollars per person per night were underpaying the staff\nWere over extending our contracts are dropping centers let me just take cap street for example there contracted with the city to serve a hundred people a day you've got three hundred and fifty people a day going through there and they're more working hard jobs that really low wages and they're well they're saying look we need to turn this around were willing to take on more work to turn this around\nAnd so you know it is we you know we're the failure is is that we ... we don't have the capacity were getting everyone is getting turned away\nYou you're you know we've got a thousand people on our weightless for shelter we have seven thousand homeless households trying to get housing 'em you can knock yet I'm supportive housing San Francisco right now unless you've been homeless for Twenty one years in San Francisco\nThat's how we have to prioritize are supportive housing right now because of people who've been there the longest are get the top priority and and so that's not okay we need to dial that back\nAnd really you know get people into shelter right away um move 'em into housing as quickly as possible or else we're spending much more money keeping them homeless than we are housing them [noise]\nAnd and who's going to oversee the use of the funds yeah so I mean the ... the the it's pretty pretty you know the the initiative says exactly where all the money has to be spent\nUm which I went through that already um it there is an oversight committee that I'm a that will basically be looking at doing and need there'll be doing it needs assessment and looking at accountability so there'll be tracking those dollars and looking at whether or not the city spending them effectively\nUm there's going to be at ... you know and of course we're this is we're so interested in this because we want to make sure that you know this is done right and so we'll be bird dog in this very aggressively to make sure that um that money goes where it needs to go um and then every dime spent effectively it\nStuff ends up happening through nonprofits um\nAnd ah we know where to housing can go already um there is going to be a lot of work to be done absolutely um but we were really careful about constructing us initiative in a way that it was\nFully accountable um that it utilizes best practices and that it builds on a plan that's already in place well it seems from the looking at the proposition\nThat the um members of the committee will be appointed by the board of supervisors and the mayor is and the controller is\nNot really a tough it's half bored half mayor and then the swing see by the controller\nUm but I just want to know one of the things is each of the seats on is you know we're trying not to have it be a body where they just stick people who may be worked on somebody's campaign um we see that a lot on our commissions and so this is supposed to be a working body\nSo each of the seats has you know they have to have experience in an area and bring some expertise to the table um because we really expect us to be a working body that's really laying out okay\nUm you know how how do we do this right and looking at best practices and data and where the gaps and and those kinds of things right I think we have a caller on the line a\nLine one star child from San Francisco\nAre you there can your yes go ahead with your question\n[noise] yeah so um\nSo they knew they were mentioning the opponents organizations opposing prop see earlier um they didn't mention the Libertarian Party which is a ... on the local out with stricter we definitely has a\nAnd a ... I mean it it is\nA huge amount of money and the fact is already spending like three hundred and eighty million dollars a year\nOn homeless programs and services and yet you know for most of the past decade the number of homeless people on the street ... official count has been about the same of the current approach is working and and I don't think that they're proposing to do\nTo the fact that San Francisco can't shoulder this crisis alone this is a regional issue that deserves a regional response\nUm again you know ... with folks moving their jobs to the areas that\nHave lower cost in terms of transportation and housing to think that you know Francisco is going to continue this you know strong economic growth a forever simply misguided you know we're at the longest period of economic growth cities history or you know everything happens in cycles here especially in business you know especially in politics\nUm the downturn is right around the corner\nOf the recession you can come in any minute here and if we were wind back to you know I'm I'm fortunate days of two thousand two thousand eight when\nPeople are losing jobs unemployment was you know into double digits but that's the scenario we don't ever want to be again I'm In a city and\nI think you know with prop seeing the lack of flexibility it really provide 'em you know city leaders here to to take a holistic approach at the city as a whole instead of just focusing on one thing to grow a you know issue here is unfortunate and you know one of the the fatal flaw\nMentioned regional it's a regional issue and can you expand on that ... yeah of course you know ... San Francisco you know ... is not an island off it's\nNowhere peninsula you know we have a a an economy that's highly based on tourism business you know there's a common missed\nConception that these big businesses aren't paying their fair share the top one percent of businesses in San Francisco contribute forty percent of the tax base for business tax revenue in uh in San Francisco\nYou know we've had many examples of the business community\nAnd wealthy individuals that are leaders within that company stepping up in terms of philanthropic after I mean our first navigation center was privately funded by a wealthy tech um individual wander ... remain anonymous you know we're lucky to have leaders like Mark Benny off and others who are committed to use in private capital\nAs well to help address this issue and in terms of\nYou know everything being regional here um you know the the the lack of building housing in San Francisco affect housing prices and open and the same for the south than the East Bay and so again to think that just you know the largest tax increase in San Francisco history and double in our budget is going to cure almost as for all of San Francisco\nIs really um you know an empty promise unfortunately\nAt the end of the day well we'd like you our listeners to join in our in our conversation about this this is ... is on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and I'm Glad that kale W. dot org tonight we're discussing San Francisco's prop see with our gas Jennifer freedom Bach executive director of the coalition on homelessness\nAnd a sponsor proficiency as well as just my ... former senior adviser and communications director for San Francisco mayor and supervisor mark feral and\nNow on the campaign spokesperson we'd love you to join our conversation is that this is a solution to our housing shortage are you likely to vote no or yes on proposition\nAnd number to call to join our discussion is eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email or text us now it's ... KLW dot org between us or post a comment on our Facebook page\nI think we have somebody on line one I'm Tim from Berkeley\nYeah Hi there I'd like Cassie former risk to San Francisco as a result of the tech industry\nComing in in two thousand and one I'm I'm ... primary talking point which is a big tax which I'm not sure if the accurate\nBut there is something to be said for the fact that a lot of homelessness in San Francisco have created by increasing property values and ran as a direct result of the tech industry coming\nThe or actually kicking the poor people out suing the president would seem to be with the tech industry created a problem and I would see it's not as if you get from the tech industry left her system as a result of this time I don't see\nAny other way to deal with this problem could you please address phone\nYeah and Tim can you turn your radio down and maybe we'll take your pick your hands are out there ON Technology it's tricky just what do you say about that\nYeah I mean I think the reason why the housing costs are simply so insane that was going to obey areas\nYou know we have the most byzantine process for proving ... out of bed you know city or state in the country\nUm you know it's a supply and demand issue you know fundamental yeah but you know our cities in a building in the region inability to sufficiently build enough housing or reading for the higher housing cause you know potential that ship you know that happened a year out you know every single day\nUm but unfortunately I think the caller's misguided so you know think that if the technology we were to banish\nUm north unfortunately these or San Franciscans many of them are here you know in our community many of these tech companies you know homegrown businesses um I think it's unfortunate uh one bay area residents\nA scapegoat one community against the other to try to benefit\nOf one and I think you know the day um if the technology community were not to be president or Cisco are calling me would suffer as a result in the first people that would suffer from that are low income and middle class Franciscan\nYou know the first jobs to go from ... or not the wealthy executive orders to sweep the executive it's the ministry of stuff the middle class folks that are working in ... every day to try to um survive and thrive on one of the most expensive cities in a region of the other\nQuick question for you that came from a listener so the companies that are covered by the proposition do they include something like a chain chi which is headquartered in another state but has an office here in San Francisco would that be a company that would be covered by this proposition\nYeah ... the company's figure out what their grocery seats are based on their uh production in in San Francisco and so they they already do that I'm In there on business very very small business tax that they pay 'em already in San Francisco and this would be a very tiny one on top of that\nSo it's only it covers only companies that make fifty million dollars in San Francisco as a result of San Francisco\nBased business yeah yeah and so and it's and it's just above fifty million of its fifty formula is just the form in I I just want to mention really quickly died you know this is kind of of you know when we are value is our vision is not about vengeance it's about values but we we really [noise]\nWe've heard the scare tactic before that companies are going to move out of town are going to lose jobs we heard that when we did health care in San Francisco um and the business community sued the city of San Francisco by requiring\nOn the prevention of healthcare that didn't turn out to be the case um we ended up leaving the country and and doing this um they said that with minimum wage um they've set it over and over again every time one of these things comes forward and it doesn't pan out\nUm you know but what does pan out is that San Francisco leads the way and we make change and when we talk about this being a regional problem it is and we have other cities that are already leading the way as well Santa Clara did a massive initiative themselves um where they did a big um [noise]\nA a big bond issue Los Angeles to H and double age where they did a a combination of a revenue measure and a bond measure um we have cities all over the country that are doing this um that are leading the way because we know we can't wait for the federal government anymore I'm so and we have this\nBig tax break that we can then recapture some of that money and use that to transform an issue that has been vaccine I said it it really homelessness hurts all of us and it just seems\nKnow approach what is your thought about the propositions and east Palau town Mountain View that our business taxes are real and trying to raise funds to address the homeless problem\nYou know I'm not as well versed on those initiatives unfortunately um I Do now and chose cumulus south are much much less um you know the void of San Francisco the proponents are proposing here\nUm and again when I talk about a regional issue and no opportunities here you know many in the business community for example or support are supporting the state's two billion dollar how can I mean there are ways to go about things um in terms of solving the issues\nYou know I really you know I've started calling President Obama um you know in terms of\nA lot of outcomes here you know when when when two sides of any issue you know really view it as a zero sum\nAnd are going to move forward and left a hundred percent of their needs and demands are met unfortunately there's no progress you know that it would be able to be made or you know no more progress um you know for folks to to really care about it and I think again it's an unfortunate outcomes near um you know we we could have had an opportunity for a consensus\nCity wide approach we could have had an opportunity you know for a new mayor in for elected leaders to come together\nOr like they've done in the past to\nPresent options for more revenue for the city's most pressing crisis\nBut instead you know we have community leaders you know when I was thankful for you know the folks at work a nonprofit community and provide services on a day to day basis you know there's something to be said about elected leaders you know voters go to the polls you know every June or November\nTo elect individuals that have run on issues that have run out an idea that we had a mayor that just did that you know she hasn't taken a position yet on this measure\nUm but again you know we we really hope that you know there's an opportunity and we're hopeful about the new mayor you know will come forward with a consensus approach here that involves you know all stakeholders to find a solution that's workable for everyone but yet we'll have you know a major impact which um I Know it's possible\nI guess what you mentioned that Maryland and breed has any town taken a position on this have you as your collection had conversations with her about you were on grievances with the proposition\n... the business community in general sure has you know definitely express their opinions and the parents you know I think again you know a base that are left to turn San Francisco you know definitely opposed you know to this measure um you know I think um unfortunately you know it's", "show_name": "City Visions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
