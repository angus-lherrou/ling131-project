one hundred years\nI was ... for that I had the pleasure of introducing a real ... from the stage in front of a full house which included indigenous elders students university officials and members of the [noise]\n\nI mean so Joe ... plenty dacey Gabrielle who's shame good evening everyone my name is\nGabrielle screen shot and I'm a proud member of the hatch it like for the nation from treaty tend territory in northern ...\n[noise] I'm very happy to be with you here and that's the name of a territory and it is my honor to be invited here to give a lecture on reconciliation and I'm candidate future\nNow an elder in the community once told me it was a cold winter afternoon in Ottawa\nHe told me that the strength of who we are as indigenous people comes from the fact that we speak from our hearts and that for thousands of years we've passed down our traditional knowledge history and culture through our stories\nSo I Would like to honor that out\nShare a little bit of my personal story with you\nKnow when they asked me\nTo give this talk I was told to give the perspective of what's in the hearts and minds of indigenous use across Canada in terms of reconciliation so I didn't want to just share my perspective on this stage tonight so I reached out to indigenous of friends of mine across Canada\nAnd I asked them about their thoughts on reconciliation on Canada's one fifty on the vision they had for where we were going as a country\nNow their answers were all very different but they were all incredibly aligned and now well my survey wasn't scientific um I Do\nThink that the answers were telling and for the most part they mentioned three themes the first being the relationship between indigenous and non indigenous people the second being a true understanding of our history\nThe past mistakes and recognizing where we've all come from and then the third was reflections on a path forward where we're going from here the role of language in our communities\nSo this evening I Would like to like I said honor The Elders wisdom and share with you just three stories three stories and three reflections on reconciliation from my own life\nBecause I realized that although he did was born on the hours before the because of who he was being a young for me since child that he would have to face some pretty daunting circumstances not unlike the ones that myself and my family in my community it had to face\nGoing up and I just couldn't fathom that that before ... and had the opportunity to make us\nA bunch of his life the statistics would argue was already made up for him as I'm holding even in the hospital I made him a silent promise I was just Seventeen years old and I promised isn't\nThat I Would live each day you each decision as an opportunity to make life better no matter how big or small I didn't know how that will look I didn't know what the work would be but I just knew that even though eastern didn't have a say in the world that he was about to grow up and\nI did have a say and that I owed him at least that much now after eastern was born\nI decided to apply to university I applied to the University of ... when I applied to one university got accepted to one university\nAnd those four years as they are for so many other people were the most transformative years of my life and my dream of traveling started to become a reality\nI was able to do a study abroad in Australia for shaking indigenous ceremonies in Peru um travel all around the world and through that I started to meet with different indigenous groups\nAnd I started to understand a little bit more clearly that there were common denominator is amongst indigenous people around the world\nAnd while I was at university I was able to understand a little bit more deeply the shared challenges that indigenous people had but also see and be inspired by the strength that we had in our communities around the world\nAs I started to expand my world view I also had a sense of wanting to understand who I Am a little bit more clearly not only as a first nations woman but as a Denny woman who grew up in a creek community and just understand that aspect of my identity\nAnd so that's really what I dedicated those four years too but that doesn't mean it was always easy in fact there were many people who made me realize just how much\nWork we had to do in one of the more vivid moments I realize that not everyone in the world view the indigenous community the way I did\nIn the summer between my first and second year of university\nUm I had an internship and I was in a new city and in this city it was um one evening I was that was about ten people and most of them I didn't know some of them I knew a little bit and we were all chatting and there was this young man who was about Twenty years old\nHe was saying how\nHis father was an RC and the officer his brother was an RC empty officer and his uncle was an RC and the officer and wouldn't you know he was in the process of becoming are applying to become an RC and the officer now\nWhat he said next are words that will stay with me for the rest of my life he said I Can't wait to become a police officer\nSo I can shoot some F ing Indians\nAnd in a room of about ten people about half of them knew that I'm first nations and no one said anything perhaps though most unjustly I didn't say anything\nI felt\nBurdened by it I did the mental calculation should I say something I felt a little bit of shame for the conversation involved and people moved on\nThat doesn't mean that the way to this moment left me in fact I reflected on it for days days turned into weeks and about a month later I was telling my oldest sister Jessica\nLike a mother figure and I remember telling her about what had happened and she's the calm cool collected one in my family and she got so angry at me like I had never seen before\nShe's on young Gabrielle like why didn't you say anything and when I couldn't come up with a good enough answer she says she real who cares about how you felt in that moment what\nDoes that guy does go and become an RC and the officer and the native he grows up to shoot is Ethan\nAnd for me I just remember the breast coming out of my lungs out of every way I had gone over that scenario I had never thought about it in that way [noise] [noise] right that's something I could have said and done could have changed in life\nAnd in that moment I realize that not only do the things that we say and do matter but also the things we don't say\nAlso the things we don't do have consequences\nAnd so slowly but surely while I was in university armed with the conviction of a responsibility to eastern armed or the responsibility of knowing that my actions and actions mattered I slowly started to stand a little bit taller I slowly started to speak a little bit louder\nThis wasn't a process that happened overnight it took me years but in the end I ended up finishing up my degree I became a first generation students\nAnd at the end of that journey I decided to take what at the time was the biggest leap of faith in my life and moved to the big city of Toronto that day that I moved to Toronto is a day I'll never forget\nIt was the first time in my life I had ever purchased a one way ticket\nAnd for those of you in the room who've done that you know how daunting that experience can be\n[noise] if I close my eyes I can still remember it was an Air Canada flight lending it Pearson I had a window seat and it was raining it was a September afternoon and I can still remember the plane kind of taxing towards terminal one\nLater on that evening on the day that I moved I remember seeing my reflection and all of the color had been drained from my face I was terrified I just moved to a city where I had no friends no family and no network\nAnd people ask me naturally why did I Do it\nWell\nI think the answer is twofold first I had an amazing professional opportunity to work with the royal bank of Canada\nThey hired me for a position that quite frankly I was unqualified for I Will admit it and I think they would too\nUm I was never rotational program and they were setting me up with some great mentors they were taking a really big risk on me and I wanted to meet them halfway I wanted to take a risk and moved to Toronto to the city I never even visited before\nAnd the other reason why I wanted to move to Toronto was to remember that promise that I had made to eat and all those years earlier\nAnd recognizing that I didn't feel like I was leaving my community so much as I Want it to be an ambassador for it\nThat in the greater Toronto area we had um you know a majority of candidates had offices and yet we're vastly underrepresented in terms of indigenous leadership\nYou know at the upper levels and I wanted to earn a seat at the table to have a say ensure the perspective and part of you know the indigenous communities in Canada\n[noise] I realized though on that journey on that leap to move to Toronto is that a lot of the support that I had along the way in terms of navigating through high school going to university and landing my job after school\nThat a lot of support systems that were there to support indigenous um students kind of dropped off actually once I got a job\nRight I had an education they had a good job in corporate Canada and I'd move to the city and there I was but for me I was in my early twenties I was just starting off\nRight I just finished university I just started my career in banking and I had every aspiration to be the c._e._o. of our BC one day like my potential I felt like my ambition was limitless but I had no idea how to navigate that space you see as much as my family would have loved to have helped me and believe me they tried\nMy father never had a manager you never really had to put together a resume or\nYou know kind of knew what who to cc on an email so there are plenty of things like this that I realized very quickly that I didn't have an understanding of how to navigate that space it at the same time I've been on this amazing cultural learning journey\nUnderstanding more who I Am as a young woman while I was in university and I didn't want to drown in a city of strangers I wanted to continue on that journey of learning about myself as an indigenous woman\nAnd I wanted a place that I could do both\nAnd so that was a light bulb moment of the idea that eventually grew to become the aboriginal professional association of Canada I started to reach out to indigenous professionals across Canada once I had this idea and start to ask them if they'd sell something similar and many had\nAnd so I reached out and\nThrough an organization called civic action and diversity in particular in Toronto I was able to get the support to launch the organization had my first onto your team I'm a man named Richard will shirt went on to become my cofounder and he's still a good mentor and friend of mine to this day\nThe ...\nThe middle as being the theater on the Vancouver ... university campus was vulgar and but it was an opportunity for audience members to ask questions when the presentation was over ... question shortly but first the conclusion of a real scruples [noise]\nSo where do we go from here\nI Want to share with you another quote the indigenous you shared when I asked him about reconciliation they said it's more than a respectful relationship it's an indigenous power shifts towards full self determination\nNo anniversary is like the one candidate just celebrated our moment to celebrate yes where we've come from their moments to reflect on the past that got us to where we are today but I think there are also an opportunity for us to discuss where exactly do we want to go from here\nWe're at a unique point in time we're at a moment in time for us to get it\nRight for me personally\nThat means one of the hardest things that I can think of in my life which is to mend the relationship with my mother on our land speaking our language that's not an overnight thing\nThat's my life\nThe thought of walking down that path scares every ounce of my being I'm scared part of me the shamed I have no idea how it will turn out\nFor Canada\nI think it means understanding that the work of the truth and reconciliation commission\nWas not the end but instead the start of our journey when we think of progress we need to start thinking of lifetimes instead of decades\nWhen we think in decades we think of the short term we aim to get the gold star and we want to rush the work we think in terms of short term gains and short term prosperity\nInstead I think we should focus on the long term and the lifetimes on the shared prosperity and our shared responsibility reconciliation is the longest marathon we've ever entered into as a country\nAnd if we want to do it we need to do it right\nWhen I asked the use through my survey their thoughts on Canada's one fifty and where we're going to go from here and here are some of the thoughts that they shared with me\nThey said strong indigenous self governments with strong positive relationships with federal and provincial government\nEmpowered first nations communities reinforcing cultural pride an identity on their own terms revitalization of indigenous languages and ways of being in mainstream when I asked\nIndigenous use if they thought reconciliation what's possible on a scale of\nOne to five one being impossible five being possible the average was for\nWhich to me and says cautiously optimistic\nWhich I think is where I land reconciliation is more than an apology reconciliation is more than any one policy it's a critical look at the systems of power economic social political and the relationship between indigenous and non indigenous people in this country\nIt means not only\nSupporting indigenous people but also having the courage to make the sacrifices need it\nFor me I'm going to graduate\nFrom school and just six months now and that milestone hits all have an MBA\nNow there has been a lot of people in my life that have supported me to get to this moment and I want to make them proud\nWhen I feel scared when I feel shame I remember that I stand here and then the result of thousands of years of strength and culture\nAnd that I owe it to my ancestors to do the work that they in many ways we're not allowed to do\nI pursued these two degrees because I Want to help support indigenous economic development I have a vision for communities one where we have full economic independence that I Believe will help to lead us on this road to self determination\nAs my next step on looking at a potentially starting an indigenous venture capital fund that will be indigenous zones be funded by indigenous uh money and then support indigenous businesses\nWhich from what I've gathered might be a world's first it's uncertain work it's hard work\nAnd of course I have no idea if it'll work out\nBut that doesn't mean I shouldn't try\nEarlier I mentioned the year two thousand and twenty six to nine years from now that's the year the four hundred thousand indigenous use will enter the workforce in Canada\nNow that here is also important to me for another reason because that's the year that Ethan we'll have his twentieth birthday and will be about to start his adult life\nIn so many ways that promise I made to Easton and the thought of him being an adult I realize that that's just the beginning of the journey but in some ways that for me is also an endgame I never want him to face the same challenges I had to face growing up\nI Want him to feel loved to believes he can be anything he wants to be do anything he wants to do and be proud of who he is as a young to any person my vision for\nReasons lifetime I Believe is well within our reach but it's up to unite to have the tough conversations and the courage to ask questions about why this is the candidate we live\nIn and how can we do better\nTonight I shared with you three stories\nA story of truth seeking a story of action and a story of lifelong reconciliation I did this and parts that you can see that reconciliation is not linear\nReconciliation is not a destination we reach nor does it come neatly wrapped in a bow reconciliation is hard work\nWe need to press on\nWe need to resist the assumptions that got us far that led us to this moment and move forward in the face of all this uncertainty where to special moment in time where the convergence of many important things from political the social economic to legal and we have to turn around to see\nOur past for what it is to decide on what our shared future will look\nLike with indigenous people on equal footing and we have the opportunity I Believe to get it right now\nAll storytelling I think that there's a bias towards the happy ending\nI was tempted and preparing these remarks to tied up in a way that would make everyone feel good like we had closed the chapter and we had a clear path forward but that's not the way this works [noise]\nMore you realize you have to learn I Want us to be a little bit uncomfortable I Want us to be a little bit uncertain of where we go from here\nWell I Do recommend that everyone read the truth and reconciliation commissions final report unfortunately there is no checklist I can give you of three things to do to be reconciled\nBut if my story is any indication I think reconciliation as a lifelong process and like most things worth while it will take time for us on this journey to get it right I started with an elder story and I want to end with an older story\nAn elder I worked with a lot in Toronto who worked with us at the professional association\nYou once told me a story of how on a sunny winter afternoon he was walking with his little son who was four years old and he was teaching him about traditional medicine and I was ever walking it's very cold and snowy outside as it were trudging through that deep snow\nHis little sun slowly started to fall behind him and as they were walking his son said dad it's a lot easier for me to step where you've stepped see each day every one of us has carving a path and an elder also told\nMe he said Gabrielle make sure when you walk that you walk in a good way for me that means keeping a sense of justice at the core of all the work that I Do it means choosing action over inertia\nAnd having courage in the face of discomfort to keep on walking\nI don't know where we go from here I Know we're at a special moment in time and I know that reconciliation will only work in Canada if every Canadian can turn our hearts in our minds toward this work\nAnd so I review tonight with just two questions and two questions only as you reflect on your journey and Kansas journey of reconciliation which are what are the footprints", "show_name": "City Visions", "year":
