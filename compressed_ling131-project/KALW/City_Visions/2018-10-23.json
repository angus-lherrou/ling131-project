{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Portable housing across the state is the focus of at least three different positions on this November ballot propositions one into our bond measures to make affordable housing more available\nProposition ten our focus tonight would repeal a state law that limits cities abilities to impose rent control that law in Nineteen Ninety five Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nStrictly limited local rent control laws under the ... the legislation local laws that cannot apply to housing built after Nineteen Ninety five single family homes condos\n'em and therefore this is what we're talking about tonight should do hum visa restrictions be repealed prop ten would repeal Costa Hawkins and\nWould remove these legal requirements therefore allowing cities to decide whether they want to adopt but a rent control or decide to make changes to existing rent control laws\nAdvocates a prop ten are rallying around the slogan that the rent is too damn high and argue that something needs to be done to make housing more affordable in the short term\nThose who oppose prop ten point out that economists on the left and right all agree that rent control is a policy that limits and not increases affordable housing as of early October over sixty two million dollars has been poured into the prop ... campaign for both sides\nAdvocates are passionate about the cause on both sides and so we asked tonight what's the right solution for the problem of affordable housing and the ever rising cost of living in California is it the passage of proposition were not\nJoining us in Studio tonight to discuss these issues and more are deep up ... the executive director of the San Francisco tendency union and part of the yes on prop ten coalition welcome ...\nWelcome and thank you so much for having me on the show\n[noise] also joining us here in the studio is Matt regained the senior vice president of bay area council\nHe's up in charge of their housing policy efforts in the bay area council is part of the no on ten campaign welcome Matt thank you great to be here and joining us by phone is Conor Dougherty he's a reporter with the New York times who covers the west coast economics and real estate wealth encounter\nA thank you for having me if I recall into a ... and I had to put my kids\nAnd no problem thanks for joining us and of course we'll invite you our listeners in about twenty minutes to join our conversation I'll give you that phone number now it's eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you could send your questions and comments at any time by emailing us at ... at K. L. W. dot org\nSo Conor Dougherty I wanted to start with you to understand prop ten we need to understand a little bit more about the bill is trying to repeal I mentioned it earlier Costa Hawkins a say a little bit more about how Costa Hawkins came to be a and what is it do and how what's been it's impacting on California\n[noise] so um if I start by saying if the view of the bill is repealed nothing will happen on the first day it gives a option to do\nBasically broader and\nMore restrictive forms of rent control so ... is though that prevents cities from applying rent control to older units which are different in every place in San Francisco at Seventy nine but generally it when I did five [noise]\nAnd ah it also ... um [noise]\nIt created something called vacancy control\nWhich is very confusing but basically I mean if you move out the rent and go up as much as possible or as much to the market rate uh when uh the person was up so that's why people um you know hold on very tightly controlled apartment because uh\nUh probably rent controlled anymore it just goes up to whatever the regular rate is\nBut then just rent controlled kickback in ones that the yeah okay I didn't\nLike that I don't want 'em as you know there are apartments where one person's paying you know whatever twelve hundred dollars and their neighbor might pay\nTwenty four hundred dollars or whatever else and that's because of um\nEven though they're both technically under rent control so [noise]\nUh this can get very confusing very quickly but I think the important thing to remember is that it would allow cities to apply rent control to more units and there were units and it would ah allows cities more flexibility in how restrictive they would be put the rats\n[laughter] so um when you see more units you mean those built after Nineteen Ninety five or potentially in San Francisco those built after Seventy nine ah and then single family homes and condos would be fair game so to speak\nYes there are no current so there you go right and then you mentioned that\nUm it it would be up for negotiation when or how landlords could or could not raise the rent a one someone moved out\nUm but your point or is that nothing changes of the day after the election uh should prop ten pass it then just leaves a municipalities are the option to be able to do things without the same uh with no longer having the same constraints that they've had to\nUh work under a sense of ... this past\nYes a that is what I'm saying [laughter] and um\nAnyway you know so it would give you a lot more flexibility now of course you might see I'm not gonna you know Richard spent all night talking about different dominoes it's possible people if it past people would do things in anticipation of a lobbying change and stuff like that but legally speaking nothing would change the first day\nRight so it's a it's not it's hard to predict or you can you predict what could happen if prop ten past ah if we don't quite if there's many steps that have to fall after that\nI don't um I don't think that's a predicting other than there would be a very lively conversation at the San Francisco board of supervisors and a couple of other cities um\nI don't think I Want to predict what would happen right away\nI'm not just because I'm being a cop out but you know a lot of investors and other people will kill on both sides will posture about what they say they're going to do if something happens and it's\nNot entirely clear if they were really do that things so um I don't think it's a good idea to get too deep into that because sometimes you're playing into people's you know\nPlaying to people who are trying to get you to vote one way or the other\nGot it okay this just a a chance for you to give our um our audience a a a an understanding of what this is about what happens if it passes I'm In immediately and and what could happen down the road um so and\nAt this point and one of the things we're going to talk about a lot over this hour is is whether um\nCosta Hawkins a has a impacted the ability for a more affordable housing\nTo be built uh in California um do you have any research you can point to that might point to that question or what might happen or if a rent control were to become um\nSomething that's become more widespread or less restricted\nSo there's going to be a lot of discussion hair and a lot of parsing of studies and when you go to a human read about this on line or wherever you will always be a lot of dueling studies\nUm\nPolitics is about a choice people have their choice now an economics is about cough and people can tally cough in perfectly but they do probably the best job or you know in perfectly\nI think that um when we're talking about this issue it might well be that some people hear what people have to say about um you know print control and I would very much does help tenants today a and they'll say you know what that's a\nThat's a that's a choice I Want to make\n'em but I think people should also be wary that there are cough and it might well be that those costs are totally acceptable to them as a voter\n'em and um it might be that they're not but the costs aren't free and so I think that you know and and you probably you're you can make a very strong argument that people need rent control now that we're in a crisis that needs to be expanded and that the costs are worth a\nFair point that some people will probably make some people would say the costs aren't worth it but I don't think you should listen to anyone who says there's no cos I'm the cops generally are that you're more or less\nUm so we have to bury accounts of where we pride ourselves on being data driven not dogma driven and the data is clear liquid fickle on unpaid shovel um rent control stops\nNew housing construction and actually goes a dozen more\nConnor correctly pointed out it creates winners and losers um the winters are existing tenants who who hit the jackpot and got the rent controlled apartment in the in the lottery\nBut but it also does is it discourages landlords for maintaining their their their properties so the overall quality of the housing stock goes dog um\nAnd then you get a lot of landlords particularly the smaller family mom and pop landlords who may have a few units I'm as their retirement income\nThey're much more likely and the and the data is as clear again on this to take those units off the market and sell them I'm a small mom and pop landlord does not want the rent board or you know coming visiting um uh they'd they'd they'd much rather not deal with that level of government\nUm when they're when they're with their talents so that you get last a rental stock overall the beneficiaries of that\nAre the people who can afford to buy\nSo it's ... it's the people at the bottom of the income ladder who suffer most when a particularly strict controls her past\nAnd that's I think not what we're trying to achieve here I think deeper and I are United on our our our intentions on our goals to help us solve this housing crisis in this affordability crisis I think we're just disagree that the ... the the solution to the problem I think it's a it's a medicine that could kill the patient\nSo uh first of all we don't really know what would happen after after day once it's interesting to if proposition ten pass it it it's interesting to hear how people might in this anecdote you shared a might already be responding to it as if I had already passed\nUm but um tell us more about how landlords look at a ... or developers look at\nUm a project or does or does rent control or is it just a no go as as you describe it or does it give people a chance to kind of know what they can expect since rent control tells them kind of what\nWhat they can and cannot do when they sat and and rent and how they can raise rents wouldn't that give 'em win that game developers some sense of what what could they could reap from their investment\nAt developing a properties and and housing is an incredibly risky undertaking and venture I'm On the front end a developer has to negotiate with a with a property owner for the value of the land purchased the land\nThen they have to run the gauntlet of getting the the project approved through multiple local a\nFlaming hoops um they have to negotiate with Labor Day after negotiate with suppliers they have to pay all of their contractors and as the project moves through the process quite often get sued 'em they have to negotiate with community groups for community benefits agreements impact fees\nAt ... at each step in the process value is taken out of the project and what's left at the end of the day at the ... is what the developer takes their um their the last person to eat at the table if you will and if they end the ... the government says we're going to impose on the front and\nAll of these incredibly high risky costs and on the back and we're going to cap any potential profits you can make\nOn the D investors are going to go elsewhere with their money investors always look for the highest return on their dollar and and this is this is just high wall street works they look for the highest return on the dollar and if you say you ... this we're capping potential profits on on rental housing they will build condos\nOr they will buy bitcoin or they will invest in Tesla they will do something other than than build rental housing and I think again that's not what we need at this at this time in our history\nQuestion before I let deep uh respond [noise] um what about deep was a proposal that\nAll new construction as soon as it's constructed it could be phased in over a number of years say Twenty years away Berkeley is proposing a wouldn't that be a way to kind of mitigate some of this chilling effect on development\nWell that's making the assumption that cities won't use rent control is just another tool to stop housing construction\nIf you look at our regional housing needs allocation numbers in the bay area for the past several cycles\nAre the vast majority of our cities have failed to meet those numbers um I spend way too many late evenings planning commission meetings and have done for over a decade I ... I go to city halls across the region and fight for more housing and I see a local elected as\nSome of them trying to do the right thing many of them trying to do the right thing but they are faced with incredible pressures by nimby groups to stop construction of new housing um they have zoning controls at their disposal to to stop new housing um\nIf you give them pricing controls and ... on top of zoning controls that that's that's a huge multiplier you can stop a project by saying no you're not allowed to build that type of project here or you can stop a project by saying you can only be charged X number of dollars knowing that the project will never pencil\nSo saying that we can you know cities are free to impose a ruling rent control that will be good for the developers that's assuming that cities actually want the housing and I I think that's a big assumption to make particularly when you look at the track record of a lot of our cities in terms of housing production\nIn case you're just joining us this is city visions on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and on the Web KLW dot org I'm just a ... and tonight we're diving into the pros and cons of the uh arguments are for and against the proposition attended that would be\nThe a repeal of the Costa Hawkins a um act\nThat was passed in Nineteen Ninety five that put some restrictions on on rent control in the state of California we heard at the beginning of our program for Conor Dougherty with the New York times are just now Matt Reagan the senior vice president of the bay area council who uh opposes prop ten and\nA ... a is also joining us the executive director of SF tendency and part of the yes on ten coalition we invite you to call in with your questions and comments should the ability to regulate rents be returned back to the local government and his rent control the ... right way to tackle the Affordable housing crisis\nThat we're currently in it seems like both sides agree on how will you be voting on prop ten we invite you to join our conversation by dialing eight six six seven nine eight talk that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can email us at city visions KLW done work post a comment on the ... website\nOr tweet us ... visions KLW also\nA department back to you hear ah when I'm Matt was just talking he says that the real problem is there's not enough housing and that uh lifting restrictions on rent control will only exacerbate the problem um how do you respond to that\nThink that's absolutely not true for several reasons first of all it's never happens that any rent controlled city in the nation has\nPlaced limits on buildings that are that have brand new um they've all had some sort of protections in ... when I got called protections they've all allowed landlords to set and developers to set rand's when they first constructive building and to be on and wreckage will say is that all have built more\nHousing and have built faster than non right controlled cities in California I'm In LA and San Francisco and Berkeley for example they all felt ... and and now it was a hundred and thirty six percent\nThey built more housing than neighboring areas that were not controlled in San Francisco it was over thirty percent\nThese housing is scare tactics in order to preserve profits and nothing more\n[noise] um\nSo this this conversation about um developers currently stopping projects not not not but building right now has to do with the fact that we're talking about potential instability in terms of what might happen and they're waiting to see how things fall out but\nWhen we talk about winners and losers we should think about the people who are really being harmed right now where the people who aren't sure if they're going to have a roof over their head next month this was a reality for Californians right now more and more\nHomeless families more and more people working more and more jobs deciding between food and rent deciding between medications and rent moving farther and farther away from their jobs driving to in three hours to get two jobs in places in the bay area for example I'm\nThe losers in than the current state of affairs are low income and middle income people and the winters are um of an unregulated market or the businesses that benefit from having no regulations on them and of course they are fighting regulations that always happens\nUm [noise] in terms of the\nConversation around mom and pop landlords\nSelling right now um there's a huge speculative market to buy up property from mom and pop landlords and more and more of those units are going into the hands of a large scale\nCorporate owners for example and those same companies are the biggest donors have been no one ten campaign companies like Blackstone um ethics properties um equity residential these are the companies that there's there's some of the biggest landlords and the entire country and I'm\nMuch of their portfolio of single family homes that they bought after the foreclosure crisis [noise] um and they are spending millions and millions of dollars to make sure that they're um portfolios won't be regulated\nComplex it is or sorry very old gross apartment complex that isn't particularly nice\nAnd then they clear everyone out and then they raised around a thousand bucks and maybe if you're lucky they painted em and a lot of people don't like that activity um in fact even economists don't like that activity they say they're the only uh [noise]\nThat the only use of that activity is quote price discovery um [laughter] which is a which is quite a way of putting it so there's a lot of ideas\nFor wanting to help renters now and ... ten is one of those ideas it's not a complete there are fairly conservative people who when they're feeling about you know\nA societal fabric and whatever else I'm ...\nYou want to impose some kind of price cap temporarily or whatever uh who who who don't think uh what I'm saying if you don't think the idea of capping rights as a horrible idea um but they don't think ... a good way of doing it so I guess I just try to keep in perspective\nWhat without like going back and forth about like this study this this study that um\nI think that it's important to keep in perspective that we do have two problems and California one is a long term problem that we don't want to make any worse\nBut the other is a short term problem that we seem to want to do something about and um you know anytime you have a mix of problems like that um you end up doing you know picking kind of\nOptions um you know meaning sometimes you pick a some degree of [noise]\nLike a price like I said it's like a price cap of ten percent or something like that so I just I just kind of want to try to say that there are even people who are you know economists or or who would be against prop tend who would be for some kind of price\nA cap of some kind and you know anyway I just think it's important to kind of keep in perspective that we do have a a reality on the ground that is a little bit more complicated than studies make it out to be um so\nShould so I Want to make sure to get our guests back in the studio back into the conversation but thanks for that Connor and one to make sure to put the phone number out again if you want to join our conversation tonight about prop ten which is ah about um\nRepealing a Costa Hawkins which uh would liberalize rent control uh or in cities across a California should it passed potentially regret raised the the ... I'm Sorry I Would\nUh a decrease restrictions on rent control a cross a California what actually happens remains to be seen a number down to join our conversation is eight six six seven eight talk again that's eight six six seven and eight eight to five five\nYou can email us at city visions and KLW dot org and post a comment on our Facebook page or let's actually go to a caller and I'm from San Francisco welcome to the program\nI I'm I'm calling because I was looking at information regarding prop pan and I didn't find an answer for it and that is\nRecording owner move in because I'm a public school teacher and my husband was a public school teacher and he worked three part time jobs so we could be bought some houses that he and my sons and I worked\nFor families we put out and we had we have teachers living\nAnd somehow this but we also have grandchildren now and as our children get owner older you know they may want to move and so I'd want from what I understand it would be almost prohibitively expensive if not impossible to do an owner moving down the line but I may be wrong\nSo that's my concern and aren't we deliberately went out and we didn't buy foreclosures we just worked hard you know weekends for years fixing up houses [noise]\nAnd ah we have all we have to in San Francisco and one in Oakland and um we rent to teachers and families specifically without gouging but\nIf it were true that we you know we've never been able to passes on to our children our grandchildren we might sell early so I just wanted to hear\nSomeone off thanks so much call yeah go ahead\nI I can answer that question um prop ten has nothing to do with the owner move in laws in San Francisco or anywhere in the state it simply has to do with rent controlled it would have no impact on your decision or your choice to um move it yourself or a family member into a unit that you own\nAll right so ah let's ah this issue of what happens when um [noise]\nA renter leaves I'm so vacancy control which is kind of a hard concept to get your head around but my understanding if I get it right is with Costa Hawkins in place now I'm a\nVacancy control is prohibited which means that a landlord can raise the rent to the market rate once a a tenant moved out or if a prompt and passes and cost Hawkins is repealed that restriction would be removed and theoretically it would take cities\nUm some doing to actually allow um I'm a two to prohibit rent or uh landlords to a raise runs to the market rate it wouldn't just happen on the day after the election um why a ... is this such an important piece of uh of this a proposition\nIt's so important because um we talked about\nHow\nExpensive it is to move into a new unit today and how every unit as it goes back to market rate um [noise] I talked to a tenant today I'm In my office who moved into his unit he's a trans man in San Francisco moved into his unit Twenty years ago\nWith his partner his partner passed away a few months ago and his partner was a tenant the original ten in the middle east and he moved in with the permission of the landlord but he was not the original occupant [noise]\nUm at that point the landlord raise the rent seven times what he's originally been um and he came to the tendency union on the same day that he wants to ...\nUm for um his partner and we had to give them the bad news that we don't have the ability to\nThat that that run to increase is legal and there's nothing we can do because he's not on beliefs um because he's not the original occupy the language is in costs talking about the original occupants okay I'm In New York a tennis have that kind of protection family members\nHousehold members who um have that kind of protection if they've been in a unit for more than two years\nUm and if they've lived with that family member for some time and we see this kind of heartbreaking story every week that's the most extreme example but of course\nThere's also the examples of any situation in which attendance is in their place for a long time I'm as their rent is less at lower and lower the market there's more and more pressure to push that tenants out and that is\nHe's a prisoner perverse scenario in which um landlords take worse and worse care of 'em they they treat\nLonger term tenants worse and worse longer term tenants are more and more afraid to speak up about their rights and um\nLandlords target them for harassment we've seen that in particular with one of the big corporate owners I'm ... I'm In San Francisco that's now the biggest um owner of the biggest lower in San Francisco with over ten thousand units in their portfolio which is there a test they um will buy a building\nThey will pass through a number of pass which pass throughs of course are fine if a landlord has cost that exceed what their um\nIf they make a bunch of her parents and and on alterations to a building the improvements they should be able to pass those costs through\n'em but they do that and then they they pass it costs only onto the longest term tenants with the hope that some of those tenants leave I Will not be able to afford those costs and then they can flip a certain number of units in their loan documents they actually demonstrate um that they're\nThat they and they expect a certain amount of turnover\nI'm ... I'm going to market rate and then they borrow money to fight the finance the purchase of these buildings with the intent of flipping a certain number of units which means in real um and we'll terms it means people losing their homes people losing that's that's the ability of their lives people living in in this economy people being pushed out of the city\nSo Matt wanting to have you you're not here necessarily representing landlords are but uh but this idea of a Costa Hawkins creating these perverse incentives uh that then lead to situations where rent skit or jacked up on long term tenants who\nBy technicality that could still happen um or with a as a um as properties change hands are new people come in with the intent to really move some long term tenants out of so that they can raise the rent because vacancy controls are prohibited um what do you well how do you respond to that\nI I Do agree with you one hundred percent the ... of market controls price controls um any kind of distortions do create perverse incentives I'm On the analogy I like to use is you know we a generation ago we pass prop Thirteen in California and", "show_name": "City Visions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23"}
