A. L. W. dot org [noise]\nWell I thought to start the conversation we really need to understand the underlying law which is called Senate bill number one I'm Martin can you explain how that law came about and what it does\nYes the gasoline tax is an excise tax which is ... cents per gallon not as a percentage of the sale price\nSo the legislature has to raise the tax every now and then in order for it to keep up with inflation\nAnd then on top of that I'm with vehicle fuel efficiency increasing in order to raise enough money or the facts has to get higher in order to produce the same amount of revenue that it did when when vehicles got ten or twelve or Fifteen miles per gallon and now they get forty miles per gallon\nSo the tax has to be higher to to view as much as it used to per mile of driving so periodically the legislature has raised attack but recently it hadn't been for many years\nAnd so the buying power of the revenue had declined and there was a backlog of um mostly maintenance projects would also new capital investment so in the spring of twenty Seventeen the legislature exit is raised\nA in sb won it raised the base\nOf gasoline excise tax raised the diesel fuel tax it added to our\nVehicle registration fees of of between twenty five and a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nA per vehicle depending on the value of the vehicle and for the very first time it added a fee on electric vehicles which of course pay no gas ... packs\nAt all and so it added a modest fee of a hundred dollars a year on electric vehicles as a first step I think toward trying to be fair in charging electric vehicles as long a alongside a gasoline powered vehicles\nAnd Carl this um says Senate bill one has been around for a year what has it funded so far\nThank you again for having me on the show You're welcome so for the Senate bill one has moved forward with six\nYeah eight of California's county's four hundred and eighty one of four hundred and eighty two cities and there's a price for anyone who can save the city that has not yet drawn on that\nNow I'm curious for\nJones says ... county Caucasian eight hundred and thirty nine and they will they just have not yet applied for their funds with eight hundred and thirty nine residents\nCould hide from his if you're listening and ... it used to call in [laughter]\nIf you're if you're single goes to ... more power to you so where did the funds go it's as Dr rocks said it generates about five point two billion dollars a year at one point nine billion of that grace we'll go for\nA hour highway system fifty one thousand nine hundred\nState highway lane miles Thirteen thousand state bridges sixteen hundred of our bridges are an unsafe in deficient conditions one point eight billion will go for our local streets in roads we have three hundred and five thousand\nLocal street and rode ... miles in another twelve thousand bridges in over crossing so seven out of every ten dollars will make sure that our roads are safer\nAnd in better condition for our motorists\nThe remaining three out of ten seven hundred and fifty million goes for transit improvements especially in urban areas like ours that depend on it\nI think the bart extension into San jose in downtown Santa Clara electrifying and modernize in modernizing Cal trained commuter rail service the smart train for those of us who enjoy going up to the wind a country and snow member in Area Rapid transit\nA hundred miles for those a hundred million a year for those of us who prefer to wheels to four wheels\nMost of my commute by bicycle Seventeen miles each way each day and so we want to get more people out of their cars and burning burning a a burning cards rather than carbon so a hundred million a year of that five point two billion his first\nIs for bike safety pedestrian safety safe routes to school for my little girl's et cetera uh and that\nCovers almost all of it for for a a vehicles in our parks and rec system there is a modest amount there for agriculture vehicles there is a modest amount there for those tow trucks you see on bay area freeways and tried to move traffic jams by pulling people off of our freeways and local streets in roads\nThere is a modest amount of about twenty five million a year there a doctor walks in his expertise or I Believe at UCLA will know there's about five million or seven million a year or two words I think four or five universities two words are indeed in transportation improvements\nIn together as a package\nThat is what SP one provided again through the California transportation commission and Caltrans sixty five hundred\nProjects have already been approved in are moving forward in those categories\nI felt a lot of that's a lot of projects I mean why that particular proposition should be passed and why and it sounds like a lot of infrastructure needs that are being attacked the south and what what are the objections to have you on that and working\n... jumping off of what some of the point to colleges made a lot of the things that you described are desirable projects for our infrastructure our infrastructure in California is woefully inadequate in many ways the problem is\nThat first of all only a third of the funds that have been raised so far being budgeted and allocated towards Cal transfer the core purpose for which this tax\nWas advertised SBY namely our highways are bridges are crumbling infrastructure a lot of that money is instead being used for social engineering projects like bike lanes and made it very nice to hear Carl talk about riding to work on a bicycle\nLuxurious for wealthy people and a lot of people who work here in the bay area actually have to commute two hours from their homes and more affordable areas to get to work and for them there is no bicycle riding to get to work there is no weekend\nTime to go on the line train they actually have a huge impact to their economic situation from the approximately Seventeen Eighteen hundred\nDollars that is imposed on a two car household to pay for this gas tax increase and so when you add up the amount of money out of pocket it's about Fifteen hundred dollars gross set up with the taxes at a lower income tax rate of two thousand dollars that's two years' worth of\nA Christmas presents for a family of four that looks that's a lot of other necessities of life and so this tax is the most popular aggressive possible attacks and that's the objection to it so\nUh it's an unfair tax it imposes a huge burden on the people who couldn't put a cooking afforded beliefs secondly the problem in California is that all of these types of well intentioned taxes that raise money for a specific purpose\nThey get raided by the legislature for other purposes and we've seen that happen with prior gas taxes and prior taxes in bonds that are allocated for improvement of our infrastructure so\nCarl is the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley leadership group a public policy trade association and a member of the California transportation commission we all have harm me Dylan a trial lawyer and former candidate for assembly and a Republican National committee member and\nOn the phone have Dr Martin lax Martin is a former director of the UC transportation center and the department chair of the department of planning at UCLA\nWe invite you to call in with your questions and your comments what do you think the states\nPlease call in at eight six six seven eight talk again that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five or you can email us now is the vision that KLW dot org or post a comment on ... KLW dot org or a Facebook page you can also find us on Twitter at sea visions KLW\nI mean I wanted to turn to you when it comes to the editorial boards of the state wide newspapers\nVery few I think the only the Orange County registrars in favor of proposition sex and the overwhelming um the sentiment of the editorial board to vote no on prop sex and largely that's because it seems like the Senate bill one that has been effective in um funding in important unnecessary transportation needs what do you say about that\nWell I'm sure we would have very efficient funding if we tax people at a hundred percent too but that's not really how it works out of the problem is that a lot of the voices in California who are most impacted by these massive tax increases at every level and they include\nFrom I'm from nimby attitudes to housing that really complicates is transportation issue in California to these transportation\nUh taxes to employment taxes to sales taxes and income taxes\nThose people have left California and fewer and fewer people are reading those newspapers that are saying yes please continue to raise the taxes because because that's how they vote on just about everything they want more money for the government to spend on various things but\nI don't know how you can have an intelligent conversation about this tax in any tax involving transportation without looking at the gross and efficiency of ...\nI'm a reason magazine and other studies have shown that\nThe the cost of doing a mile of road here in California and maintaining and improving it\nIs four point seven times what it is and other states it's a four hundred and Seventy percent inefficiency how can you not talk about that we have tons of people uh Caltrans who don't have enough work to do every day a lot of the money that we raise for these types of projects and why so many lobbyists and so much money are behind this\nOr for a union you know unions need workers to work on these projects and a filled our coffers and again\nThe you know I have you want to get emotional anecdotes I can give you the names of dozens of people who've left California because this was one too many taxes and on top of that this tax if it was so great\nWhy did a democratic leaders have to wanna one by one bribe various Democrats and vulnerable districts and mix districts to vote for it with\nA half a million dollars here and a hundred million dollars there so uh this kind of dirty way that this thing was passed in the first places of the reason why so many taxpayers are so angry about and why it needs to be repealed\nWell let's talk about is it more expensive to repair roads in California than elsewhere Karl\nRove you ask a different question about editorial boards and I'm not sure that was answered so let me start there and then I'll go to your second question grace because both are fair\nThe truth of the matter is that every bay area newspaper every single one that has taken a position on proposition six has been\nAdamant in its opposition to proposition six months for so for reasons but let me just mention a handful of those papers the room independent journalist Santa Rosa press Democrat to San Francisco chronicle the Petaluma argues courier the East Bay times from San jose Mercury News the San Francisco business times from Santa Cruz sentinel\nEvery single bay area paper it's opined ... an opposition and why is that it's how dangerous in cynical this measure is and the impact\nThat it will have in destroying our transportation system and when we dive into\nThat the LA Times calls this the ...\nWorse or the cynical motives behind proposition six\nCalled political ploy the only reason this is on the ballot is to give anti tax Republicans a reason to go to the polls\nParty bosses are hoping that while we're there there they'll vote for conservative candidate Santa Rosa press Democrat ... say cynical approach the chronicle a cynical political ploy that would destroy California's roads grace let me remind your listeners how this got on the ballot\nThe signatures were collected because the national Republican Party in GOP leaders including the speaker of the house GOP leader of Paul Ryan of Wisconsin\nHis superPAC helped funded Steves the least the majority whip from Louisiana and his superPAC funded it Kevin McCarthy majority leader three hundred thousand for this six\nRepublican congressional candidates at risk funded it because they see this as a way to keep the house of representatives why are papers so against it and the dish and not the politics which are not appropriate\nBut the policy it's the cost of bad roads in traffic to San Luis Obispo Tribune bad roads cost the average San Luis Obispo resident almost twice of what it costs the average California resident of one thousand four hundred and Nineteen year in maintenance and repair and lost fuel efficiency\nSan Francisco chronicle similar California's roads are ranked as some of the worst in the country I thought are dangerous thing to harm me said that she she was concerned at first it only a third of these funds go to Caltrans that as Dr ... confirmed two thirds go to\nOur localities they go to the cities and counties for those street maintenance and pothole repair fountains so after lamenting that only a third goes to Caltrans she'd done at tax Caltrans is grossly in the\nFall I don't want I don't want that hell at all I don't want the bill at all I I don't think that another tiny should go to Caltrans until the discipline that fact that if we actually spent the money that's already ... for these purposes on these laudable goal as having passable roads in California\nWe didn't need this tax so that's the problem well I'm just curious ... original question is that mark spent ... I'm\nSo hard and he does is quoting an organization called the reason foundation who's still hasn't said where they got the funds for their study where they said that it was more expensive to repair roads in California so let's look at that closely for a moment\nThey didn't say lane miles they said lanes\nSo in California we have highways that are three four five lanes in each direction pick Arkansas one or two lanes in each direction and they counted miles not lane miles seconds we are blessed to axe to be the import hub for twenty percent\nOf all the imports coming into the United states those going trucks mainly but also in rail cars\nAnd they beat up our roads a lot more that they do in states like Arkansas\nAnd as I'm sure ... confirmed or tell me if I'm wrong on this but those are the reasons we're data matters over dogma\nYou have to count all the lane miles not just the lanes and you have to remember what's going on on those roads so that's why three hundred and Seventy five million a year of this five point two billion are for those freight court orders think eight eighty five eighty six eighty and others where\nPeople may say it's dramatic but when people are almost losing their lives or losing their lives on our roads in part because of the conditions ... the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration twenty sixteen day that we lost thirty six hundred and twenty seven\nAccording to mix the based on the conditions of our roads those aren't sob stories those are human lives\nBut we have a full phone line so let's go to one of our listeners I'm Lisa end salon a county\nHi my name is Lisa I'm a nurse and I'm I'm less you know that represents the Latino community and I'm very disappointed I feel that his top is on the ballot because we should've been given a choice\nAs hot fairs and everybody that voted to vote and we didn't we didn't have the\nAh we couldn't because it was put through through legislation and I have to tell you that they're going to affect everybody it doesn't matter if you're Democrats independence or Republican every one of us can be as most of us too because we can't live in the bay area so we live outside\nThe bay area my husband and I we both can use every single day at least Ninety miles each\nBack and forth so it's going to cost way more than the eight hundred that you said it's going to be more like the two thousand which we calculated with everything else not only that it is that the farmers we have a lot of farmers up in northern California and in order for them to get their produce out\nIt's going to cost them more that means is going to cost more I guess what that means they're going to be taught and I feel if we don't vote yes five six till we feel the gas tax what's going to happen as a legislator things\nThey'll just say to think that they're going to be able to have our phone our water and they're going to go off the top Thirteen which protects our homes and um\nThis is on the ballot because it should be on the ballot it shouldn't be on the ballot but it is because you didn't give us the choice you didn't give us a choice to make a decision and vote\nHockey economy in or help the economy in terms of imports from around the world that is why we need to use phones\nWell thank you for that this is the city of our local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco on the Web that KLW dot org tonight we're debating the pros and cons of a proposition six with our guests Karl card you know the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley leadership group harm me Dylan trial lawyer and former candidate for the assembly\nAnd Martin lacks a former director of the UC transportation center at the department chair of the UCLA department of planning\nWe invite you to call in with your questions or comments what do you think of ... sex and and feel free to give us a call at eight six six seven eight talk Martin would you like to comment on Carl's last I'm no comment\nI I wanted to add one point or more to what a cold\nWar you know that he he said I can correct him if he was wrong and I do\nNot correct them because he was not wrong in fact I did the calculations myself as to what the gas tax from Nineteen twenty three would be and it came up with exactly the same results so um he would not run but there's one more point I Would make this rainy day fund would\nCover about two years of revenue the card balance would cover about two years of revenue that would be produced by sb one\nUm and the problem is that that's general revenue so it\nIs available to be spent on for example a firefighting as we've had some very serious fire a forest fires in California and\nBrush fires and it's also available for use for education and health care and those are important programs and transportation would have to compete to get a share of that so that the\nTotal balances only two years of the proceeds of revenue but we would get from the gas tax of program and um the the the gas tax is guaranteed by\nState law and by article Nineteen of the constitution of California to be spent on transportation so again if you're if you're planning projects that have\nA better in the pipeline but for seven and eight and ten years before they're open to traffic\nRelent as being purchased and construction is under way it's important to know that there that the gas tax stable source of revenue and the rainy day fund is one for which there would have to be competition each year and the portion that would go to transportation cannot be specified in it that\nWe have an email for thank you for that Martin and we have an email from Ian in San Francisco please have your gas clarified ms Dylan statement in which he represented the actual costs to families as attacks\nAs opposed to the fact that it is the cost and excessive wear and tear if the tax does not pass currently California drivers spend up to seven hundred and thirty nine dollars per year on front end alignment shocks entire repairs\nBecause of driving on bad roads facts matter um [noise]\nWhat do you do what I Would say is nobody here in this conversation is saying that we shouldn't fix the roads and we shouldn't have good roads the problem is that we already have taxes in California to address these issues and if we impose discipline around them\nWe wouldn't be talking about raiding the rainy day fund or any of that nobody is suggesting that here I don't think that's just the responsible\nBut I think that what's fiscally irresponsible is to\nAllow this bait and switch and raise money repeatedly for different purposes\nWhen you add up all the different taxes and fees in our gas costs it's actually Ninety five point five cents a gallon there all kinds of fees that relate to environmental issues and other issues like that Californians already paid the second highest gas taxes in the country after Hawaii Hawaii is number one and after that it's California\nDo we add the second best roads in the country\nResponsible way of handling our problems and I I personally as a taxpayer I don't see a problem and using general revenue funds for general obligations in our state because when we do that and we have to weigh competing interest against each other as opposed to thinking this is some kind of bottomless pit they can keep taxing people more and more and more\n[noise] we have a caller Tony from San Francisco\nHi um I it's so funny I was in his show and I was actually commuting home from work from rockstar I live in a fight forest hills in San Francisco and I have to drive by ... ... over the Golden Gate bridge\nEt cetera et cetera and nineteenth avenue and it is unbelievable how bad the roadside\nAnd what I see it you know the answers and both of those I get the email said that what I Know this is the his management of fire\nAnd outsourcing the contracts that they didn't like taking the lowest I contract at least in San Francisco you will see I thought that if they got this one road it shaped though three times\nAnd like for my and it's just you know I Know the money's going away because I really think that that needs to be done is\nLike an overhaul of how the Pfizer being fat because\nEspecially if the money's there I mean I'm In favor of increasing the cat that found but then to cut out people with electric cars they already get the you know the ... and that's your guest said that you have to make the most money to buy an electric car I Can't eat or glass\nThanks for your call Tony appreciate that ... what do you say that that that the way the funds are being is it's not efficient and how can we make sure that any money that's raised for transportation gets used wisely and that I rented do get to be in better shape yeah\nIn Tony thank you for calling safe travels home from San Francisco to to lurk spur\nA in remembered let's talk about your prep six passes what would that mean to your commute I already mentioned the traffic this taken off the road it's not a wind train it as a commuter train called smart ... Area Rapid transit and it takes commuter\nCars off of highway one on one this would also take away the money to fix the murder in Sonoma narrows and you probably know that road very well Tony it's where\nHighway one ... one goes from three lanes to two lanes and then mysteriously back to three again well that's one of the sixty five hundred projects that\nSenate bill one is funding the propositions six wants to take away and if we take it away we're not going to be able to build that lane because dollars are finite it's math and we need to recognize that and I'm Glad you brought up electric cars and you're right that is why in in their wisdom\nAs grace mentioned earlier and as Dr Iraq's mentioned earlier the electric cars are now paying it's it's a hundred dollars a year starting in twenty twenty plus they paid the transportation improvements the and as you noted you and I can't afford an electric car\nMy car again nine years old previous with Ninety eight thousand miles on it\nBlue Book value of six thousand I'll pay fifty dollars a year Ninety percent of the cars would either pay the twenty five dollars a year or the fifty dollars a year based on our uh depreciated value of our car so a brand new electric car of sixty thousand than up\nThey pay not only the hundred for the electric vehicle but another hundred and Seventy five for the transportation improvements the they're actually paying more than\n... would be paying through this and again as you mentioned on the phone Tony or they was the previous caller before you seven hundred and thirty nine dollars is what we pay is an average motorists\nIn fuel inefficiency because the beat up roads shocks alignment entire damage and Marty Dr ... again we'd never met your the expert if I got a new that wrong call me on a\nCell that can I add a point about this uh you know Tony mentioned the inefficiency at the spending of our resources let's just talk about to bay area projects I mean we have the\nUh the trans bay terminal which is a shut down because the boats are cracking because somebody didn't do a good job of designing that particular transportation hub which is one of these projects that this money gets spent on\nAnother example here in the bay area is our\nUh I think twice over budget Willie Brown a span of the bay bridge which again made a defective foreign boats and not money well spent for the taxpayer\nBecause this money as a bottomless pit that legislators in Sacramento or out of touch with are people who actually have to commute and work for a living um have to suffer through\nThey think it's a bottomless pit they can keep coming back to the well attacks us more and more they don't realize that the killing that goes that lays the golden egg workers like those who have called in today are leading our state for places where the taxes are lower the roads are better the legislators are more sensitive to the needs of the working\nPerson and when and again remember the tax today after this increase the first tax in nearly a ... that the first gas tax increase in California nearly a quarter of a century\nSince a Republican governor George Duke mange you lead the effort for our last increase in the early Nineteen nineties but didn't adjusted for inflation is the same amount as it was when the gas tax started in January leaving\nOut all the ... of Carly ... Ninety five point five percent ... percent Ninety five point five cents out of every gallon and you're not even talking about one in ... and he talks about getting my ... so there's also an increase the cost of food", "show_name": "City Visions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
