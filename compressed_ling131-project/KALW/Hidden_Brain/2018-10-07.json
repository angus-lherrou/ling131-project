I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and debt [noise]\nIt's the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions so pay attention to your own Randy is now in her late thirties [noise] a few years ago her life unraveled [noise] or the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility she being with a company that ran\nIt for more than a decade one day she made a mistake\nHome that was our because daycare closer to six I get off at\nIt was like maybe a\nTen mile drive busy traffic area and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up before the baby up\nAround new stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she's white took credit card at the self checkout station and reached out to\nIt turns out she used the wrong card\nNot her own by the company credit card\nWhat's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment\nI didn't realize until my supervisor column in and said hey what's this purchase\nHad she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRandy carry the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies for what she never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well you\nKnow we have to terminate you\nAnd I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nAs this crime and crime and like all day because I couldn't\nBelieve that I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what an Avon I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though it was a mistake\nBrandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting she had supported him when he'd be laid off a few years earlier and treat expected\nHe'd do the same for her\nBut he felt he situation was different\nHe'd been laid off Randy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to chat interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't purpose toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper when I came in with the kids who just immediate started yelling\nYou can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right back out the door and I never looked back\nWithout steady employment and her husband to help with bills Randy watching anxiously as her household supplies dwindled she worried constantly about money [noise] to make ends meet shorter than your credit card the date arrived ground detour\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two cards will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things you're paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework dilemma of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation\nFalter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people do voice the aqua conversationalist [noise] and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves and scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you were in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable that it's the it's un\nI tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same as like the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading house theory to excused irresponsible behavior and down in San Diego wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they are poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who\nSpent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually look or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn some days that we get to leave at four pm Sunday's we'd only tell why am I [laughter] and then you usually start the next day or night thirty or six in the morning usually work\nEighty hours a week\nWe'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nThe Proud Boys think feminism went too far and it's bad for men and women\nThe feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five I think if women have their head screwed on properly

desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing it's time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief let me tell you the story of a young woman\nReasons that will be clear in a moment for as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards if there was a holiday party I brought the note cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started a residency the new schedule was grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patience and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and\nChecking on their plan and adjust medications et cetera is necessary and then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on Sundays we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise]\nUm and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nAs Judy's workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nWalking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working [noise] Fifteen hours a day and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success Judy lost sight of things on the periphery [noise]\nShe didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity [noise] in her case it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time\nSo I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me out [laughter] it was just a mess and um [noise] I've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and\nComing home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of I think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from\nAll the things they hadn't done but I also forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of this\nWhat did you forget to do were melted if we're going to be [noise] um it was my energy bill the deal kid he would have spotted honest I mean you would just basic kid despite almost falling apart at Johnson I was I was falling apart\nThere was something else Katie had battled anorexia as a teenager she knew she had to stay vigilant about eating\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity [noise]\nIt turns out that having too much\nYou can have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you to breed the kind of suspicion why are you being nice to me are you just trying to give me give you something\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain [noise] this\nIs NPR\nMC five stars Wayne frame or has been a rock and roll legend and he's

rich\nTaking all of her for a detox and the Hampton standardized testing hasn't really stressed and\nMy farmer private jets your island a state of the Caribbean rich I mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise]\nBut if you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the liver wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of that clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\n... welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kinds of issues there bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of ... also calls for a certain psychological make up about what kind of person becomes a wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that summer\nProvide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy\nTo pay ... there are sometimes a client's do make requests like this not because they're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand scientists smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon\nAnd David said no I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish and the client later told him I basically made up\nThat story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich a very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\nBut but wells you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids\nWill last a wealth manager to break some bad news to the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family\nThe big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues the lawsuit process in many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets\nGuest today is a sociologist broke\nShe spent years trying to understand the lives of people who are still hoping that they're able to circumvent the constraints of national laws and borders in the course of her many interviews with wealth managers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "07"}
