through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency just kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the white\nHouse [noise] there's only one part in that finally we're not a politician\nSpring washer\nAnd often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has to be loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump's himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations and one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain this\nIs a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical\nRace as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJune Williams studies gender class and work in the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author of the book white working class overcoming class clueless miss in America Joan welcome to hit and bright\nDelighted to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars\nThat's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century or what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy\n[noise] since Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolutely tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all\nBut today it's less than half and this is the group whose economic prospects has really collapsed\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... ... she was very angry when the ... she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug\nSex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nJones as working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them\nWhen her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Joan suggested to her mother in law that you apply for somehow\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption\nKnow it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elite to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is it the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not how's it going to be people who are burning\nUndone or Shanghai but they're also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to that community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who will cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there is that it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThe twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for brags it and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity\nIn contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange said your husband had way of his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family\nUm so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of ... of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it\nIn order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nOn elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a\nTechie I'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many roasted do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\n[noise] going to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky too\nThere's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical school record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family\n... kid has to actually be about three times as good as a delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researchers sent out to satchel resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off um blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo got sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSay you may go through all of this process encourage all of\nThis debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJoan Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working class tip the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\n... ... ...\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain this is NPR\nWhat if you were sent to Iraq to guard Saddam Hussein\nDid you become his friend could you care about him that's\nNot

O T providing a software platform that enables organizations to deploy artificial intelligence predictive analytics and Iowa chief illusions an industrial scale\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small\nShare of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are a burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political track\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of these policies posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nRapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a six\nBeing more responsive to the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message in theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration\nThat can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states judge to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the eye of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and the our analysis is that from all these different angles not just of you know I'm\nCool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor and all of these different a political outcomes that we were exploring and so\nI think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today [noise]\n[noise]\nWhen we come back what ... opera hunters thesis about a white backlash means for politics and

Smith says that Trump was in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individuals\nThat pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration also tied in with the issue of race and this is why\nThe subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... it'd be at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have\nEight years of the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with at the specific campaign message of immigration a altogether tongue in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years\nI think it just is what galvanized his campaign and his presidency\nSo one one disturbing implication from your thesis Morris says heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political divide become racial divide\nIndeed and that that I one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really\nYou know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting tension\nHere it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to there was some time earlier but what might be in the interest of each party in the short term might not be\nAn interest in the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party and the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think their senses well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond\nTwenty Thirty years from now on the other hand the problem that Democrats faced as yes they're the most diverse party that more diverse than Republicans but one thing that they really are struggling with is that the voting behavior of voters of color different is a sense", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "28"}
