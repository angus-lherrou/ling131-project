conservative\nI Want you to jazz which is rich\nRules stress [noise]\nResearchers on them respect [noise]\nIt would be a very rural space educational system\nHow this would be fairly similar alarms would be a very nicely capturing a brain and most of the town of require us with lots of churches that's down one\nVery natural kinds of things rather than than real memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches and that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today refer to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeply those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me about how\nScience proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscures something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he\nHas spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you\nWhen most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that\nTheory go well\nWhenever asked my students were their political views come from the first thing I say as our parents\nAnd I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member a trusted relative\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order I think this is really at the core of of who we are and at the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place than\nWe\nAre now there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electoral journal activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of seeing if somebody's just having a reaction having\nA physiological arousal to that a stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative that is true then uh\nEarns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did that goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a picture of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century tree would be active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rocky now goes right through their foot you're some at a center to it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation medicines for two and conservative doesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted\nUh just means that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is Carl ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns to John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans\nIf you fall into a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin parents raised in the same household\nEach ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAt fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver\nI asked John what some studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data sets a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda ... have\nNot long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that their political views were quite heritable\n[noise] um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent of our political views or come from a genetic but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component\nIs not zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you\nMatt ... element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nOr heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of designed personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we're able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked to me about that idea\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like hand enough you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out uh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological\nThis is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics\nIf we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country\nBetween liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats I think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nI'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you for bait on but it's basically that a division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological\nA newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John ... he's the co author of the book predispose liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain [noise] thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nSlavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness in the question\nIs do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers but yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually\nWilling to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of that the all ... it may be that history will show\nIn the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's this sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family he writes a family we have every family people fight they quarrel they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict convict the family part [noise]\nMara see what tested again when we come back the political upheavals are the Nineteen sixties\nAnd ... echoes today [noise]\nYou're listening to

Rosen knew\nOne hundred years later\nAlive but the ... river by the ...\nAnd again when you think about some of the other leaders of the time there were certainly people who were advocating some portion of what the south was saying and eight teams you on there were people who are saying look the system is so broken it is sold\nFaulty that there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly well made which is that king wrapped himself in the flack you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the cockpit productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them\nMm Mm Mm\nI think we need to remember American democracy is\nFar from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and his generated tremendous progress economic progress social progress political a lot slower than we'd all like by voice things can go very badly and we all know that and so the question is can you continue to make progress [noise]\nSo which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United states are we on the brink of a new chapter in democracy\nOr on the brink of divorce\nI asked David about a number of more recent developments that rates troubling signals about the health of our tomorrow\n[noise]\nBecause I think this is a rock Obama's birth certificate Harris had people looking into your articles in front of the magnitude of costume prices\nThat show were actually killed Israeli attempt for casual their team lost [noise]\nHow these modern conflicts business as usual\nOrange something changed I think both I mean it depends what you want the comparison to be I think that relative to much of the twentieth century we've been more person more and more partisan today than in a long time but I have to say if you look", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
