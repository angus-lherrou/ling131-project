to counter spend your weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson\nThis week on counter spin Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell tip day poorly hidden hand by saying that we're it you know up to him\nCongress after the election could be looking to address Social Security Medicare and Medicaid which he called the real drivers of the debt\nMedia were quick to report Democrats outcry but that didn't include any questioning of media's own role in laying the groundwork for claims that Social Security is a controversial or a troubled program in need of addressing\nWe'll go over some myths about Social Security once more with feeling with Nancy Altman president of Social Security works board chair at the pension right center and author of among other titles the battle for Social Security firm FDR's vision to Bush's gamble\nThat's coming up but first we'll take a look back at mainstream press\nMore information about Washington Post columnist ... praise and murder at the hands of the Saudi Government comes to light fare analyst Adam Johnson called detention\nTo prop up the mythology of the U.S as a noble protector of democracy and human rights despite wars of aggression spy regimes the funding and arming of right wing militias and the propping up of dictators\nAnd that's the idea that the U.S political class does bad things not because bad things serve us imperial interests but because they are corrupted by sinister foreign actors\nIn a report on why show gays killing was unlikely to fundamentally altered the U.S Saudi relationship\nNBC News on October seventeenth explained that quote Adam Google and Middle East researcher with human rights watch said the longstanding economic and security ties with Saudi Arabia has forced us to tolerate a lot of questionable Saudi behavior close quote\nIt's unclear if those were Google's words or those of NBC reporters but you're left with the same idea due to economic and security ties somehow out of control the\nMost powerful country in the world is forced to tolerate\nWhat's called questionable behavior a phrase that sweeps together the destruction of Yemen which the U.S tolerates with material support including weapons and targeting instructions the heading of dissidents the disappearing of women drivers and the brutal murder of cars showcase\nThe theme was echoed at vox where readers learned that quote the realities of Cold War politics got us involved in a deep long term cooperation with the Saudi state that is not otherwise unnatural partner for the United states close quote\nNever mind that the U.S Saudi partnership predates the Cold War by about Fifteen Years Johnson writes the idea that dictators or sectarian regimes in the Mid East aren't natural partners of the U.S is simply fiction\nIt's refreshing that some are starting to challenge the United states grotesque alliance with the ... monarchy but with this should come questioning of the reassuring narrative\nThat the Saudis have corrupted plead or captured and otherwise benevolent values base to US government\nSadly but historically the u._s. hasn't embraced despotic regimes despite their oppressive nature but because of it [noise]\nUSA today's October twenty fifth front page headline read is the second amendment under fire in the west the online headline gun rights under siege was no less dramatic\nBefore going on to explain the actual subject of the story recreational shooting on public lands in West has officials struggling to balance sport verses safety [noise]\nSo yes the story has nothing to do with the right to bear arms whether that means participation in a militia the Supreme Court's traditional interpretation or a private right to own firearms as a two thousand eight ruling written by Antonin Scalia reinterpreted\nThe word Second Amendment don't appear in the body of the USA Today piece\nBecause the bill of rights isn't relevant to the topic at hand which is that quote all across the west federal and state land managers are struggling to balance the demands of recreational shooters with the fear that their bullets are starting fires\nFrightening other land users and accidentally killing others close quote nothing and the second amendment suggests that\nWhich is presumably wire reporter Trevor Hughes doesn't refer to it but editors who writes headlines maybe thought safety concerns wouldn't drive as many clicks as a culture war bit about gun rights\nDespite the fact that the people most likely to get excited about such headlines are also likely to take phrases like under fire and under siege rather literally\nAnd finally the New York times released news that the department of health and Human Services is speaking to force government agencies charged with enforcing civil rights law to adopt a definition of sex as\nEither a male or female an changeable and determined by the genitals that a person is born with with any dispute to be clarified using

R. dot news this policy change was enabled by media accounts that frame transgender issues as a debate\nEven though we're losing means the loss of human rights for trans people\nFor me burns wrote

about the ability of trans people to obtain identification that doesn't disclose their medical history\nAuthor and law professor dean spade and a piece for truth out ads that quote when trans phobia gets bolstered by signals from the federal government low level enforcers of gender norms feel even more license to humiliate and exclude trans people close quote\nAnd this means things like having welfare benefits terminated as a trans woman did when she showed up at her mandatory workfare assignment because the supervisor mark tourists absent saying she wasn't work ready if she dressed as a woman\nOr being denied placement in domestic violence shelters are in drug treatment programs because of the way gender markers are recorded on IDs and used to divide folks up and sex segregated facilities\nIt matters more for the disproportionate number of trans people who are poor and of color who survival is more likely at the mercy of bureaucrats and low level staff in prisons hospitals in group homes who make decisions about gender\nSpade says we need to see this White House attack as part of a broader and terrifying approach to race gender and authority\nSo while you knew what the New York times was getting at with their October twenty first headline transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nGiven what's at stake a less artful and more straightforward shorthand Trump plans to encourage abused and discrimination against transgender people might have been more appropriate [noise] you're listening to counter spin brought to each week by the media watch groups fair\nAn article and affairs magazine extra about mainstream media distortions on Social Security\nSite say New York times article that describes the federal budget deficit as quote overwhelmingly a consequence of American military outlay and entitlement programs such as Social Security together with the nation's unwillingness\nProfoundly wise policy we are as a nation are facing a looming retirement income crisis with the collapse of the defined benefit plan stagnated wages lots of home equity and so forth\nThe one part of our retirement gum system that continues to work extremely well your Social Security what we need to do is\nBuild on what works expand Social Security and to be very clear this myth of\nOh it's going back to front affordable\nThe question of whether to expand or cut Social Security as a matter of values we are the wealthiest nation in the world we're at the wealthiest moment of our history at this legislation that's been introduced or about a dozen bills the various ways of expanding Social Security and paying for it\nFake show I'm so quickly that if we want to extend benefits we can do so responsibly but the other side does not want to make this a question of values because the American people overwhelmingly whether you're conservative or liberal Republican Democrat\nAll genders all races everyone we all overwhelmingly agree that Social Security works we don't want to see it cut we'd like to see it expanded\nFolks may remember Paul Ryan thing that he's been dreaming about cutting Medicaid since he was standing around the Kagame college\nYou know and it sounds like super villain talk you know you you've been in a room with these people what is the social vision that they have that that backs\nEliminating Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid what what you will the word\nIdeological view and a matter of their donors you know how much money flows to Wall Street from Social Security none but if you cut Social Security back more money would go to Wall Street more money would go in fees and that's of course\nWhat their donors want so there's only a small splinter group\nThat opposes program but they tend to be extremely wealthy and was because they say oversized influence so that's one but there isn't\nAn ideological opposition to the Koch brothers and people like that and that is\nAnti government they want government to do nothing you know maybe a military of that you know that sort of this idea that we don't want to pay taxes we've got our own gated community it'll all of that\nIn starting in Nineteen thirty six the Republican to a friend who was the Republican nominee for president ran for\n... against Social Security he lost in a landslide through were opponents in the Nineteen fifties they last like teen sixties Nineteen seventies when something shifted now everyone loves Social Security but it's on affordable for very children it's\nYou know people are cheating of whatever it is I call it a solution in search of a problem because the the solution was always cut Social Security problems very but\nToday's Republicans do not have the courage of their convictions they won't stand up and say we'll like Social Security we think of socialism we by cutting back they say we love Social Security\nWe need a bipartisan solution but we're against taxes because we've got to cut it\nWell I I Want to ask you a a final question about media because although you're outlining distinct differences between Democrats and Republicans right now\nI see increasingly critics calling out media for sometimes hiding reality in that part is then frame you know I'm Paul Krugman and Michael help pick up the LA Times so it's kind of side died reporting that was saying\nDemocrats claim the geo he wants to make cuts to Social Security or you know Democrats may actually there's not a relationship between Social Security and the deficit and they make these things that are just true they put them in the mouths of Democrats and it makes it seem as though the facts of the matter are partisan\nExactly and you know I have some sympathy\nFor the media they want to see him nonpartisan but you know if one side is saying the earth is flat and the other side of saying the earth is round\nI don't think it's appropriate to say well these people say the earth is flat these this route I mean there is an objective reality and in this case there is no question that the Democrats in their twenties sixteen platform which did not get covered\nVery much cold for expanding Social Security not cutting it and it is a fact that it has been costs that out by the nonpartisan\nActually that the Social Security administration that the John Larson Twenty one hundred act is projected to both expanding benefits and pay them\nFully through the twenty first century so you know they might get clicks with the old against the younger the Democrats against the Republicans but I think it's a disservice\nFor programs like Social Security that as I say it's supposed to provide peace of mind that when you start saying well these people say it's going bankrupt to just report it because it it really does a disservice to all of a [noise]\nI Want to just push you one final question because it's it's a fused throughout the reporting is just the language entitlement program and I think you just you think something when you hear that\nLiteral meaning there's this sense that somehow it's on there and and I know you've covered the ground but what do you what's your reaction and when you hear Social Security Medicare Medicaid described as entitlements\nWell it's outrageous and it really is back to what we were just talking about about those who oppose these programs won't come out and faith so they use the pejorative label that sounds like a government handout well you know we've done focus groups on this and we find that\nPeople if you say what's in a title that they don't think it's Social Security when you tell them all that's what people in Washington they they get angry because they see that they contribute to Social Security\nWith every paycheck it's insurance it's an earned benefit and I think the real proof is that a synonym for entitlement is mandatory spending you'd never hear them talk of added as mandatory spending I had a colleague who\nWorked on a commission and the Nineteen nineties to work on so called the title month and he joked that uh turned a boring budgetary eleven letter word title months into the proverbial four letter word this is part of the billionaires get paid in fact Pete Peterson the billionaire I was talking about\nHow to organize that condition was on this is part of the strategy to make it sound like it's a government handout to make it sound like it's full of fraud all the things that it's not and it's really defined the debate\nWe've been speaking with Nancy Altman president up Social
