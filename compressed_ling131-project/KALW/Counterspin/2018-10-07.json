weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson\nThis week on counter spin as we record the show on October force it looks as though Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nDespite well despite so very many things why are Republicans so set on pushing through a candidate opposed by a coalition of Christian churches as well as more than a thousand law professors as well as anybody concerned about sexual assault\nAnd beyond his temperament what are we know about Kavanaugh's record as a judge will talk about that with Marjorie cone professor emeritus at Thomas Jefferson school of law and former president of the national lawyer scaled\nAlso on the show these those on bound says the cover of the car at Forbes magazine stating of the head of Amazon dot com quote he's\nBuilt the most innovative and feared juggernaut of the twenty first century and every industry is now fair game close quote\nSo that's good\nIs it appropriate for media to approach Amazon as though it's simply a better mouse trap and bees those as though his bank account of a hundred and sixty billion dollars can coexist happily alongside workers who just had their minimum wage pushed\nOr sanction about the impact of Amazon size its influence and its values on community [noise] we'll hear from journalists Neal demaio is author of most recently the Brooklyn wars that's all coming up you're listening to counter spin brought to you each week by the media watch groups fair\nDonald Trump's public mockery of Christine Blasey Ford the woman who testified she was assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh wasn't acutely despicable spectacle and an administration that is no sugar when it comes to despicable spectacle\nBut the Kavanaugh hearings the FBI quote unquote investigation into allegations against him the whole process seemed to indicate more serious failures than Trump's vindictive creeping us\nWhat is going on here and what might mean for the Supreme Court going forward Marjorie Cohn is professor emeritus at Thomas Jefferson school\nOf law former president of the national lawyers build and deputy secretary general of the international association of democratic lawyers she joins us now by phone from San Diego welcome back to counter spend Marjorie ... thanks for having me Janine\nWell we're in media arrests here of course we just heard this morning October forth\nThat the FBI had completed its investigation which Susan Collins called very thorough despite not including statements from four door dozens of others who wanted to ah contribute\nI have so many questions but they really all kinds of amount to how is this happening how are we had a place where a man who ... his way through his hearings snarling and accusing and making clear that he hates Democrats the Clintons and the left\nCould even be considered to have the temperament appropriate to a Supreme Court justice [noise]\nWell that's an excellent question but it's very clear and it's been clear from the start that the Republican leadership in concert with Donald Trump is going to ram this nomination through\nSo that they can achieve a solid right wing majority on the Supreme Court which will last for decades and will reverse many of the rights that we hold dear\nThe Republicans know that Kavanaugh would provide a reliable vote against immigrants workers voters and gay and transgender people he would deliver it dependable votes for employers private property in church state bonding\nAnd they can rest assured that he would do is best to immunize Trump from criminal liability and enabled him to continue their mean spirited right wing agenda and this is more important to them than any judicial temperament than any credible allegations of sexual assault\nBecause the bottom line issue one of the most significant issues is\nAbortion rights reproductive rights and overturning roe v Wade in addition to gay rights and they have rationalized all of these other horrors 'em to that and\nKevin all seems so tainted though at this point why not just some other conservative what is it about the timeline that you think makes them feel like they have to keep going with this candidate over the objection of now you know millions of people\nWell in part they want cabin on the Supreme Court before the November sixth term\nIn the Senate and then there might not be sufficient votes to confirm him after the election um that's the most immediate consideration but they were in a hurry to get him confirmed by October first which was the first day of the Supreme Court's new term\nAnd they want to help ensure the outcome of several hot button cases that are on the court docket including cases involving double jeopardy immigration age discrimination and the endangered species act and\nThere is a possibility that the court might decide to take up cases involving gerrymandering gay and transgender rights and the separation of church and state\nWell you've been writing about Brett Kavanaugh for a while now and you have pointed out there's plenty to undermine his candidacy even before we get to sexual assault allegations and be those other things are in a way that risk almost being overlooked and one of the concerns\nIs around his record international law and the power of the president what are the flag bearer on again they're nothing to do with his quote unquote personality but they're derived from his public record as a judge\n[laughter] well keep in mind that international law in so far as the United states has ratified treaties or customary international law are part of US law under the supremacy clause of the constitution and yet Kavanaugh\nHas nothing but scorn for international law and he confuses international law with foreign law international law as as I said is treaty law and customary international law which is customs that countries have built up over the years\nBut foreign law is totally different it's the law of France or Brazil or Germany and he conflate the two now that he's been on the court of appeals and during the\nBush administration's so called war on terror\nCabin up almost always deferred to the president on executive power now the Supreme Court during the Bush administration did check and balance\nThe executive the the president and said that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by Guantanamo detainees they said that a U.S citizen who's being held as an enemy combatant has due process rights\nTo contest his detention and they said that Bush's military commissions violated the Geneva Conventions and the federal uniform code of military justice now in two thousand eight the Supreme Court ruled in ... versus Bush\nThat Guantanamo detainees held as enemy combatants have the right to file a B is corpus petitions in us federal courts to say on being unlawfully held but after ... cabin on the court of appeals did his best to try to neuter\nThese habeas corpus rights that the Supreme Court has upheld in blue median in case after case and also\nKavanaugh has a at a record of dangerous difference to the president not withstanding the case of Jones versus Clinton the Paula Jones case which said that a president has to answer to at least a civil case that didn't involve a criminal case\nKavanaugh doesn't think that a president should be bothered to answer to a civil or criminal case while he's in office and under us versus Nixon a unanimous Supreme Court said that Nixon had to turn over the tapes during the Watergate scandal and that led to Nixon's resignation and yet\nBut one of the interesting things\nIs you know we sort of have this idea of the way to respond to corporate malfeasance\nIn our age is a vote with our pocketbooks right and we learn from boycott movements and you know I remember back twenty Thirty years ago there was a spate of like paperbacks of came out about you know how to shop for a better world\nAnd we very much is sort of the east coast with modern times that you make a statement with your dollars\nAnd that was not always the case in one of the things I found interesting in researching this article\nWas the degree to which that was first of all a response to some of the\nBig corporate chains like in ... in the twenties and thirties trying to get people to identify more as consumers because they want people thinking and you know and the voting on the basis of what's best for me for you know easy shopping and not\nWhat's best for me as a worker what's best for me as a business owner who has to compete with these chains\nAnd then again after that starting in the sixties and running through the eighties and nineties not till today consumer movements as a response to our lack of political power and other ways right you know if if Congress has all filled out the corporations at least we can vote with our dollars the\nProblem of course being that that's not a very effective way of of accomplishing things so you know what are they doing the article was sort of look at what you can do when you go to shop but also what you can do to affect our shopping choices at our corporate world outside of that sort of consumer base if\nWe have so much first of all that's presented in kind of\nHas been a shift a ... and now we talk about companies are they good companies or the bad companies but he used to be that just bigness itself just size itself of a power was considered to be a cause for concern\nYeah and and you know clearly Amazon with this announcement this week of you know raising their minimum wages is trying to cast themselves as we're not bad guys were good guys right\nAnd that's kind of not you know shouldn't be the point right I mean it's nice that they're doing that um but does that mean that we should trust a company with massive control over all areas of are consuming experience and our entertainment\nExperience and our cultural experience and the ability to compile massive amounts of data from our\nBehaviors and all these different places does it make it better if they're nicer people rather than worse people I mean I guess a little bit but really if we're going back to the principle that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\nThe idea is really nobody should be trusted with that level of power which is the whole point of the anti trust movement of late nineties that early twentieth century\nAnd I think one of the realization here is that what you know Stacy Mitchell was saying how quickly in my article\nIs that we need to not just approach this as how do we find that most conscientious way to shop but we need to really have to return to\nAnti trust you know we really haven't had a strong anti trust movement to break up these enormous monopolies in the last few decades and you know regardless of whether it's Democrats or Republicans in power we really need to start pushing in that direction\nWell in a what Stacy Mitchell from the Institute for local self reliance says is that folks are starting to see that she thinks you know that there was a period where Amazon with this bright shiny thing that made life easier and now it's starting to shift a bit to people recognizing that\nCancelling your prime account is not necessarily going to be enough given that as you report it a lot of what Amazon does is out of the reach of individuals' they're selling to public agencies they're selling you know over your head um in in a sense but\nThere is movement afoot to talk about anti trust in a way that that might make it more meaningful again\nYeah and the FCC is holding hearings and there's an anti trust caucus in Congress now and they're you know some rumblings\nAnd I think things like you know obviously Facebook breaches and all the other sort of big malfeasance that were clearly seen by some of these big overarching corporations\nHe's starting to get attention not just from consumer advocate for the world but also in Congress than in other places but it's going to have to be a big push obviously right because you know Amazon and company like that\nHave the ability not just to lobby like crazy but also to do things like\nTry to undercut opposition by simply saying hey we're going to ah we're going to raise their minimum wages with the cat is not nothing\nBut it's an attempt to deflect right attempt to get people off their backs I think something that is going to be a battle not just over the next year or two but over the next decade or two to really sort of try and push back again in the same way that\nIt took decades to fight the power the monopolies whether we're railroads or whoever standard oil back in the late nineties early twentieth century\nAnd probably now as well as then investigative journalism is going to play a role and and that leads me to a Segway you were until recently the news editor at the village voice launched in Nineteen fifty five the personal turn it in Newsweek clean\nThe village voice has ceased publication and that has a lot of meaning\nIt changed over its history certainly it means different things to different people what did the village voice means for you and what do you think it's closure means for the city\nYeah I mean you know there's been a lot of talk in the same way there is an awful lot of things these days especially in New York about well you know the voice wasn't what it used to be any way what in journalism is right now I had written for the voice for Twenty years and I've been out of there are there the last couple\nYou know one of the things that I really realized the more time I spent working on the voice was the special role that it really had to play in terms of being\nA real alternative to the corporate media and you know some of what you see in other outlets if you know really\nWas sort of the predecessor of a lot of the sort of ... things like you know like for example which has a great job\nBut the voice really had at uh Billy and sort of those of trying to be both the funniest and witty if people in the room and also the smartest and the most serious about the journalism and I think it's something that you know I'd like to think that we carried out until the until the bitter end\nAnd I'm obviously ready for other places as what right now and of other people who you know contributed voice are going to continue to do that too\nBut I Hope that there will still be room for that kind of journalism in the world you know stuff that makes us laugh\nBut at the same time stuff that really does the best of what a dress code of journalism is supposed to do not just giant articles trying to win Pulitzer is but really exposing the dynamics of power exposing what we need to do in order to change our world for the better\nSo I'm very sad to see the voice go not just as a staffer and as a writer but as a reader of it and I hope that people who are thinking of journalistic endeavor that future try and find a way to make that that sort of project work again because I think it's what we still very much need\nWe've
