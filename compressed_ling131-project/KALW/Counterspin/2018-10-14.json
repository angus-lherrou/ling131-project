A. O. would be releasing a critical report\nFor a media activists the storm and the official response only under scored the need for the creation of communication systems grounded in community\nWill talk to someone working on just that Teresa ... director of resilient just technologies also on the show we've just seen how a number of states and cities have changed the\nWe'll stay a long overdue exercise and shifting attention from a mass murderer to the people whose lives cultures on land were devastated\nBut given that indigenous peoples in the U.S today face wildly disproportionate rates of police violence incarceration sexual violence and homelessness it should be clear that a conversation that begins and ends with history is not enough\nWe'll talk about going beyond symbols with writer and educator I'm Russell among director of the community and Labour project at University of California San Diego where she is a doctoral candidate in ethnic studies\nThat's coming up you are listening to counter spin brought you each week by the media watch groups fair\nAdvocates and activists are calling on FCC chair a jeep pi to appoint an independent commission to examine the causes for communications failures in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria just over a year ago\nOver Ninety five percent of cell sites were knocked out of service hindering rescue and recovery efforts days after the storm no TV and only a handful of radio stations could function and the restoration has been painfully slow\nThe coalition of groups also urged the agency to convene public hearings in Puerto Rico so that commissioners could hear directly from Puerto Ricans on how their lives were impacted by the lack of a resilient communications infrastructure [noise]\nBut the conversation around communications in Puerto Rico is not primarily one of petitioning the powerful\nIf anything the hurricane and the inadequate federal response have made clear or the need for other kinds of work and other places\nThat can give people more power over their communications rights as part of the fight for all of their rights our next guest is part of that work\nToday ... is director of resilient just technologies as well as an artist and organizer she's just back from the case and joins us now by phone from Brooklyn welcome to counter spin ...\nThank you well when we talk about communication failures in Puerto Rico after Maria we're talking of course about\nPeople who couldn't check on their family and friends because phones weren't working failures that may have increased the storms death toll of at least three thousand new research says as many as five thousand\nHuman beings the work you're doing seems to grow out of recognition of the full list meaning of communications technology and storytelling and how they meet\nSo what were you doing in the case and what does or doesn't it have to do with events of the past year\nWell first off I'm I'm from Puerto Rico originally I was born there but I was raised like many of my ... raised in the states\nBut I've continued to have a very deep connection with for the call and so in the past few years my emphasis has moved to trying to figure out really\nTangible ways to support the process of the conversation for the call because I have been working in media for a long time prior to this work I worked at global action project which is a huge media social justice organization so I work with young people and creating collaborative\nFilms that tells the story of what their issues are and how to resolve it and so I come from a doctor and a story telling myself on being the imports\nSo as a way to build community and so I moved into the work of technology and I started resilient just technologies is a way\nTo kind of garner all of the things that I've learned and the people that I've been fortunate to work with to see if I could leverage\nAll the different things that ... from the communications and convinces which includes not\nJust the communications but media political education decentralized technology you know storytelling a whole host of things that are interconnected with the idea of communications and so I was looking to leverage all of these different ideas for organizers in the front lines of racial economic and climate justice movements\nAnd so I've been working here in New York with New York city communities who are building local networks wireless networks for use in emergencies and for community organizing and so\nI really wanted to figure out how to use that knowledge and relationships and understandings to support my folks in Puerto Rico and the ...\nI was in the I guess just got back a few days ago I was in Vietnam as any comedy all to areas that for a variety of reasons have a long history both of struggle as well as of just really innovative ways of organizing communities so I was there to talk to\nCommunities who were directly impacted by the last of the communications infrastructure falling both hurricanes Irma and Maria as we saw or as we know of the communication system completely failed and so the purpose of these conversations with your story circles which is a a\nCultural organizing tool that comes from the south here in the U.S and the idea is to really in community have a conversation about that's what happened to us what was the impact of that\nAnd then also talk about what does adjusts communication system look like for people to really a vision ing as well and affirming the ways in which we've been able to organize already and protect ourselves in our communities and what came out of these conversations was\nA whole lot of stuff I mean there was the clear evidence of trauma and not just not being able to reach her relatives but not being able to reach\nMedical care not even knowing like what's happening day to day if there's access to clean water food was coming up so many things that people were just cut off from completely their basic human rights to communication the stories are really important to have really tell what really has been the impact but also as a healing justice\nPart of the work I think that\nSome of the times we have these conversations but we don't talk about the impacts of trauma in our communities and how we need spaces together and community to to really deal with it and address it and move together to continue supporting each other through it so I was in both ... to facilitate those stories are close with my\nFriends that free press and with most federal Saudi Arabia runs a healing justice and the colonization project import those people called step up\nAnd you're talking about the importance of these conversations and then there is the matter of creating and maintaining the space in which to have those conversations and there's where the technology can come in you know so I wanted to ask you about these portable network kits that you also work with\nRight so part of the project and my understanding of community technology as well as the just transition for what does he called means that our communities also need to have access to the infrastructure I think it's one thing to say you know we're going to push the FCC and the telecoms to do the right thing\nThat's another whole other projects to validate people's self determination by the ownership and governance of their infrastructure and so in a colonial situation these things are very very difficult and so the conversations that I've been having people there is like what technology is available that could support a lot of these\nJust removing the symbol really address the historical trauma and it definitely didn't address the fact that those systems still or the structure and foundation of this country\nWhere we heard it said earnestly yes but it's a step in the right direction but certainly in the corporate media anyway taking down the statues changing the name of holidays is presented as a dethrone ing and a controversial wanted that you know it's still up for debate\nAnd not as part of any plan of action in other words it's not seen as a piece of something larger it's kind of the end game [noise]\nYeah that's the problem [laughter] you know is that for most of us to\nActually those of us in indigenous communities who are experiencing these overwhelming statistics and didn't much women are more likely to experience disappearance sexual assault murder domestic violence than any other category of woman\nFor the native people are more incarcerated than any other category far more likely to experience police brutality [noise] those are the goals that we want to focus on the end of federal patriarchy the end of rape culture the end of the ... not incarceration of people's color and indigenous people\nStand up police brutality and removing the symbol of those things\nIllnesses to open conversation about those conversations needs to lead towards concrete action you know I think there's two ways that folks react to it on the one hand like I'm not criticizing indigenous people who participate in those action\nWhat they're doing is we occupy space stolen and so what they're doing is you know not just declaring that were still alive but we're still here but also that we have concern right that we have concerns that matter that needs to be addressed\nAnd that there's something about that the occupation such empowering for them but the way that I see\nInstitutions and cities take up the holiday is exactly opposite of that and I should have re occupation\nIt's more like this multi cultural consumerism that just puts you know the is ought to says oh I'm In business culture on display for settlers typically show and that's inherently different power it\nIt shouldn't be too hard for people to imagine a city on arena and recognizing on paper\nIndigenous people while at the same time just to creating sacred sites are polluting land in water or defunding social programs and so you have to think about it isn't just that it isn't enough\nIt actually can provide a kind of cover for those kinds of behaviors\nAnd in most cases it does I mean I think if you look at large cities like you know you look at the first is it just people say it was in Berkeley, California and\nThere's been since that time were the day was commemorated ongoing desecration of alone any land desecration of graveyards desecration of sacred sites\nMarginalization of indigenous people there and I guess you know everywhere else but it's been taking up\nIn Los Angeles and Phoenix [noise] you know across the board that the holiday is just you said something to make settlers feel like they're doing something without actually doing something\nWell I remember in New York Times story around the Dakota access pipeline struggle in which the reporter\nTalked about how indigenous people want to think about going back to what time before treaties you know which first of all of course what many would wanted for treaties to be honored you know but I I thought it represented a pervasive kind of\nVague sympathy that we see that in fact dismissive and and even in ... you know it's like oh wouldn't we all like to go back to\nA time of clean water when we were as one with the earth you know but at last we're grown up and we know that that's just silly you know it was a throwaway phrase in this article but it seemed to me to to represent a lot about how you can\nSort of throw sympathy towards the group while at the same time suggesting that they don't really have concerns that need to be actively addressed [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm a one had like it reinforces a lot of negative stereotypes ExxonMobil Savage but\nIt also reinforces this idea that indigenous people are are a race to be included and to be visible lives like our culture is there for the consumption versus indigenous nations having sovereignty\nAnd having the first rights to this land and also the the right of self determination and the right to protect our own people you know\nSo it kind of a live all of those concerns that fall into broadly the work of sovereignty probably the work because of the conversation or abolition\nWell many people are if not literally young you know a newly aware in their own experience newly becoming aware of the deeply painful history of this country you know and it's ongoing affects than its daily reproduction and it's ...\nWhat would you tell them about what it would take to make indigenous people's day campaign not a mirror rebranding but actual platforms first struggle\nAnd I think people are trying to do this so I'm going to say that but I'm also going to acknowledge that there are many indigenous people actually working on the sly and actually trying to strategize how can we use the holiday then a more effective way\nShow one of the things that I think if we're trying to change the relationships the social relationships that are constructed by colonialism by the ongoing process of genocide nothing concentration slavery\nThrough patriarchy that we have to start with the truth you know if you think about any of synthetic relationship it's built on sure\nWe have to be able to share the actual truth of what happened and some people use the holiday as a platform to try to get those messages out there some people are trying to use it as the educational opportunity to really control but\nThe truth of what happened and and what is ongoing what is still happening\nBut I think beyond that you know it has to be more than just education as well like our relationships with each other actually to transform and and so it does need to be part of a larger profit they manifest in actual material change\nMaterial change in our social relation some material change in our policies you know the policies of the schools the cities that are honoring are claiming to honor people\nNeed to change their policies towards edition of people was the lead lead to change\nWe've been speaking with ... you can still find the peace up rooting colonialism the limitations of indigenous people's day on indigenous action dot org thank you I'm Rochelle among for joining us this week on counter spin thank you\nAnd that that for a counter spin for this week counter spin is produced by fair the national
