to counter spin brought to each week by the media watch group fair\nIn a typical corporate media story on the family separations and deportations and asylum denials that define immigration policy under Donald Trump the images and sometimes voices of immigrants are essentially a less active\nThey add color and specificity but say their actions don't generally set the frame of the story\nThe objects of policy immigrants still somehow are not the central subjects the main drivers of the story of their lives\nCentering immigrants and their agency changes the fabric of reporting and shift the static understanding of the situation opening ways forward beyond the logjam of hopelessness and frustration so many now feel\nTina Vasquez is the senior immigration reporter at rewire dot news she joins us now by phone from North Carolina Welcome back to counter spent ...\nThank you for having\nAmnesty International released a report just last week usa you do not have any rights here documenting multiple sorts of abuses at the U.S Mexico border\nInvolving punishing asylum seekers I suppose some what surprised to see it ignored by so called mainstream media there was a piece on Newsweek online voice of America actually ran some thing\nBut for a report that pulled together a number of current concerns including how customs and border protection start defining family\nI guess I hoped for more but you reported on this for ... what did you find important in that amnesty report that people should know about\nI guess that I and and the shocking is the number of families that were actually separated how even though and it provided and that number that's more than ... originally reported the anesthesia putting that more than six thousand families\nMinistry ... family separation policy that was announced are confirmed by Jeff Sessions and I believe it was April two thousand Eighteen it actually started to get rolled out quietly in July of two thousand Seventeen and so\nThey think that it impacted Fifteen thousand individual people and more than six thousand families and that still is just an estimate because\nWhen the policy was being rolled out more quietly with less oversight and without any sort of eyes on it publicly there's really no telling how many families were subjected to the policy how many families remain separate it or how many children were kind of disappeared into a system in their parents as well deported to never be seen again it was a really\nShocking report and that was just one part of it you mentioned a lot of the abuses that they're seeing a great deal of attention is devoted to the treatment of transgender women in particular who are migrating to the U.S seeking asylum\nLemon and the report report being sexually abused and assaulted in detention being detained alongside men and really having no recourse not receiving medical care for things that they need\nIt's a wide swath abuses that cover very very vulnerable people\nOne of the authors of the report indicated that in some of the situations are the behavior actually conforms to international recognized criteria for torture\n[laughter] yeah I mean I also spoke to an immigration attorney who told me he's representing some of the clients that were in the report and that he certainly thinks of this is torture and that falls along those\nLines and those definitions because the psychological damage that that parents experience not knowing where their children are for so long that knowing if they will see them and again and of course there's the damaged the children experience some are reporting that could be irreparable\nIt's been such a disturbing harmful\nI Can't use the word I Want to use it's been a mess and and now the Trump Administration is considering\nI'm rolling it out again so the public outcry while really overwhelming at times and it seemed to be the reason why the executive order signed it didn't seem enough to stop the Trump Administration from continuing this policy\nWill part of what informative reporting like yours does demonstrate\nContinuity and this juncture in immigration policies and practices it's not about Obama versus Trump or Democrats versus Republicans you know it's it's you know do we want a humane welcoming society and how do we go towards that or do we want a racist motive is one you know things have\nHappened before and still be worse now and that seems very important to to underscore and to make some so\nIf nothing else would I Hope that my reporting guys is it makes it clear and I'm really unapologetic and my stance on this as a journalist I think we're told that we're supposed to be unbiased but\nI can show you facts and evidence to show you that the U.S immigration system is inherently abusive and violent and racist and so what you're saying as the products of that it's just being wielded by a different administration that is more overtly\nAnti immigrant and more comfortable being overtly racist but that is always nice starting point and doing immigration reporting it doesn't matter who is in the White House that's that's the starting point that the tension is inhumane and violent and so is the immigration system\nWell when I was talking about letting immigrants action set the dynamic of the story rather than the u._s. government announced this policy here some quotes from immigrants in response I was thinking about recent pieces of yours one that ran on ...\nWay the activities are handled on public space in Washington is\nThere a demonstration activities which is you know all First Amendment activity that's handled separately because there is a fundamental understanding that that is what our public spaces or for a public spaces are for the public to use for free speech for dissent for debate for discussion of what matters\nWhen you come to Washington DC you are at the heart of the concept of petition the government for redress have grievances that is part of the basic mission of the national Park Service it is part of what they're supposed to do they don't\nOwn our public spaces the government doesn't own our public spaces there the stewards of our public spaces and they were simply supposed to manage them but they want to treat this now is if our public parks or public lands\nAre somehow their property there the wealthy land owners and they're letting us walk on their manicured lawns in charging us for them it's completely different than if a special event\nOr commercial film wants to come you space in Washington that shouldn't be charged to the taxpayers Wonder Woman was here during the summer I'm sure that costs in many hundreds of thousands of dollars\nAnd that is something that the Park Service is supposed to recoup from private commercial profit making venture as\nIt is completely different than First Amendment activity they want to conflate those two on top of all this they uh my organization the partnership for social justice funded a line by line review of the proposed regulations and found that they had hidden in there that they were closing the iconic White House sidewalk\nTo protest to this is the location that all of us can imagine people picketing and demonstrate on the sidewalk with a White House\nDemonstrations the anti war civil rights you know and fire metal writes all DVD everyone has gone to that location but the Trump Administration literally wants to take the ground out from underneath our feet\nWell Ryan Zinke he said we're just putting these things out there as ideas and a quote we want to have a genuine conversation with the public close club\nWhat that translated to was a public comment period which I understand that it's a recognized way that these process and he's worked at the same time\nYou know hey uh my nightly news must have missed it because I didn't hear anything trying to encourage me to engage in this public comment period about something that I might really care about you know so what did the process to look like and then you know folks did way and then what happened\nThey put out their proposal to public comment which closed October Fifteen that midnight and we started a massive public education and outreach campaign we digested this hundred page nearly a hundred page proposal broke it down\nWe reached so many organizations and groups who are reaching their own constituencies to get public comment in and that number which is still going up because uh comments are still registering even though the period as close\nAs now surpassed Seventy thousand comments\nIn response to Trump's anti protest plan but this language from thinking that they're just asking the question is not entirely accurate that is true with regard to one of the proposals but for all the rest of these extremely damaging proposals they wrote regulations\nThat will go into final rulemaking and that's why we were really focused on this public comment period to get some substantial comments in\nBecause an age of the month actually consider\nA substantive comments that are meaningful comments before can go to final rulemaking and explain how the final rules have considered those comments so many organizations put in very detailed very thoughtful comments a lot of affidavits and so we were building this administrate of record because we expect\nThat we will be litigating to stop these regulations were planning to file litigation as necessary torn joined them but we need to have the record underneath us which now we believe has been built in order to effectively do that\nWell let me just ask you what you hinted towards that but what's gonna happen going forward I hate to tell listeners\nThere was a time to weigh in but it's over you know obviously these are issues that will affect all of us in a deep way going forward and so I'd like to know kind of what's what's going to be happening and what can people do about it\n[noise] well I think there's a lot of ongoing activity that can happen there was a lot of a public awareness and public pressure that can be brought\nTo make this an extremely difficult process for the administration to move forward on you know some of the other proposals they haven't here they wrote regulations that would ban any future occupy action they will not allow any demonstration to exist\nFor more than thirty days you know you can see what they're trying to do they don't want any sustained presidents ever existing in the nation's capital again they have rules that would\nEliminate the certainty that permit applicants have when they submit applications and change the system so that there's basically a limbo system where the Park Service can just sit on permit applications for months at a time so for people to speak out on this and be raising awareness and ...\nAnd it's extremely valuable extremely important and we will be working with a lot of
