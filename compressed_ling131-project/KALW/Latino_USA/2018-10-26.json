politics yeah from right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise] that notion mhm\nTo be\nThe next or to be like ...\nOur identity\nIs the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican\nI Know that I Am African\nI Am indigenous\nAm also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ...\nAnd to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are\nThese are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhat were your mom and dad\nSpeaking to you and saying look Sunday Anita\n... he was proud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday or you're in New York or through and through however you want to define\nYourself you know I was\nVery strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level sell the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy so hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat ... do you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is still intersection all\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nAnd so what what it means to be American and what we grew up in like how we grew up on these values was my dad\nWe'd go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah\nYou mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it would be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where we went on family she cried\nWell and that's\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough\nYou know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy risk you know what I\nAm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress I\nThink I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but\nHad a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my\nFavorites is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nHad to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be resist or an interesting question how are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what do the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\nIt is and if any thing\nThere are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain and in my heart\nI feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the sixth grades is terrifying\nI feel like I have this huge target\nBecause I'm embodying\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like\nSometimes I talk to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my that\nThere was an article I think it was in the New York or were they made a point of rain out that when you talk to your kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be in your yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect a political tactic world\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nFunnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around\nThe kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents are natural organizers they were so good at building community\nWas a public school\nThirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nKind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nThe kinds of people that I went to school and\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling\nAnd so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... going to talk because those are the people that are family could relate to [noise]\nThey were always about leaning in\nAnd the politics comes back and\nAnd that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs\nMy number one job is to care about people and to lean into them\nShow them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWhat is your puppy same to you when you're hearing your dad\nI think [noise]\nIt's like I'm so close although\nI'm Sorry no it's All right that's right oh my gosh\nNo it's okay what is the prime tell me what your\nUm just because it's like\nNo one's asked me that question\nSo\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not\nA process thing this has you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and there's some ... and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy I think\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n[noise]\nThe last thing\nMy dad ever told me before he passed away\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time\nI felt like I felt\nLike I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like\nAnd\nIs like what wash\nI don't even know I feel like my dad would be like what have you gotten yourself and\nWhy we must file to ... yeah but\nWill be smiling she'd be smiling I saw two [noise]\nBoth in\nSociety and was in her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise]\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\n[noise]\n\nThank you for putting it into words Eric ... we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate your interview\n[noise]\nErica ... is the author of the New

other Latino demographic in New York City it's all about the data out data points can help us understand the future of young Latinos in New York and beyond stay with us something about you

Latinos are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path\nTo the middle class [noise] [noise] these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conduct demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City [noise] their data helped bring you the stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are ... he's the organizations director of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n... ... ...\n... lives are when I first met you you were like proudly the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there and the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research\nAnd data so what's the ...\nThat particular line of work that we're talking about\nStems from one day I went with my\nParents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nSuffer Washington Heights in the wake of the day you wake up but I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about ... a Broadway musical by ...\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about while I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity\nWithin the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within\nLatino Americans in between the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the date a little bit to see well\nIf I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised you ...\nWorking in New York City schools and it and the policy field\nSo much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities of Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and\nThe largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican orange and in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City\nSo I started to think well if the policy\nOne issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both in ways that make them great and the ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's it like that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Tina non Latino one thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights\nInteresting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group best we prepare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families\nFrom Dominican origins and what we find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics\nThe culture pervades all the different groups in the school for the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans for the New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the costs going culture may not be as strong [noise]\nMeeting ... still there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing what would it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces\nIs that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and lacking in the United states increasingly I think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis\nAnd now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengths and different communities and we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work\nThere's a question about race and then there's the next question about ethnicity so in race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other and then the next question is are you Hispanic\nAnd based on what community they come from we start to see real changes in how different groups of Hispanics people answer the race question\nAnd that's when I think open up a whole new understanding of how race and identity are interacting with some of the current conversations that we're having that is really again or allowed us to desegregate things in a very interesting way both interesting intellectually but then I think as we have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "San Francisco", "day":
