forklift truck simulator two thousand and on social [laughter]\n... this is a forklift simulator game\nI guess the world is overrun with boxes of pipes and it's up to me to stop the infant dish\nIt's like a video of like people playing you know plus on Youtube videos of themselves playing games yeah and then they other people I Love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it you know but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nAnd like driving a forklift around and trying to think about the night\nBut other places yeah but when I think it's funny to you and I want to show you that it's like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving ... like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast that feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five forty miles per hour someone else's I keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from ... off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nI got all these people they're commenting like actually drive ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of shots and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot\nOf our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing staff especially stuff that we order online [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nEvery shop to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility\nGave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that said no photos\nOnce a guard left me and I realize it's free time tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nThey have just under ...\nWe also have way more than a hundred times\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not\nSure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise workers were\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like roads which is good because\nWe will be another way of ADD stage IV these\nGuided vehicles basically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room because\nThey're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item operate in\nSay somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it online\nOnce they do that that's when the item gets\n...\nProvided them\n\nAnd they wanted me\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieves massager from shelf and then puts it on the yellow tray\nKind of like those airport security traits which go on a conveyor belt\nThat we're going to go and\nIs what it sounds\nBasically the ... comes in\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ... what are you\nI Can't keep on machines\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nHow many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nNormally do for shift so so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week [noise]\nThe very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is traded and gently place era [noise]\nThat sounds\nPlacing an accident [noise]\nHard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n... so the robots Amazon\nPretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands\nOf Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says these figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm at Amazon I asked learn about the\nYou know we don't have and power over white individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nConsequences of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voiced concerns [laughter]\n\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nWarehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers between people on things like wage theft and\nThe day I visit is Wayne Wilson he's twenty five and he drive forklifts for local warehouse is\nI like working in a way as good as ... you know your muscles as a child would go into\nTwain's been working in warehouses and the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills\nThe biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours\nThe Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse\nHe worked for a temp agency and the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them to do last week bill I wouldn't be in one day so\nTwain sometimes winds up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes the only one full week a month\nDoing shows me his phone he says they voted the sniffles or\nOkay so you'd have senior manager and the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow they can I at least worth friday liking of me anywhere and he does not just me Thursday night to see if I have nothing out there in Texas I worked in a while you know\nYeah that is a constant threat of that basically yeah kinda\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel\nQueen says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper\nTemp agencies provides a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and the lack of work or a steady paycheck\nMakes workers less likely to speak up\nBecause they don't want to re sacrificing the hours they do have\nIn ... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer\nBut that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of ... going to school like the things that is do\nI Wish I didn't complain about ... difficult anymore [noise]\nTemp work in all sectors is one of the fastest growing industries in the economy [noise]\nIt's hard to know exactly how many warehouse workers are tap but we do know that companies like Amazon temporarily higher hundreds of thousands\nOf seasonal workers for the holiday rush every year and these are the trends that Celine ... has been watching since the nineties she's the co executive director of the workers mentor Remy Twain she says companies see communities\nI I was five he was Fifteen and I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents\nWho either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that we are not believe and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way maybe my mother who hear these way [noise]\nAnd then it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and he said to him it was not your fault\nAnd it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed I didn't tell my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how did those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kinda without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being led the now from being an immigrant from being a mother and\nNow accepting and embracing these other part of my identity as a survivor I think the the history of these countries the history of the struggle for inclusion\nOf morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the\nThe act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nI think it was the mother and me\nSo the mother
