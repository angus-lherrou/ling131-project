I are following sure if ... she's the Democratic candidate for governor of Texas\nAnd we were with her on the campaign trail\nAnd after stopping in Odessa we drove about an hour northeast to Howard College in big spring Texas and other majority Latino city\nWe walk into a they're conditioned room at the college and we wait for the Howard county Democrats to announce that sure about this is their guests\nArmy but after lifting off her credentials the sheriff isn't really paying attention instead she leans over to us and points to a guy in the corner with a camera\nThat's my great haven't tracked me like right now to try to take my first people started to one of my goodness\nOh gosh just when I when we were Democrats or these\nHigh suddenly she's called up to the stage she's caught a little bit off guard and she adds up to the podium and we're watching her walk up and then we kind of get a chance\nTo look at who is in the room right so if up until this point it seems like Lubet out as as a candidate who has what it takes to deliver taxes to the Democrats the candidate who is of the people and for the people law enforcement algae teach you peel the working class\nThis is for that notion it's a bump in the road\nThere's about thirty five people in the room we're in\nAnd we noticed that potentially devastating campaign flop\nI'm I'm not really sure what we're trying to get 'em out\nThis is ray Nazis NATO's the Howard county democratic chair and looking around the room there are no young people here at all and we're at a college there are students everywhere who is in session\nThere's actually a room full of college students next door to us in the cafeteria eating lunch\nI don't think they're going to turn out as much as the older individuals I mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn now and I'm really not sure what the answer is Erwin ... [noise]\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this\nSeptember ... poll has sheriff held as his favorability rating among young people ten points lower and governor addicts younger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas or ages Eighteen to twenty nine\nThat's a large portion of Latino voters in this state where the Latino vote these heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and letting us and none of them are at this event so there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for ... days\nParticularly from young voters the first problem to share of has is name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent\nGovernor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the Sharon it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\n\nDuring the Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the sheriff's endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas they pointed out that during her tenure Cher sell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from jolt about his concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nAbility hurting\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now\nShe didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice\nIn fairness\nShe did famously go head to head was governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses\nSince Andrew white lost the Democratic primary\nJolt is now endorsing her for governor\nBut ... says oh we actually got a document\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progressive want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nI Want to go to that place but I don't have that power\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action\nAction can be taken in this before\nThis before is cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called F before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a wreck you broadcast the moment you know Facebook Live video it's our son in law liberal than sanctuary cities in the law essentially forcing local police to work with federal immigration officials and\nIt allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures\nLong for so long as you can and will cooperate with aren't sure if I did opposes the law\nAnd has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign\nShe also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nAnother policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part of\nI used to be reform\nSaying about the original task advice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them and it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let them come in\nAnd and do an attack on the city's sounds a little Republican what you're saying no it doesn't it sounds like we want to protect our country\nMm\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like this strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm of some young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nWhen we were in Odessa we met her Republican voter at the Mexican restaurant who told us\nTell me a Democrat I Know where you're at where you stand and that is not where I stand\nVery point blank so you're like Hi nice to view I don't even want to hear what you have to say\nWell what are the big reasons because Democrats are going so hard socialist there ought to bash now it's it's just it's just that's what big government lets did raise the taxes so we can say from the rich and give it to the floor [noise]\nSo here lies the crux of the problem for sure if I'm dead person that believes that her unique story of being the first gay Latino shirt and the country will reach a broad range of Texans but he could end up having the opposite effect\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nEarlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the\nLarger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House\nAnd directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration\nYou know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing as hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes then\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just messed up [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJust because they do so much for all of your reporting in for joining us on the news I think so much for having

[noise]\nAnd she didn't say a word she got a ... good of the girls it on and one of the room and this was hurting them\nCindy is a Mexican American mother of three and she was being arrested for the crimes of her ex boyfriend a drug dealer even though he'd been dead for six years the police charged Cindy for having lived in the same house as her ex boyfriend when he broke the law\nShe received a Fifteen year mandatory sentence for conspiracy [noise]\n[noise] I mean\nYou're going to charge [noise]\nPrevent any harm that way it is [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMm\nCindy story isn't unique it's part of something called the girlfriend problem it's a side effect of sentencing laws were women end up serving time for the drug crimes of their significant others\nEven though they had little to do with those crimes filmmaker Rudy Bond is turned his sister's Cindy's experience in prison into a documentary film called the sentence that just premiered on HBO\nAnd the film looks at the impact of Cindy's time in prison on her and her family and also her fight for early release\nI'm joined now by both Cindy and her brother Rudy to talk about the film and life during and after incarceration so Cindy what was your reaction at the very beginning so you just get sentenced to Fifteen Years and your brother's like hey I'm\nCan we make a documentary about this I mean did you kind of want to kill them at that point\nSo it wasn't a documentary and when he started to film a initially it was just he was taking videos of the girls for me so when I came home I could one day watch them run and play and you know the little girls 'cause I was missing all those things and so it wasn't until a few years later that\nWe want to tell your story and by then I had already met you know so many women who story was just like mine and\nI understood that nobody knew it was really going on and I wanted to share the story I wanted I thought it was very important I still think it's so important it was a devastating thing to happen to our family you know not just to me it happened to my mom my dad you know my daughter's\nIt was hard for them you know throughout this whole process so\nIt was an easy decision to say yes rather share a story like it was almost my way of you know screaming to the world what was happening\nThere a lot of things in this country that are filled with shame that we don't talk about one of those issues is incarceration and I really do appreciate the fact that this is something that most people would never want to reveal in you your whole family was like ruining take this public\nI think she was a great\nWord to bring up here because one of the layers and one of the overall themes that I wanted to bring about ... film\nWas shame and changing the stigma of being an incarcerated individual and what that meant and also being a family of incarcerated individual in what that meant and freely letting people look at what the true ramifications we're so that we could possibly\nPut a little bit of that shame on the system\nThere's a point in the film early in your sentence [noise] where you're talking to your then husband and you basically say like look I'm trying to hold it together here I'm not telling you how bad it is because I don't want you to know [laughter]\n\nWhat is it to be a woman in a prison\nWhat didn't you want to tell that you can tell him out\nI mean there's a lot of things there's we can go on and on I mean I never felt safe I mean they were mostly well they were all male guards there were always\nPeople who were needing a lot of mental health\nIt it was a very heightened emotional place to be so you couldn't say something to somebody without wondering how they were going to react they weren't bad people but they were put in bad situations and motions ran high\nI mean and I'm I'm figuring that there are some things that I'm Cindy isn't fame right about now\nYou write like she kept a lot of that from us throughout the incarceration and you know a lot of people will credit the family for me so strong and sticking by her throughout this entire process but you know in so many ways Cindy was the strongest person throughout this process you know she was she was dealing with something on her own\nKnow you get the sense that there's an intention to keep families separated\nLike it's not enough that you're going to just be in prison but we're going to move you so far away from your family that it's hard to see each other because you first started out in a prison that was in beacon New York you know somewhat close to where your family was but then suddenly you're moved to Florida", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
