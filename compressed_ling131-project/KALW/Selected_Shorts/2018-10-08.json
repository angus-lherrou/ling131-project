I joined [noise]\nI took a photo of the people the head of me and uploaded it onto the Internet along with the caption standing in red line what is his Soviet Russia [noise]\n\nA couple of minutes later I deleted it [noise]\n\nPretty soon the bread man arrived with his assistance [noise] I'm trying to say that without particular emphasis because\nI don't like the bread man [noise] and I want to downplay his star power [noise]\nBut it was quite an entrance\nHe pulled up to the curb in a red box like van that resembles an oven to gentle applause from his customers [noise]\nThe panel door rolled open and a couple of stringy deeply ten kids in their twenties a boy and a girl hopped out and wearing serious expressions\nUnloaded the bread man's gear a folding table\nA cash box a stool several large hinged wicker baskets a free standing wouldn't sign with men are painted on edge [noise]\nIn a bubbly but somehow ... script and then underneath and all precise caps sons sheriff quality breads\nThe kids made two trips into the ... shot before the bread men emerged and when he did an milling around the snout of the van while\nDistracted Lee rippling through pages six to a clipboard a chorus of greetings wind up from the crowd\nAnd Tom and Tom [noise]\nThe bread man look it up as though surprised [noise] he smiled he gave a little wave\nHello everybody [noise] thank you for coming [noise] will be set up in just a moment [noise]\nHe was my age but much better looking and much more at ease in his own skin that skin was white of course which is not to say pale it was as if he had been brushed with egg white and base to an even brown [noise]\n\nHe wore outsized eye glasses with black plastic frames over vaguely Semitic bookish features and his black hair and\nWere shaggy and flex with gray gray made him more handsome his short sleeved silk shirt was also black and dusted with flour as we're here\nSo yeah trickle to me [noise]\nCouldn't yes he was a big gr but where are these the clothes he ... [noise]\nI suspected it had been sprinkled their intentionally [noise] as a marker of our seasonal legitimacy [noise]\nHis feet were bear\nIt was unclear to me why the ... shop had been chosen as the picked up point\nIt was situated far from where the bread man's customers were likely to live in a neighborhood that wild quite safe by city standards wasn't nevertheless the staging ground for most of our towns violent crimes\nFor that matter I didn't know what the ... shop and chosen this location and the first place [noise] I never saw anybody there\nHe seemed to be some kind of crafts\nPeople's collective do all the merchandise looks the same fold primitive rendering of semi rural small town life on coffee mugs greeting cards T shirts and then what could only be seen as a deliberate effort to deter potential buyers mouse pads [noise]\n\nIn any of that all of this has now been pushed aside presumably by the assistance to accommodate the interests of the bread man's customers since I was last in line\nI spent the first ten minutes of the selling period in the stores under ventilated glass vestibule enduring magnified summer heat\nI texted my wife doors open don't forget the gotcha she texted back\nThat's the kind of coffee right I replied [noise]\nPlease just get it [noise]\n\nLooking at that exchange now I have never deleted attached I can see that trust was

written cylinder be assistance had to keep\nLeaning farther and farther into as though into a magic cat for a series of rare and desirable rabbits\n[noise] I had lost hope surely it would be gone before I reached the tape\nI wasn't last in line though Neal man was\nI had to admit to myself even inside the protective force field of smog mode that fits disparity between the old man's correct and actual positions in\nLine bothered me and it bothered me more and more as the line diminished\nWith only a few people remaining and the bread man beginning to repeat his monologue about baking times in temperature\nIs about the burning qualities of various woods and the medicinal properties of certain seeds I was injected from some other mode entirely and began to ... and puffing steel\nGlances at my phone one of the two assistants the boy caught the dust off his hands and walked around behind me to the door which he locked presumably to prevent the entry of newcomers he remained stationed there as a reverse jailer\nTo allow each customer out once he or she had accepted the bread man's large yes\nAs a last middle aged couple exited the boy assistant produced a tight smile that was gone by the time he blocked the rest of us back in\nThe old man stood in front of the line though it was just me him and the ... crew and he said his voice a dried strap of\nLeather the bread man's entire demeanor changed his shoulders slumped the hunting\nIs vanished from his face he held those hands out homes up and the old man took them in his\nOwn spoke father the bread men said an attempt and husky\nThe table and enveloped came in the brief embrace the to kiss each other's cheek\nAssistance as though released from a spell by the bread man's affection approach the old man bowed out of the word that I now understood to be\nHis name spoke father spoke father [noise]\nConversation was lively of secret is\nThe man of crew inquired about the old man's European soldier and his inner quest which may or may not have been the same\nThing [noise] they asked after old bones\nGo I gathered was some kind of ailing companion animal [noise]\nFriends you'll men said\nHow do you roll well spoke father we\nRoll well [noise] and now the old man ask the questions\n... sister how robust she [noise]\nThe assistance to their child thrive I hadn't paid them as breeders\nThose two [noise] she rolls well spoke father spoke father of a child is strong [noise]\n\nFrom my own heart I felt entirely invisible\nThese four were locked in some kind of devotional symbiosis and energy similar to but more powerful than that which the bread men enjoyed with his subjects\nIndeed I Wonder if I was observing the conceptual antecedent of the bread man fellowship the original too which is\nFired I briefly for God why we were all there [noise]\nThen with a deep satisfied sigh Anton turned and said\nSpoke father what may I offer you today\nTo focaccia [noise]\nExcellent the bread men said and he bent over the basket personally with drew the last two low [noise] slid them carefully into a paper sack while a girl assistance snatched up the empty vessel and whisk it away\n\nIt took me a moment to absorb what was happening [noise] which left me with little time to compose my objection nothing more time would necessarily have improved it I Am rhetorically limited even the most relaxed of circumstances\nNow wait a minute I sat all heads snapped up\nThey were clearly surprised to be reminded of my existence [noise]\nI'm here to specifically by my wife my sick wife some of that for gotcha I sat and I was here before this gentleman and he never signed in\nThey stared\nShow those lobes I continued borrowing a phrase from myself are rightfully mind to buy\nNo response are they not I added\nThe assistance exchanged alarmed glances the old man\nAppeared you to think on his face to face smile emerged and his eyes felt shocked he tipped his head back as though in anticipation of instructions from outer space [noise]\n\nBut he didn't speak [noise] instead it was the bread man who spoke he said\nAren't you cafes [noise]\nThe phrase was like I'd\nAnd scout I must have jerks slightly I raised my hand to rub the affected area trying to pass it off as casual Harris moving [noise]\nI Am married to caffeine yes I said she asked me to pick up some focaccia I pointed at my pocket which held my phone that was what Cathy lived on my phone [noise]\n\nYour bread men nodded [noise] not at what I said it seemed but at some unfathomable complex gain of interlocking events personalities of which I was could ever be\nOnly dimly in adequately aware he trained to ... look on me\nHe said\nCathy would understand [noise]\nBefore I had a chance to digest this extraordinary remarks the boy assistant stepped up beside me threatening to close his face was flush them slick and smell the sweat and wouldn't smoke she said the full ... old bones\nThen he withdrew from the sidelines where the mother of his child waited with a comforting half hug and whispered reassurances\nA dog is that\nOld bones is spoke fathers trusted friend the bread met explained he's in his last days now the ... are his favorite treat\nI turned to the old man hoping for some kind of clarification surely he wasn't going along with this nonsense\nBut he was still examining the happens to the insides of his eyelids send could not fearing [noise]\nOr you have a system I said that's my understanding it is very elaborate highly specific what's the point of having a system if somebody can just walk in here cut in line and circumvent it I signed the sheet I'm Mark my time\nThe boy assistance ... shook his head the bread man held out calming hand nodded then press his fingertips together\nHe leaned forward\nBut this is spoke father [noise]\n[laughter] I'm Sorry\nI replied with all due respect I don't know who who the hell that is I mean [noise] yeah is this guy but isn't this a business isn't this a publicly engaged small business aren't I a customer are you in the business of selling bread\nWe all think of it that way [noise]\nThe girl assistant his it's All right it's All right the bread men said no it's fine we forgive you for this misunderstanding [noise]\nI should've thrown the pie or at least done the thinking that lend to the throwing of the pie several weeks earlier than I did but it's very hard to throw a pie and someone when you're pregnant because you feel so vulnerable\nAlso let's face it I wasn't ready to throw the pie I should add that the pie\nWas hardly the first thing that I thought about throwing it mark but every other time I wanted to throw something at him I couldn't bring myself to do it\nOnce for example right after I found out about him and Selma I'd been seized by a violent impulse but the only thing I could see to throw at the time was assigned ... chair and\nI Am far to boost walk to throw a scientist haunted anything at any one [noise]\nSometime later especially while I was in the hospital I gave considerable thought to smashing march head in with a very good frying pan that I had bought at the bridge kitchenware company but I always knew that I Would never do anything of the sort and in any case\nSmashing your husband's head in with the frying pan seems slightly to fraud with feminist content if you know what I mean [noise] well even now\nI Wonder if I Would have thrown the pie if we'd been eating and Betty's dining room probably not on the floor and Betty's dining room is a beautiful oriental rug and I would have been far too concerned about gaining it\nFortunately though we were eating in the kitchen and the kitchen has a linoleum floor that is how bourgeois I Am\nAt the split seconds I picked up the pie to throw it at mark at the split second I was about to do the bravest all be at the most derivative thing that I've ever done in my life I thought to myself thank God the floors linoleum and can be wiped off [noise]\nUh on Saturday afternoon Betty called\nI went out for a walk to buy the pie ingredients I took Sam with me we had a long talk about how ... than you'll would be coming home from the hospital on Monday and how much Sam was going to love him and how he was going to feed them some delicious spiders\nAnd we bought food names it was a beautiful day so we decided to walk down to the toy store on M. street and on the way we pass the jewelry store where mark had bought me the diamond ring and\nI remember that I hadn't taken it in yet they haven't fixed it was in a little ... in my purse\nI could see Leo Rothman the owner sitting on a stool behind the counter Leo [noise] the deer white haired man who had merged with the Abraham Lincoln\nDepartment in the forties was now a millionaire jeweler who bust only white people through his electronically operated door [noise] she buys me in and gave me a big gifts when mark was courting main um when he was pursuing me with flowers and\nBalloons and Jules Leo was the man that mark bought the jewels from and as a result Leal failed own those\nProprietary about our marriage she and outfitted the courtship the wedding the birth of the first child the first child silver spoon\nAnd she didn't seem to mind that except for the diamond ring none of marks purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars [noise] I totally feel about the robbery and he said it would just take a minute to reset the stone\nSalmon I waited while he got\nOut his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much [noise] um she said did I Know the diamond in the ring was a perfect stone I said march told me that\nHe said it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble selling if I ever wanted to see and told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark had paid for it I said I was glad to hear that\nHe asked me how I liked the necklace [noise]\nThe necklace I said\n[noise] uh Leo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer he\nSaid no no no you're not I said I knew mark had bought me some thing while I was in the hospital\nSo he had bought her a necklace for her birthday I was lying\nIn the hospital with a nose and he had bought her\nA necklace no fat rascal\nI said oh I shouldn't have said anything real sag oh I'm Glad you did I said now\nI Know what to be prepared for there is nothing worse than opening a box with a necklace in it when you're\nI kept talking I couldn't stop once I said I was in the mood for an eye out and mark kept dropping hints about what he'd gotten me for my birthday and finally I said I don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\nWas my face red [laughter]\nLeo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang\nThe diamond caught the afternoon sun and made a rainbow on the wall of the store Sam ran to the reflection and I waved to ring this way and that moving the rainbow while she giggled and left\nAnd tried to catch it in his hands\nHow much I said\nOh no charge Leo said you know how much for the ring\nI said how much would you give me for the ring\nLeo looked at me um you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it I said do you really want to buy it oh of\nCourse he said oh I Love the ring Leo but it really just doesn't go with my life\nWould never have been stolen in the first place if I hadn't been born this way and if you got a ring you can't wear on this\nI mean coat [noise] if I had a mean coach I Would have to take every time I'm In New York and the next thing you know we'd be even brokered than we are now mark is so romantic he probably spent every penny of his savings on the necklace [laughter]\nLeo nodded for the down payment you said for the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo [noise] now have a beautiful necklace I won't be able to wear on the subway either I said\nHow much for the ring Fifteen thousand Leo said Fifteen thousand I said that's what mark paid for it they'll set in my heart started ... pounds\nI realized that I had just been given the means to walk out of my marriage Fifteen thousand it is\nI said to Leo ten years had passed the cost of walking out of a marriage had gone up\nI went home with Leo's checks and made the pie I was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trance but it was a close to his Tran says I'll ever get I was\nSpeechless I said nothing nothing at all for several hours [noise] at age I'm Mark and I took the pie ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with [noise]\nWhen we got to Betty's mark and Dimitri went into the kitchen to boil the lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while\nBut he talked about the dance that she in Selma and I were apparently giving apparently we were giving it at the sole grave club apparently the crap man had already been booked apparently all that was lacking\nBut my guess list film and Betty had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger ers were on film is list\nJust as I predicted\nI sat and listens and drank an entire bottle of white wine as bad he went on and on and\nBy the time they just you know I was chip see we ate the lobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise]\nUm I Do remember realizing that no one seemed to be noticing that I hadn't said anything the entire evening and that no one seemed to mind\nI must try this again I thought I must try again someday to sit still and not say a word maybe when I'm dead [noise]\nAfter the lobsters I took sticky line pie out of the freezer and put the whipped cream on it and sat it in front of me\nI was going to give it five minutes to thaw slightly see recipe [noise] and that's when he turned to me and she said Rachel you didn't tell me about Richard and Helen what about Richard ... said mark what they're getting a divorce said Betty\nI bumped into him this week in New York I always hated that woman said mark my ... said Dmitri when
