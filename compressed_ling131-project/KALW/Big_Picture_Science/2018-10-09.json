cats rats would you start looking you wanna [noise] rabbits and fans at a low shark spiders toads I mean they're all animals\nWe conveniently forget that humans are in that list too we are also animals however we observe the amusing the terrifying the occasionally odd behavior of other creatures\nAs if they inhabit a biosphere that is separate from our civilized own\nAs a result some of our observations about animals how ever well intentioned as superficial and you don't have to be clever as a Fox to recite a few popular tropes like quiet as a most dumb as an ox and that sneaky weasel\nRight that's right if I had an elephant's memory I could do better than say bloodthirsty batter brave it's a lion but enough wanting around the point is we make easy assumptions about animals based on their appearance or some aspect of their\nBehavior and as humans who conveniently forget their animals we want to be accepted and appreciated for who we really are this means taking time to understand the context of what seems like bizarre behavior for example let's say we hear a guy screams\n... sandwich and then he throws a jelly sandwich at someone\nHim to a casual observer that guy's nuts and then you find out that he works for ... deli thanks for Jews and Reagan for all your daily nice\nYou just want to find it in a cage together that it ain't gonna work so that's how a sense that we can't really understand smell that communication that send to communication means nothing to offer and say we don't understand it and we misinterpreted animals as a result\nI Can't recall who wrote this but somebody said something to the effect that animals don't just live in a different world they inhabit a different universe is that really true\nYeah yeah I think that's a great quote we see well we have well off and just not as I K but different animals have heightened senses or other senses the less well developed and so yeah they sensory realm as is very very very different from our house and say\nIt's really hard for us to put ourselves in the shoes and to try and walk out what's going on\nWell finally Lucy or we tend to stereotype our fauna friends although I guess calling

recoil from it we might not be motivated to care about that animal and a conservative habitat for example in the case of the vulture\nAnd more than that we don't understand why they're doing it I mean the animals are not deliberately be gross or anything like that that's their lifestyle and there's got to be a reason for it because otherwise we wouldn't be around doing it so we've got to resist the temptation to you know consider their behavior in the same terms that you would consider that somebody invited to dinner\n[laughter] that's true animal behavior is complicated and remember that humans

documentary film\nRodents of unusual size\nBut as the film describes there's more to this story because of the nutrients are not a typical invasive species they were purposely introduced brought here

about humans and so while there are a lot of them and their invasive to Louisiana they'll kind of scatter off when you get nearby\nMy goodness I write a nutrient is a rodent right so what are its closest relatives I mean it's also known as a swamp rabbit so I presume it's related to ... uh tell me about you know closely related critters\nSo new tree or rodents they're closer to things like copy bears and beavers than the kind of normal rats that we think about\nA lot of people confused copy bars in nutrients ... bars are the largest rodent in the world but they're much cuter in coffee bars actually have kind of for regular legs where as nutrient looks more like a rat\nThey're semi aquatic animals there are ... in the sense that they only vegetation particularly route\nMost nutri or maybe about Fifteen to twenty pounds but one of the big problems that they have to be an invasive species of the breed really quickly so like within three months four months you know baby can start reproducing and they have litters of sixty babies and so you can imagine that they're more prolific than rabbits\nAnd what about their teeth I read that they have read teeth kind of reminds me of a I don't know a vampire\nMe [laughter] well while we consider nutri kind of cute once you get up close and personal from far away they kind of have this kind of horror movie look in the sense that they're you know look like the super size giant rat\nBut they do have these giant front orange teeth the teeth or orange because they feast on route and the roots are rich and iron into the iron basically manifests themselves an orange teeth that you see some people are actually making jewelry out of them in Louisiana\nWe've labeled termites as tests for\nGood reason termites can eat wood grass money they can eat books worldwide they do at least forty billion dollars worth of damage a year [noise]\nTermites have excellent immune systems they have internal immune systems and they also have a social immune system that is enforced by soldiers they also have another kind of social immune system which is that they spread their feces about\nThey groom each other obsessively the result is that it's extremely hard to kill termites with biological agents\nNow what happens next is that we're about to make the case for the virtues of the term I so we ask that you clear from your mind images of amounts of would be it's fine to wall board in your basement or the ragged holes in your prize book collection and prepare yourself for\nUnder bug an obsessive tale of termites and technology reporter Lisa ... book about the upside of this under bug\nShe spent eight years studying termites with researchers from a wide array of scientific and technological fields and learn that despite being publicly maligned termites or central contributors to the planet's environmental health\nAnd they're even pointing their literal antennae toward the exciting future technology okay Lisa we want to hear more about that but first what's the most impressive thing that you've seen termites much their way through\nI Would have to say the most impressive thing it's probably some sort of power system insulator um where I saw this what if not would though I'm I Know well [laughter] [laughter]\nThey're also capable of eating other things so in Australia people talk about the meeting tires they eat the coating on wires\nAnd uh I happen to be visiting Berlin and someone who worked at a government lab that was formerly in East Berlin took me into their basement where they had different colonies of termites that they've had for\nA Thirty years or so each growing in kind of of that I'm In temperature control rooms and they have these to test different industrial materials on them\nSo they would take like a whole intact insulator of some sort or transformer case and they would jam it down into the vat of termites and they leave it for a month or so and then they would pull it out\nAnd what remained what the termites had not chewed away would look like a sculpture because the termites had been gnawing away on the sides of it in sort of strange organic patterns really\nWe do have to overcome our disposition not to like termites to prepare ourselves to here in what ways termites or beneficial\nThink there's two things one thing is is to watch a collection of termites\nIf watching aunts or other insects grosses you out which it does me I feel itchy when I look at ... I don't feel that when I look at termites ants move in a very a sort of ... by the judge did weigh termites slow\nAnd to me they're not as disturbing to actually watch\nAnd then the second thing is I Would say termites have an extraordinary aesthetic\nWhen they're building a mound that can be say Fifteen feet tall they feel inside of it with their antennas defined rough areas and wherever it's rough they pull away the dirt until it's smooth and so when you open up a termite mound it's this\nExtraordinary world with these very smooth beautiful interior spaces and I think if you look close\nNow when they're making their their mound why did they making them out of and what does the material that the results\nWill different termites build in different environments so the termites that I watch for the longest time we're macro attorneys Madeleine says and they were in Namibia and they build with little balls of mud which they making their mouths and the mud is\nSomewhat cemented with some kind of special termites saliva\nAnd we don't know exactly how they built\nBut a basic description of it is that one term I Will put down one dirt ball and another term I Will put down another dirt ball and top of that and then they keep piling up the dirt ball until they have like little peaks and then those little peaks kind of connect to make frilly little walls\nAnd then those walls some of them have arches in them they begin to build up and one of the things that we know drives them is the smell of fresh air inside their mound it smells really intensely of termites smells really intensely a fungus\nAnd of course there's all this feces and they're constantly transferring microbial sort of starter culture to each other by mouth to mouth and melted but [noise]\nSo there's this intense smell in there and when any fresh air comes through some termites run from the fresh air into the mound and set off an alarm of sort of us that they make a sound and then other termites grab a dirt ball they build and build until they've cut off the fresh air smell\nSo just to be clear the fresh air is not something they're drawn to the way that we are when we want to step out of our buildings and get some fresh air the fresh air suggests is that there may be holes are vulnerabilities in their defense system\nYes if you're a termite you're constantly being attacked by aunts and aunt eaters an art barks an art wolves and anything else that can hack their way into your\nInto your mound so one of the things that you do if you're a termite is you you know how to control your perimeter and the way that they do that is that when they smell fresh air they know they need to go do something\nWhat what is the reason for these complex structures though I mean they could probably just make a very simple mound I mean maybe I I Would say maybe like an ... mountain but perhaps that's not simple either so I shouldn't say that\nThe lie so a lab or it almost like a like a palace an insects version of a beautiful palace well\nIt's always an interesting question of why something that evolutionarily drive to like a bug\nIs building something so elaborate like amount or the particularly these uh ... mountains in Namibia I'm we know that the mound itself has several functions one of them is that it works kind of like a long it manages to both protect them from wind and cold\nYou know keeps moisture in it keeps too much rain out when it's really wet it makes the air fresh it also keeps too much fresh air from coming in and it also regulates the temperature", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
