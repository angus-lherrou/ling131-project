I'm only deadly welcome to big picture science produced at the SETI Institute where researchers investigate\nTo major in origin of life in this episode we step back and get the wide angle view of the culture of science and technology [noise] we've been hearing about harassment and barriers to women seeking careers in politics and entertainment but what about in scientific fields science is supposed to be uniquely merit based in objective and yet\nThe data say otherwise as an example a new survey reveals widespread harassment of women of color in space\nScience meanwhile it's not Nineteen fifty anymore but apparently someone at Google didn't get the memo\nAn engineer for the tech giant claims that women don't have the right kind of brains to do his job find out what the scientific studies say plus how one woman blazed the trail and astronomy despite the barriers and an organization that is changing the face of science for Latina and Native American\nIt's exceed and this episode wonder women\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nScript rebellion and American biochemist once said I hadn't been aware that there were doors close to me until I started knocking on them Dr alien was born in Nineteen Eighteen and knocked on a lot of doors on the way to winning her Nobel Prize in Nineteen\nEighty eight it's a familiar tale for any woman who was pursued a career in science\nAstronomer Jill Tarter also pounded out a lot of doors on her way to becoming a pioneer in her field as a young girl she had a nonstop curiosity about technology but growing up in the Nineteen fifties she found ... encourage meant for these interests she kept knocking on doors anyway\nThe gender symmetry didn't change much when she went to college Dr Tarter was the only woman in an engineering class of three hundred and went on to become one of the few females working in astronomy and eventually the field of set the the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nAnd all of these pursuits Jill Tarter had to forge her own path\nIf you've seen the movie contact you know something about Dr Tarter single minded efforts to listen for radio signals from alien life signals that she has convinced or raining down on us from distant\nWorlds we're talking about vast distances between the stars\nSo what can we remotely sense that might indicate a technology somewhere else radio travels all the way through the galaxy\nBetween galaxies no problem we've never seen the center of our galaxy at optical wavelengths because there's too much dust but we have incredibly good observations of the center of our galaxy at radio wavelengths\nNow the movie contacts iconic image of Jodi foster wearing a pair of earphones sitting alone next to an array of radio antennas is a bit of poetic license is Dr Tarter she doesn't actually search for signals by listening with a headset but\nAnd because of the cultural norm they don't expect a woman to start talking about specifications and the details of the engineering and it was suddenly oh gee didn't expect to hear that\nMaybe we should listen to her so by simply showing and showing off sometimes that I was a lot smarter than they were with respect to the field that I was working and I could gain attention and I did for whatever it took\nThe question is always implied with you but I'll just ask it straight out says you've been doing this for a long time\nAre we alone in the universe is are we alone I don't know the answer the question of that's why we're doing steady that's why we're doing experiments observations to try and find out the answer when I was a student we knew\nLife at least intelligent technology logical life\nCouldn't live in very extreme environments had to be between the boiling and freezing points of water had to be neutral can be very acidic or very basic\nAnd that's all know that exploded now that we've been studying extremophiles I mean who would've expected to find life kilometers down into the crust which we do\nLive finds a way in all kinds of environment\nLife finds a way and so that's the story over my career has been\nThat the universe has appeared to be more bio friendly than when I started out it doesn't mean it is we haven't proven that that appearances actually translate into reality but I think we will in this century\nWell and and finally Jill I'm what does it mean that you have not found aliens so far in terms of how you sustain yourself psychologically in other words what's it like to work on a program that you may never have an answer for it\n[noise] when I started in this exploration I think I understood fairly well how big a question it was that I was trying to answer and that I might not find an answer\nBy the end of my life but it might be my granddaughter or her granddaughter that eventually succeeds Jill Tarter thank you so much for joining us today oh Molly it's been a pleasure thanks for having me\n[noise]\nJoe ... or one of the founding members of the SETI Institute where she's now on the board of trustees she is the subject of a book by writers ... schools making contact Jill Tarter and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence [noise]\nThe ranks of women astronomers have been growing Jill Tarter took an engineering class according to a study by the American Institute of physics about one third of those who get a bachelor's in astronomy work astrophysics far women in science she checked more women are getting to a degree\nBut not necessarily the job for no longer living in the era of Nineteen fifties stereotype but someone in the Silicon Valley didn't get the\nNext are women's brains just not suited for tech it's wonder women on the picture science\nMichigan this American Life like sprint Camille

and on your smart speaker say play KLW\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThings have changed since the days when astronomers Jill Tarter was the only woman in her engineering class at Cornell University according to the national Science Foundation the ballots his tipped towards greater equality when it comes to degrees earned as well as job placement in most\nSTEM fields that is science technology engineering and math\nThe exception is the e in stem men continue to seriously a number of women in engineering and computer science why is this a memo written by Google software engineer suggests one reason the culture is hostile to women\nThe memo was meant to be shared internally but it was released publically and it struck a nerve both in and outside the walls of the tech giant it reinforce the image of the Silicon Valley as the segregated valley\nThe tech companies have been criticized for lack of diversity in hiring women account for thirty one percent of Google's workforce but just twenty percent of its technical staff according to the company's own diversity reports\nAnd while employment in IT field is going by thirty seven percent since two thousand three the percentage of women in engineering hasn't changed it's flat at Thirteen protect\nAnd the percentage of women working in computer science has actually down since Nineteen Ninety\nThe Google memo was written in twenty Seventeen but the thinking was borrowed from another era where there were men's jobs and women's jobs\nWell they don't get ... they can become dressmaker kept people the barber shop can't can't can't gun stuff [laughter] well the danger of doctors and lawyers to you know there are judges and lawyers are\nA stubborn imbalance of women in tech but because they claim that there was science supporting it men's brains are more suited than women's protect jobs\nScience journalist Angela ... says this is a persistent myth and people are not looking at current research how science got women wrong writes missing in her book inferior she addresses the software engineers misguided memo\nSo it wasn't as though he explicitly said that women are biologically less capable of doing the job but he certainly heavily imply that so within his memo he used this kind of biological argument that because of testosterone levels early and development that women are somehow have\nDifferent capabilities are different preferences to men\nUnderlying a tool the documents that he used come from various thesis research but one of them in particular is work done by a researcher here at Cambridge University Simon Baron Cohen\nNow he is a very well respected world famous autism are such a but well the parts of the hits were such as more controversial is on sex differences so he claims that there are such things as distinct male female brains\nAnd that they predispose\nThe people who possesses male female brains to slightly different interests and hobbies and this Google engineer drew his kind of inspiration from this although I have to say that having such a topic in great great detail for a number of years\nThis theory itself and Valentine's Day we doesn't really have a great deal of evidence behind it\nWhat let me just follow review on what his point was I mean it may be that there's\nA some tendency you know the the leads to a difference in behavior in a technical environment between men and women I don't know but on the other hand is usually what the cases is that there's so much overlap and these capabilities that shouldn't really affect the number of\nFemale engineers I mean what what was he tried to get out here\n[noise] yes absolutely this is where it gets complicated because there is lots of research on sex differences is one of the most fashionable fields in science right now and there was such really can tell you whatever you wanted to tell you depending on which study you happen to pick up\nIf you take any group of people and divided down the middle you will find differences between them and thoughts of product to the fact that we are all different as individuals and in fact there's far more differences within the sexes and they're all between them you know we're just so different\nAnd this is why the complication comes and\n\nOne of the barriers to women pursuing careers in science and technology is a climate that his subtly unwelcome ain't poor worse harassment of women and space science and astronomy has been in the news and gotten our attention but some researchers suspected that was more to the story as big as it was\nThey wanted to quantify other alarming anecdotes that they were hearing associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois captain Clancy and colleagues surveyed more than four hundred astronomers and planetary scientists with questions of their experience in the workplace over the last five years but this survey was unique\nWe focused our attention on the experiences of women of color because women of color face a double bind and we wanted to see the extent to which we could see that in the sciences\nThe researchers asked the women about eight different issues related to identity gender gender identity race sexuality physical ability mental ability narrow diversity that is variations in neurological conditions and religion\nAnd we asked the extent to which they had overheard disparaging remarks about these kinds of identities to the extent to which state experienced verbal and physical harassment as a result of these identities\nAnd then whether or not they'd ever felt unsafe in their workplace and finally whether or not they'd ever skipped professional event due to feeling unsafe\nThe result was the paper coauthored by Dr Clancy double jeopardy and astronomy and planetary science women of color face greater risks of gender and racial harassment published in the summer of twenty Seventeen in the journal of geophysical research planet\nThe results may have been given less attention at the time then they deserved because they were published in a niche journal but the implications are as broad as they are sobering our main\nFindings where is that women of color experienced a the greatest degrees of verbal and physical harassment even more so than white women that they felt unsafe in their workplace and extraordinarily high numbers\nForty percent of the women of color in our sample so that they felt unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender and you know that was a really devastating up for us and then of course the number of women or women of color and white women reported that they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe what\nYour reaction to the results of your survey and from one account I read that you were devastated and I wonder if you could expand on that because women and women of color have reported this sort of behavior\nAs a complete surprise [noise] no um\nI mean the thing is is that none of this work that I've been doing for the last five years has ever surprise me you know it's not that a single time I've seen data and been like oh I had no\nIdea that women of color were going to experience and greater degree uses\nHarassment um instead what I think it is is there's there's something about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them\nBut it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe [noise] how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it\nWe didn't define it we just ask them to what you know have you ever felt unsafe in your workplace and have you ever skipped any professional events because you felt unsafe and so that certainly leaves it open for responding to interpret that term however they like you know the\nWay I might interpret it might be different from the way you read it but either way I think it's going to be a pretty negative workplace experience if you could ever label what you're experiencing as unsafe\nYou use the term in your abstract micro aggressions and I wonder if you distinguish between micro aggressions at one experiences in the workplace and a blunt hostile remark an actual physical aggression\nSo micro aggressions are really about different types of incivility Z\nOr unpleasant interactions you may have in the workplace that are clearly a result of your identity and usually specifically a result of your race that's really where the term I Believe originally came from is understanding racial micro aggressions so someone might say something that I'm very subtly racially motivated\nLike making a comment about oh how often do you actually wash your hair to an African American person or a or else actually I'll tell you one that I I Know happened here on my campus because uh a lecture told me about an a student at first telling her about it\nIs that uh there was this one African American woman and a lecture hall she was one of the only African American women in the entire chemistry class and she could hear a couple of white men behind her giggling\nAnd couldn't figure out why and then at the end of the class realize they had stuck a pen in her hair [noise]\nUm you know and she had sort of an afro and it was a a department of chemistry Penn so it was like a let's make it as obvious as possible that you are not welcome here that we find something other and weird about you\nWhat was heartbreaking truly in and you identify this was reading that I'm Eighteen percent of women of color and twelve percent of women\nJust skipped out on a professional meetings on seminars and other events that they would otherwise go to because they wanted to avoid this hostile climate that it's so bad that you [laughter]\nThat you avoid doing the thing that you love and participating in your field in and collaborating with your your colleagues because you don't know how you're going to be treated in that meeting\nExactly and you don't want to be reminded of you know the person who made a pass at you at lunch or the person who made you feel smaller made you feel stupid so you miss out on that seminar you miss out on the chance to meet you know the senior colleague who does the work that you do\nUm or a chance to bond with some of your friends or or a chance to just learn something new and exciting you know um and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or\nOne of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all were present in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to John in me because I Want it to be in a less hostile discipline\n[laughter] and so I mean that makes me think that physics might actually be even worse than astronomy in terms of how hostile it is or just how intimidating that workplace can feel\nWorkplace aggression and sexual harassment in the workplace they're not new but you found that people did not expect to find them present in the sciences as well and why would people think that the sciences would be immune to aggression and sexual harassment\nShort and this is one of the things that I find frustrating sometimes in fact as someone who's both a ... a social scientist and a trained like scientists because I'm a biological anthropology I'm always surprised when I encounter a scientist from other disciplines\nWho are incredibly staunch believers that science is a meritocracy that the best people who do science are the ones who stay in science and they're the ones who succeed in science they're the ones who get the best papers and the best funding\nAnd they just couldn't be further from the truth I mean what really matters in science is your pedigree what matters unfortunately it's often your identity or the number of African American female post stocks that I've known over the last five to seven years\nWho um end up on every shortlist that they go up you know when they go up for jobs and then are always there's always a white man chosen over them and it's always they're always told afterwards oh well you interviewed really well but this other person was just a better fit for our department\nYou know these are extraordinary scientists that I'm Talking about who aren't getting these jobs so it's not that they're not good enough right they're getting the interviews\nI really think that scientists have to start paying closer attention to issues of implicit bias\nAnd interrogating this notion of meritocracy a little bit more and like stop that just really think we need to stop deluding ourselves that everything works out for a reason or that everything is fair and our field 'cause it's not that way in any workplace\nAnd only knowledge that that's when we actually can start to raise them consciousness around it and actually affect change\nCaptain plenty thank you so much for speaking with us thank you\nGathering Clancy use an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois\nOne group is fighting the unwelcome in scientific culture by working to diversify it for both women and men hello my name is ... I'm the executive director of ...\n... is the society for the advancement of Chicanos Hispanics Native Americans in science\nAnd this is what they're up against for science technology and engineering jobs the majority are held by whites six percent are held by Hispanics and only point two percent are held by Native Americans\nThe members of softness provide training at conferences that are multi disciplinary multicultural and growing in popularity the unofficial motto a sock and that's when it comes to minorities pursuing careers in science", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
