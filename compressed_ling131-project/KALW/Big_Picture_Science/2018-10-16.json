S. S. the international space station\nFor a year you know as an astronaut your job is to not only applied vehicle and you know operate the hardware fish but it's also should be [noise] you know it's mental subject I think\nIt became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed\nAnd so obviously the expression of the gene is like the when you read the book of life\nIs what is really active form of genetic code versus just losing a whole page from your book of life which is what kind of some of the headlines looked like for a little while they're really exciting thing though is that we know of a shortlist of genes to keep an eye on for future astronaut that seemed to change when you're up there and and don't go back right away\nYou know if he'd come back a different species of if he went up a man and and and came back a turtle I mean that would have been you know dismaying for his wife I Would I Would think\nYeah yeah he would you know we get a less applicants to the astronaut program\nAnd Christopher Mason thanks very much for speaking with us great thank you my pleasure\nChristopher Mason is an associate professor of genetics in computational biology at Weill Cornell medicine and now a decidedly earth found astronaut reaction to being a lab rat in space\nScott it sounds like a year in some sort of conveying it's are you in a car somewhere\nIn a spaceship going to Mars [laughter] no actually\nI'm In a a I think it's a suburban heading to the island Ga I Wish I was on his racial\n[laughter] now when you came back to earth and you heard about these epigenetic changes what was your reaction to hearing about that stuff\nYeah I don't know you know it's it's something that you know is not symptomatic\nI Can't feel it it's interesting information for me\nAnd what about the telomeres because unlike what normally happens or you know as you get older your telomeres shorten you know did you did you notice that at least that you say wow I feel Twenty years younger or something [noise]\nNo [laughter] no but uh you know I tell them airs apparently in space got better but you know with a couple of months after I got on the\nFactory where they were briefly knocked the fountain of youth\n[laughter] but that's disappointing well finally than Scott you know you come back to earth and at least for a while some of your DNA has been altered did you feel like you didn't have an identical twin during that period\nI Hope so but when I see him impersonate looks somewhat similar may show I guess not\n[laughter] well Scott thanks very much\nAll right take care of\nCaptain Scott Kelly is a former military test pilot and astronaut what fascinates you about this study well I think it's interesting to me simply\nBecause of the immediate applicability\nTo the human exploration of the solar system I mean you know\nWe we we go to Mars we go to the moons of Jupiter we go all over the solar system every night on my TV\nBut one of the big unknowns is how good an idea is that is that going to affect the health of the crew members in ways that we haven't yet learned about so you know this this study bears on that TV show are you watching that travels all over the\nSolar system just about any ... show on the air and there always are plenty of them\nWell it's wild stuff that as we heard the changes the astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA were mostly\nThe story gets even weirder with the suggestion that at the genetic changes can be inherited in other words\nThe consequences of behavior could be passed down to the next generation\nIt's ... days not destiny on big picture science [noise]\n[noise] ... five will remember the Olympic black power salute fifty years later with one of the men who raised his staff John Carlos\nPeople say you sound like you used to run a sound that you still got the fire was the flowers wouldn't me when I came to find new when I left and Joe justice is ... ... all men women and children when the last\nFifty years since the Olympics black power salute today at five on cross currents from KLW needed [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe results of the NASA twin study are only relevant the astronauts there yet more evidence that everyone's DNA is subject to sometimes dramatic a modification by our environment\nScott Kelly's DNA reverted to his pre flight chemistry when he returned to earth and it's our understanding that epigenetic changes accumulated over a lifetime are erased the Ford genes attached to a new generation\nBut we aren't certain of that research on non human species suggests that at least some of the changes can be passed down\nReporter Carl Zimmer whose latest book is on the science of heredity describes those studies and what the NASA twin studies says and does it say about changes do astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA\nYeah so what is happening in a study like that is that the actual a sequence of letters in Scott's genes is not being rewritten by being in space\nBut when scientists look at his cells before and after and compare them to his brother marks they can see that there are epigenetic differences they can see that the pattern of molecules around his DNA seems to be different in some regards than it was before\nNow in some cases and then maybe it would be in the case of Scott's if some genes are turned on and they're turned off due to environmental factors could those changes in those genes or the activation or the dorm at state of his genes be passed on to another generation\nAh well that is a very big controversy I'm so this is something called a trans generational epigenetic inheritance nice big craze\nPerson or some other species has\nAlters the genetics and theirselves that includes germs cells in other words agents from that that can then produce the next generation and that next generation the idea goes can inherit the epigenetic changes along with the genes\nAnd so there are lots of really good compelling examples in nature that this can indeed happen or they just don't really include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant\nAnd mining its own business and it gets attacked by some insects\nSo plants switch on a bunch of genes when they sense this sort of attack and they produce a bunch of chemicals that the hope is quote unquote to drive off the insects or at least sort of minimize their attack\nPlants that experience an attack from insects or or pathogens\nThey will produce seeds and if the when those seeds grow into new plants they will actually respond faster to these kinds of attacks than they would have otherwise like they have a memory yeah\nAnd the same is true of the seeds that you produce from those plants um and so you that seems to go through several generations with plants\nWell here's a blue sky question you're ready actually it's higher than blue skies [laughter] at the [noise]\nThe orbit of the international space station let's say that Scott had fathered a child in space when he was his molecules are undergoing these changes is it possible that anything that has changed in ... we say is DNA did not change but any of these epigenetic factors could have been passed down to this child\nThere's no evidence from humans that it could have and part of that reason for that is that it seems that\nPlant biology and animal biology are very different and the way that epigenetics is controlled in both kinds of organisms is different and so in humans during that process of an embryo developing producing its own eggs or sperm\nA lot of those epigenetic marks that may have accumulated in one's lifetime get stripped away in those cells and then I sort of a baseline set of epigenetic marks or put back in place\nSo in a way it's kind of like a racing memory in every generation that doesn't necessarily totally closed the door I epigenetics in as an a kind of read it in humans there might be other molecules\nThat can also carry this kind of epigenetic inheritance forward and scientists are looking into these and and there are some studies on mice that are really intriguing and really thought provoking and my step closer to humans than plants are they are and so they exactly and so there there are these studies in mice\nThey will not make it to the next generation in that particular case as far as we know now turns out though that nutrition probably affects your DNA and can pass on\nIn some ways that we don't fully understand that it as an example when in the city of St Petersburg during World War two lots of people starved\nAnd actually people came out short for generations after that and there are other examples of this as well that's thought to happen by DNA modification and in fact there's another interesting example I can tell you about which is\nIn Guyana you can actually look at when kids are conceived not when they're born but when they're ... which is nine months before when they're born\nAnd it turns out that kids conceived in the rainy season\nCome out different in height and build than those in the dry season those in the dry season the parents had better nutrition the mom in particular and so the kids come out a little bit healthier in a little bit bigger and it's also the case they have differences in their modify DNA\nSo that as I say nutrition actually does affect the modification of your DNA now exactly how that makes you bigger and healthier we don't understand and that's thought to be able to pass and the next generation's\nLike I said this is astounding because this is this sounds like I don't know ... in evolution this sounds like the stories you know that they believed a two hundred years ago that giraffes just stretch their next a little bit and so baby giraffes have longer next I mean I thought that that was long gone that idea\nWell I I think most of the more permanent things like giraffes probably are genetically controlled or or how much has influenced by ... genetics isn't fully understood but it is fair there are epigenetic in fact most of them don't pass generation or so it's thought we don't fully understand very active area of research\nBut it's pretty clear that epigenetics does affect you I mean you and now it's actually it turns out that believe it or not\nAs you age or DNA modifies as well in fact you can tell how old someone is from the modifications in their DNA\nMy goodness All right well don't look in mind set\nBy the way that does not pass the next generation some modifications in your DNA that are are associated with your age they will not pass on to the next generation that clock reset so when you start out as a baby you are baby\nI think you don't get born it's a it's an old conjure [laughter] no no not at all you know we talk about controlling future generations by modifying DNA I mean this was in ... when the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't too expensive I don't know but this sounds like you could do things by you know just\nTown that I mean is that truly does it go that far\nYeah that's not so clear I mean again it's a very poorly understood area and that's why a lot of people are working on it it's very very clear that the nutrition on other health of a pregnant mom\nHas a huge influence on the unborn fetus so that she pregnant women need to take care of themselves obviously and you're not here how they shouldn't smoke and drink alcohol those are very very ill effects\nNow to what extent they wind up modifying the DNA\nOf the fetus is not so clear but it is very likely that is the case so I Would argue that that's a huge and very important developmental time\nAnd in fact there's an area called preterm birth babies are born to early can have significant health problems and and that often happens because of issues associated with environment so pregnant women who live in poor areas have a much higher incidence of preterm birth\nAnd it's not because they're not necessarily giving good nutrition and such to their kids\nThe child will not develop properly and and maybe get worn early and that does have serious health consequences\nAnd so it's plausible we don't know for sure but it seems very likely that some of that will be up and genetic then those kids that are born earlier could modify DNA that's a little bit different than those of others so environment does have a big effect\nMichael Snyder thanks very much for speaking with us thanks for having me here\nMichael Snyder is the chair of the genetics department and the director of the center for genetics and precision medicine at Stanford University\nThe [noise]\nThe at
