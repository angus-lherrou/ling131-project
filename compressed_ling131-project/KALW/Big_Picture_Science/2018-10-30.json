A. O. W. dot O. R. G. [noise]\n\nWe're talking about non human communication in this episode of big picture science there's a lot of it going on but will miss it unless we take the time and develop the tools to study the messaging system of other species\nSimon ... is a professor in the botany department at the University of Wisconsin Madison as a research scientist who studies how plant sense and respond to the world is experiments are designed to produce quantitative data but for as how he feels about his subjects he's not neutral\nI teach in introductory biology class on plant biology and we start off which I'm going to tell you why plants are eleven on the one time scale of awesome [noise] if you're not\nAnimal kingdom not this island clear if they'll produce the world\nBut that particular Denver and in the corner all it's more like you then you know\nPlants have exactly the same problems that we have the sometimes the world is not a nice place to be\n[noise]\nAnd if a plant speeding eaten it doesn't have the luxury of running away\nBut that doesn't mean it's without options plants are good at producing chemicals so they can make toxins or something that tastes bad to act as a deterrent\nAnd now we have some insight literally how they do this in order to understand how chemical signals travel throughout a plant Dr Gilroy and his team engineered some plants the floor is when attacked that's right they light up\nThe reason the plants are glowing green is because we took a gene from a jellyfish gene makes a protein that naturally glows green\nAnd then they would watch under a microscope how the plant response to a threat such as being besieged by a fuzzy six legged tear\nThe capitalist thoughts chewing on the leaf and you mentioned the leaf is made up of thousands and thousands of cells and those those are being broken open by the caterpillar munching on that [noise] and that is a really big stress\nThey did one more thing in order to watch what happens next that is to the poor plant being attacked they engineered it said that the fluorescent protein is switched on in the presence of a substance within the cell called the calcium iron when the calcium levels go up the plant glows brightly\nCalcium spikes increases in ... levels within a sell carry information and trigger things and so one of the great examples of that is the reason that your heart is beating at the moment is because within the muscle cells with the hot\nThere were ... spikes of calcium being produced and the cops and levels go up and that triggers a muscle contraction and then the cost some levels go down and the muscles relax so that cow some changes triggering the biology of your hot\nThat theme is carried through biology so same deal with once they have spikes of couch him to go up and down inside the cells 'em loose trigger the downstream responses\n[noise]\nAnd so the plants start to glow bright green at the location where the damages occurring but then researchers we're in for a surprise\nIt was really sort of unexpected when we saw it so\nYou know if you pick up a leaf in the fall and look at it you can see all the veins across the leaf those veins the plumbing system of the plant\nI'm In the plants are engineer plants that glow in response to the signals we see that that plumbing system lights up in a wave moves through the plot and this was the super exciting I'm really unexpected but it moves down through all of that plumbing that vascular system\nAnd then goes pasta shoot an out into the leaves\nAnd this isn't like this time lapse videos showing plants slowly turning in the sun or opening their leaves these chemical signals move fast\nAnd it it's all in real time so we can watch the globe progress through the plant we can see where it goes so it's letting us really for the first time visualize this information moving in real time fruit the plot\nSo it's clear that plants have a complex internal signaling system\nOne part of the plant can send signals to another part of the plant it tell us what's going on so the more that Simon Gilroy and his team learn about plant communication the more impressed they become because well for one the plant signaling doesn't stop at the leaves edge plants have buddies\nAnd there's also some really elegant and just very nice experimentation that says that an individual pond can send information to another individual plot things like when an insect is chewing on the leaves of one plant volatile chemicals released on those chemicals blowing the wind\nAnd it perceives that volatile chemical and it will switch on its own defenses so this clearly information flowing both within the organism but also between organisms\nYou didn't contradict me and my uses the word communicated ... matter us demand picks to which\nHere [laughter] we can say that plants communicate\nYeah communication is information exchange\nI'm we're never going to use the language that we used to describe how human beings how we operate as far as taking in information and processing it when we're talking about plants because that's the realm that we understand and did you have in the back of your mind slip clumps clearly not animals ... green animals they're going to do things a little bit differently\nBut I don't think there's a problem and using the language to try and an ... what they're doing\nWell I think this question will be on some people's mind is the plant feeling pain when that caterpillar jumps down on it\nSued that\nKind of depends on what you think pain really means so there is clearly\nThey signal being generated so the receptors for wounding an damage of being ... good and there's information which is being passed to the rest of the organism this guys will be for the rest of the plant to trigger responses which has sort of the defense response is the way of dealing with that\nAbsolute immediate damage or there's no brain and there's no nervous system and so we usually think of the processing of the feeling of pain requires that processing component to it on those structures don't exist in plants\nSo that's not a definite no\n[laughter] [noise] um [noise] I Can't I think again it just gets down to we inevitably use the language of how humans perceive the world and how we process information on what happens to us\nTo put other organisms and complex and I think that is an absolutely appropriate thing to do because how else are we going to think about how these things operate so this damage this information on this response\nOr any of that pain that gets down to what you think your definition of pain is\nSimon do you own any pets\nOh absolutely yeah couple of cats\nWould you ever bite down on your cat's leg\n[noise] no\nI Know better than to do that [laughter] but you know\nThat would create a lot of pain for your cat so yeah and young if when you're working with plants if you ever hesitate if you have any regrets in what you need to do to them to test their receptors because they need to be damaged in some way and and do you ever pause and wonder if he should do it\nIf you could adopt one sensory system that a plant has for a day\n[laughter] which would it be\nRight that's a tricky one um [noise]\nYou know there's a hidden half of the plants that we don't usually think about which is the root systems and so we see you know the leaves and we know leave sense light and temperature and lots of things so there's a root system that reveals a lot about the U.S\nAnd supplies have the ability to sense concentrations of nutrients and gradients of water and that will be a really different\nView of the world from the world that we inhabit on the sensory systems that we use so that might be a really really interesting insight into the dynamics of going on underneath offbeat but we just ... usually just never really think about of course you'd have to stay put for the day [noise]\nIf you had roots yeah I didn't say it will be easy [laughter]\nYeah it would bring you into the world of the challenges but also the opportunities that you get by having that way of dealing with the environment around you so parts have access to resources that human stone\nOn food that just different approaches to solving the conundrum of how do I stay alive and reproduce on the U.S well\nSimon go right thank you so much for joining us today

I'm Talking about the ability of bacteria to count how many of their brethren are around them and then when there are enough do something altogether as a group\nOr I'm sensing is a hot area of research in microbiology and this guy knows something about it he coined the term\nYeah I'm Pete Greenberg I'm a micro biologist at the University of Washington and then what floats my boat is the way bacteria interact with each other\nEarlier in the show you heard how some mammals implants communicate well even a simpler organism like a bacterium has an impressive communication capability which it uses to coordinate activity\nSure they may be tiny but you do want to know what bacteria are up to because some of them will make you their home understanding quorum sensing can help us do encourage healthy bacterial growth or to prevent that which is harmful\nThey did that bacteria released molecules into their environment and also a sense what molecules are already there this tells them how many of their buddies are nearby and when they detect decorum they act their communication is sufficiently new ones didn't variable well it's tempting to call it language\nA lot of people will talk about the language of bacteria and that's a stretch to call what they do language they have the ability to communicate by using small chemicals they released some of their environment and their brother and can\nDetect those chemicals and if I'm not rather enter around all making the chemicals that on the signal everyone in the population to do some interesting behavior and analogy\nSmokers in a room so if one smoker comes into a\nLarge room a head of a meeting\nHere's a little bit of smoke in the room and nothing happens but as more and more people accumulate and everybody's smoking a level of the smoke in the room goes up and at some point there'll be a move to open the windows and that whole ... smoke out of the room and they'll be a\nA benefit to a group so where should I imagine that quorum sensing is taking place I mean maybe in my bloodstream but and maybe other places where where does this go on\nYeah so you know wherever bacteria congregate and groups which is pretty much anywhere\nThat's one ... cent in will occur\nWhen bacteria are free and the ocean they're low population density sound Kwan sensing doesn't occur in but if they are growing in a fish got or in a light Oregon of a fish or on a piece of algae they'll accumulate\nAnd ... cents and will occur we are interested in bacterial infections with shoot a mono sent along the ideas that one at first invades the host it's out low population density that doesn't display it's weapons and that can grow underneath the radar\nUntil it gets to a point where there are enough bacteria to make things up who hurt the host and then they do that in a coordinated fast\nSo when I think of a quorum sensing works it's because these individual bacteria are releasing if you will or some sort of signal molecule into the environment whatever that environment is blood water or whatever right and and then when it gets to a critical concentration they've reached decorum is is is that the deal\nYeah that's the idea so they make some inexpensive small molecule that as a proxy for their density\nEach bacterium is making it\nIf there's just one bacterium in a large environment as it's produced and put under the environment it will defuse away if there are a lot of bacteria packed together each bacterium making the small molecule\nThen the concentration and the environment goes up and when the concentration of these small molecules reaches a critical point\nIt can interact with her a sector that is present on every bacterial cell and one that does that the bacteria no there are enough of their brother and around and they commenced to do these social activities\nYou point out that the signals are small molecules are in other words if they're releasing some sort of chemicals into the into the water there or whatever the local environment as and so um what kind of chemicals are being released here can you give an example\nYeah I'll give an example so when we first started working on this we were working on a particular really interesting bacterium hits or marine bacterium that makes light", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
