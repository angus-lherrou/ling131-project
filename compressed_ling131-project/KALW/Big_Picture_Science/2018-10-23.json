the chocolate [noise]\nThe odor is rich and warm and\nOr just an enormous vat of bubbly melted cocoa and sugar I don't know but it is an atmospheric current of deliciousness running right under my nose and so in Congress to my surroundings I Wonder if it's an olfactory hallucination conjured by my tired brain\nInhaled deeply in the hope that somehow magically that will produce the chocolate itself [noise]\nI've never gotten to the origin of this be wishing smell and now I'm going to\nA little bit of research tells me that half a mile from the train station is the likely source so I'm going there now\nI'm approaching the factory and\nIt is starting to smell like chocolate [noise]\nWelcome to the guitar trucking company\nCan give it to stretch of microbiology\nAll right so this is a bona fide chocolate company and I'm guessing that you may be the source of that wonderful aroma that hits me occasionally at the train station\nYes we are in the process of roasting cocoa beans and the smell from those cocoa beans diffuses out into the air and it smells like hot cocoa when you're standing outside some more away from the point it\nNow why is it that I just smell it occasionally um and it seems to be only in the evenings but maybe that's just when I'm returning home but they don't smell it every day\nHas to do with the wind direction that has to do with the humidity has to do with all the atmospheric conditions but we're roasting pretty much every day so it's out there but you're just not smelling it\nInto the roasting smell is quite full an aromatic I thought it had to be brownies or cookies but it's not as the beans themselves\nTo the essence of chocolate which are the cocoa beans and part of the flavor development is created through the roasting process\nDo you get used to the smell I mean at some point does your nose adapt and you don't smell that wonderful chocolate anymore\nAs you approach the plant and smell it will always recognize it but when you're in the plant you could use to smell\nWill thank you very much you solve this mystery for me You're welcome\nAs I leave the factory the air is perfumes with the center of roasting cocoa beans [noise]\nAnd I learned that I'm not imagine at the realm of chocolate really does feel the air at the train station because half a mile away there is a chocolate factory or should we call it a chocolate olfactory\nGood slipping Molly I Hope you'll bring some of that chocolate to the studio when you come in\nNow dogs track down since routinely that's what they do they lead with their noses humans are born smugglers too but you know with the exception of the mouth watering the realm of sweets we often dismissed the odors that envelop of dogs do not smelling is how the map their world\n\nFor a dog the air is filled with information [noise] they have hundreds of millions more olfactory receptors you there's now than we do making them serious sniffer\nDogs can detect traces of explosives and even

followed him with a dog into a world of smell\nI Am following my nose along Amsterdam avenue toward Dr Horwitz his dog cognition lab\nBarnard College I'm picking up orders of hot\nFlowers\nIndian spice and I imagine entering the dog cognition lab and being greeted by dog smells in a row of sniffing animals first though I mean Alexander her with in our campus office [noise]\nAlexandria where in your office at\nBernard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but\nSo we should maybe revise because this is really the dog cognition lab the dog ... anywhere where\nWe are studying dogs essentially so we do actually\nDo some behavioral tests in this room there's tape on the floor so we are videotaping and monitoring what the dogs are doing but I also studied dogs out and their natural environment in the parks I go to ... homes I said he dogs they're so kind of any place with their dogs could be the cognition lab [noise]\nOkay so it turned out the dog cognition lab was right under my nose [noise] dogs have some of the makings of good scientists they're curious about everything they can't stop collecting data but since dogs don't submit their conclusions about what they smell to referee journals\nDr horribly studies they're sniffing behavior to make inferences about their cognition and what ... they are\nDogs have now been trained detection dogs have now been trained to tell us when they notice all manner of object and\nReally most objects have a smell potentially if you have the equipment to detect it so that is everything from you know explosives detection dogs they're cancer detection dogs their dogs who can detect um bed bugs of course than any other varieties many other varieties of insects\nThere are Scott detection dogs in other words dogs are being used by researchers to\nFind the Scott and the ... of wildlife populations that they're trying to canvas but that are hard to see their diabetes detection dogs can tell when blood sugar is dropping\nSo really you could put their nose in any direction just tell them what it is that you want them to notice and they'll notice it for you\nDogs can detect all manner of objects as you say and how much do they need to detect any just a tiny bit and and and how how low does that that concentration go\nRight they often need only a very little bit so I think it's something on the order of uh Pica Graham a trillion of ground of TNT or other explosive for an explosive detective detection dog to to notice it\nThat's at a far lower threshold that we can detect that we have decent noses but we don't bother to sniff things\nUm that detection threshold is really different depending on the odor and so some objects they really need that minimal amount others they might need more like a millionth of a gram much much more\nI'd like to pick up on something you said of dogs can detect cancer and I understand that they can detect certain kinds of melanoma and you also said diabetes so I Wonder if that suggests that we are emitting something from her skin is it her skin that they're smelling\nA lot of dogs who come in with their owners won't approach the samples\nAnd I think it's because the owners have been spent a lifetime telling that dog not to miss things\nActually when we pull our dog away from the smells we're telling them they're not allowed to you know use that perceptual Oregon and they and they're pretty cooperative it kind of stop using it as much\nAnd it's sad that mean they can learn to use it again right and when they come upon this you know must be like discovering your own superpower\nNow I was amazed to learn that dogs can smell well it's not it's not surprising that they could smell the movement of air through the room but because they can do that you write that they can actually smell the time of day so I'm Wondering if you could tell us the difference between how afternoon in mourning smells\nYeah or what would a dog that I Wish I knew exactly but I think I can almost imagine a little bit it's like the way of seasons have a different smell right we might notice the advent of spring and a lot\nMore is happening when the seasons change than in our living room throughout the day\nWell the temperature of the room changes all day right I think that's what it is it's that air flow through the day is pretty reliable um air rises along the walls as the room is warm and then it kind of hugs the ceiling and then start falling and it kind of crashes into itself\nAnd imagery of this is kind of wonderful like a backwards waterfalls of air going up the walls and then and then crashing down as a waterfall in the middle of the room\nSo I haven't seen an example of how dogs do use this to tell the time of day but we can see that dogs are attuned to odors and different parts of the room at different times of the day so they're presumably marking that day by this air flow this natural Airflow\nI'm so for instance one's own smell in the room will be moved to the side of the room and your accents as the day goes on\nWhen you were going through the self directed experiment on trying to improve your own smelly inability she could smell like your dog um did you ever sit in a room and and try to see if you could smell the different times of day\n[noise] haven't sat in the room the way dogs might send in the room all day and try to smell the difference I don't think I have the acuity for that but I have done other ... and I regularly do other exercises still that\nTry to bring smell and prominently so when I wake up in the morning I Try to smell how late it is you know five if I don't set an alarm so\nWhat six AM versus nine AM that's exactly what you're trying to smell you're trying to smell kind of the war of the day how much of the day is happened there is a smell in a room at a certain time of day and I think you might notice it if it was different\nIt's that type of thing and I also try to figure out if there's anyone in the bed with me and I are dogs sleep with us\nAnd so I have my husband and my cat and two dogs and my son who might be in the bed in the morning and without hearing or seeing anything I Try to\nJust notice by smell if anyone in the bed and sometimes I can do it not not reliably not all the time but that's the type of thing I Try to do to imagine a little bit what it might be like to be that dog\nI assume you've invested in a king size bed of Vegas that you can get yeah Alexandra Horowitz thank you so much for speaking with us my pleasure\nAlexandra Horowitz has a dog cognition researcher at Barnard College and author of being a dog following the dog into a world of smell\nWell before you have a pity party about what you're missing lamenting the fact that you'll never have the sniffer of a schnauzer the ...\nThe nostrils of a new fee we bring you could ... your own ... it was actually pretty good at least while you're awake coming up how your nose helps\nYou

A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nWhen it comes to our senses we can see as they were why were grateful for our acute vision for our exquisitely sensitive hearing\nThe sense of smell may be number one for a dog but for humans it's often rated as least important it's the dispensable sense and the one that people would be willing to lose if they had to lose one\nTo reconsider our sense of smell is not only better than we think it is more important than we think smell plays a big role in love and even survival and we needed to fully enjoy the taste of food if you're skeptical about that here's an experiment\nA couple of jelly beans different colors they you know are they going to have different flavors\nPut one in your mouth and plug your nose at the same time now bite down on the jelly bean and with your nose ... taste sweetness\nThen release your nostrils and you'll be shocked by the experience of suddenly having the flavor of licorice are lime or bubble gum or whatever the jelly bean as and that's a fantastic way of really illustrate\nOf with what we consume but\nWhat about the role that our sense of smell plays in those other things like love and survival will conduct of neuro scientist Rachel Herz so is it our sense of smell was the first since to evolve\nIt's located in a part of the brain associated with memory and emotion so if you haven't already had the honor maybe it's time to meet your nose it's more than a resting place for your\nGlasses we sometimes read a reference to the extraordinary ability of super smugglers who conduct voter tests and pick out the electable foods should we envied them\nSuper smell or is as far as I Know don't exist there are people who are quote unquote noses and that some people who are in the perfume industry primarily who are very good smell ers and mainly because they had been trained and also because they're paying exceptional attention\nTo what they are smelling and the more attention we pay the more we can actually smell because the more of our brain is being used but the other thing is that we all in fact have a unique nose when it comes to the receptors that are expressed\nWhich means that for some people specific odor as compounds are going to smell somewhat stronger because of the fact they may have more of a specific kind of receptor that's sensitive to those compounds\nAnd for others that's going to smell weaker there's different ones for each person so there may be people who are super smugglers of a specific kind of chemical if that is even true but it isn't the case that there are super smell or is the way they are super tasters I'm super tasters or something different\nBook on a super taster tastes was do you know I as a non super taster can't\nWell you may actually be a super taster so super tasters taste everything more that is to say they get more sweetness and more salty nothing more bitterness especially\nAnd sour and as from a taste that they perceive they also get more creamy ness when they're eating something fatty or you know less like ice cream and more spicy and that's when they're eating hot pepper\nNow what a super taster has actually more taste buds on their time than people who are tasters or non tasters there's three classification so you're either a super taster it tastes are non taster as super tasters have the most taste buds tasters are like in between there sort of the Goldilocks version and the non tasters have the U.S\nLet's get back to our sense of smell then our our nose is actually pretty good at smelling apparently we shouldn't so our noses or it's essential we know it's essential that taste food and to enjoy the rose but you also had written that it's essential for relationships\nWhat we found and other people have as well is that it's especially essential for women in terms of relationships so in terms of the century feature that women find them most attractive and which is most important for them in terms of\nSelecting a lover it actually how a man smells because she can only have a certain number of children in her life span and it's actually not that many so she wants to make sure that the children that she does have are going to survive and thrive\nAnd the most important thing for that is health\nAnd it turns out that body odor is the external representation of the genes of your immune system\nAnd so the smell of somebody is actually in an indication of their immune system and the smells from men that women find most attractive are indicative of the fact that their immune systems are actually complementary and that they're likely to having a child who is most healthy is there", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23"}
