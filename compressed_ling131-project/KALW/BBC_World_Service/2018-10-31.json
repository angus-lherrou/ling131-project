[noise]\nNow until the\nFriday the fucking September [noise]\nI'm Laura under investigative reporter with the Courier Journal I'm working on a story about babies who are born with John from drugs [noise]\nI take care of the babies that are in the ICU um after they're born to them you know I see you [noise]\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies there incidents that\nWere exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure if long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that substance once airborne and they no longer have that substance being provided\nThey become at risk of going through withdrawal and what parts of um withdrawal symptoms debate has so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney a which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing set of babies are in control of all and crying that is babies don't handle that you and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for\nHours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime they sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick\nBut babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has gone down up stay the same certainly\nIn the same I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had at seven hundred percent increase in substance affected and sent in the past decade\nIn Kentucky or nationally nationally and at the trends in Kentucky or probably leading that pack\nUm she's one we go today [noise]\nShe had some problem she breed than some of the foot when she was coming out and she had flood on her lungs so she had to come up here to the NICU before she showed in the withdrawal symptoms

about though is well doesn't it I mean the America's always being about people coming to see the American dream is dean always be in the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds\nThat was a time of the birth rate in the Arab states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of\nPopulation change in the United states and that era if you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication there are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skill workers who could\nFuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new bodies if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy then the situation is quite different and it creates new\nClass stratification that entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... Saddam editor of ...\nOf being immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American narrative south of the panelists immigrant\nWho arrives to seek a new life on through hard work determination goes on to cross the and thrive so would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described\nAs homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to the Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of\nPeople defined as racially ineligible to citizenship and they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the myth of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European immigration where this oppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants\nIt was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who were coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are feeling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there is not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean a period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there haven't even more recent\nThat can or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those calculations have been permanently marginal\nClear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to ... the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his argument\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change it caught in the ... needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is changing it to one that founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge
