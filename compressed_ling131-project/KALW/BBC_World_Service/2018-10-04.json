bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't ...\nOh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nIf never felt like they had to go out in the field to wear enough because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from bad choices they might make for the best reasons\nRight I feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated does that make sense [noise]\nIt does make sense [noise]\nWhen she was little she felt she have to work she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nAnd so she says most should be done to lift that responsibility of the shoulders of children like come\nOn to the parents to find another way to ban helps do that that ...\nThat the some of the poorest families in the world that is no other way\n\nHot for book we can and cannot do\n\nMeet India\nWe have been able to actually create religious which have been trying to leave a free by addressing hold of the issues in the ... to ... degree communities really spoke to do me a bit of children seem to be ... a week that's can be to rot in them\nYeah and she's now director of advocacy and fundraising it's concerned for wasn't children as a child to the ... a charity that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of pressure on countries like mine to insist that is No Child labor anymore in most sectors certainly in exports victors the idea is to say that these broad except clean they're not touched by hands of child labor\nBecause if they're seen as connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they won't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge that presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they will to dissipate in\nAnd here in Studio on the phone working the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them over ... ... homes where they're locked up that you're not away from their families and the state cause the family and then the child should never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove them to work in the first place I haven't been solved\nAnd this is where I could be threatened his organization comes and\nThey meet child labor is an advantages and often than not that parents why they walk\nSome talks about the whole meal they get to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they had to call for the younger siblings will fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey are not willing to transfer the burden on to the family for instance if they were fishing walked up they will not okay with seeing that your mother fish water and you'll be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do ...\nThey had to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on that parents and so it could be threatened us charity tend to what's known as the hunt chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot of the ... my organization has been to walk with these local governments with children sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be a scholarship for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for child care so children don't have to the cost of the younger siblings\nIn other cases of each year for another child and they're not the case it can be getting electricity for house once we don't have it and that is how we were able to create ... communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free she doesn't mean these are communities when no children look what she means is that the works that doing no longer interferes with school\nLike type ... and she says some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform so what about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come up with a document called look we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids that you feel ... coast which are very to implement booth and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's harmful look it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some might be exhausted by hours of household chores and prefer to spend two hours working for a local shop others might choose factory work over milking temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited but as a child\nAll the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases are responsibilities been working with children died at least you don't let them take that one decision and then forget then you're still in touch with them\nYou're part of their life [noise] then I was working with children council throughout Bangalore it's time consuming and expensive but it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] the\nI Know the organization behind the global ban has no children enjoy such an age should never what we heard about the unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous was called ... by the authorities it's debatable continue\nBut when you take a step back to pay the deal like human isn't just about policy ...\n... it's about something real fundamental some particularly in the\nWest and child under assassinate you what is by definition being exploited others say a child\nShould have the right to work\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right down to the line on definition of child labor it's about how we view childhood\n\n\nThis inquiry was
