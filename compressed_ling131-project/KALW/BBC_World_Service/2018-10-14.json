Canada\nAnd returned to Lebanon for six formative years of my life [laughter] watching Lebanon rebuilt after the war was significant for me as a human as a woman as an artist and it has inspired me to

out of the key of my own home having traveled everywhere and feeling a little bit like a nomad myself and I was inspired by the Palestinian tradition of wearing your key around your neck\nThat came to Lebanon in the millions and they left their homes behind and I wanted to use that symbol to empower refugees and to change the narrative because when we see images of refugees in the media it's never
