their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate pacts got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect than a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawns fats artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out the vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own\nAnd if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington\nRight what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently than anyone else's thoughts\nLegacy will be how different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is the million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google\nOn recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nBetter overall glucose his car he losing quoting to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment ... do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all universally found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better war can turn out to voters that are not being picked up in the polls Ken you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good play to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial\nTo the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way of them and\nGet out and vote and\nEnsuring our forty present a tree trunk [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over all may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research I'm a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential on voters so how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies and through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy\nAdvertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television but I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor\nCampaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race\nAnd you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna you're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely ... with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio\nOr in the next in the next ten days\nProfessor government Mike friends separates to oh this also do political advertising we've been discussing we'd do wait to see ... of how much manipulation on line ... by trolls for example ... foreign actors\nMay have influenced this election that could be the subject for another business dating we shall see

I was like okay so do you drink too shy shy so I can see a little bit different strikes will ...\nWill I be talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers all of the brain training at ... who's findings who appeared in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage that has some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nUm wants treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nThey as psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you\nGo and wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way out in these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there were right there is nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... taken him a disease of drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss our eyes drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients uh don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training at is more affected was the thinking behind well the thinking behind it\nWas the festival\nAlso when you have to do the C B te therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital\nI have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment and that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on the behavior\nYes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy they would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or use a cloth\nI realize that actually the something nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or when I catch up and I don't need to rush away and wash my hands\nSo what sort of says has have you had with those using this some brain training and\nSo we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the ... for one wakes up they used it for long ago it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a cognitive ability so they're not so ... and that cognitive thinking anymore they're not so much for all they can sort of thinking more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals and their obsessive thoughts\nThat is a professor Barbara

exercises and joint drills so\nHave seen that there's a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises and measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um I'm not giving up the territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNo they haven't so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to who\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other built some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to worked with each other honest\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states has the common enemy\n[noise] um I think China um is certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea\nAs one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce its bilateral multilateral relationships in that region um but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon it don't bilateral multilateral relationships there\n[noise] we do we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on who wins walked in the south

features\nSo um it's still up for grabs is Bush was saying and whoever\nHangs on to want to have a a gets to keep\nWell um it's definitely going to be difficult to say that countries who occupy certain features at the moment will suddenly relinquish them um by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at that sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on a in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the United states do you do see the the potential for ... conflict has occurred in the south China Sea\nSome before between the United states and China on um I mean the the near collision that we saw recently\nUh between a Chinese and American ship 'em was certainly worrying I'm On the United states that\nHave been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war are looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing\nUm and that is exactly what these types of of exercises in simulations are for um which is why we see

the elevator door open and I just remember thinking my mind as like I Am not going to die over a year left my right situation\nThat they could you know which way the ... that\nIt Gabriel I think had um had a good idea which way it open and then we we agreed because it was the only way that it made sense because that's how panic and how ... we had is that that we we didn't know which way the elevator door open normally when we got up to this elevator that we use every day\nNo one remembers that yeah I mean I'm sure everyone that's listening is going to think about that now [laughter]\nYeah remember jumping into back into the water and at this point the water was that about just at the bottom of my neck I yelled out to the police officers that I'm standing facing the elevator doors and the door opens to my left I'm facing the elevator door and it opens to my left\nAnd that's that's what I remember saying\nAnd so Ryan how to crawl Barnes is right away just went to the left side and uh poodles forced into it and uh he was able to pop it\n[noise] the doors and\nDoors open a that was the first one that I knew that it that we're going to see her family's again [noise] ... very difficult to explain the feeling like relief or ...\nI'd say a combination of of both it's not any one one feeling but then it was also a feeling of finally as letting my survival instinct in that adrenalin some side I did like art and training as a child and I forgot how to swim for about three seconds\nAs I'm getting out of the elevator yeah he's like a ...\nYou ended up swimming to the door\nUs we can agree with the basement\nIt's almost like I just let the police officer drag me out because I was the first moment that I can let myself I'm ...\nLike a whole body just sort of let go yeah [noise]\nIf they had arrived five or ten minutes later [noise] would you still be alive [noise]\nWe played around with the idea of that I used to think about in a you know in parallel universes what's what's going on with different versions of yourself from physics or quantum mechanics but I'm pretty sure that in some versions are myself other universes I'm I didn't make it out of there\nI think I was more rattled than I than I realized I'm immediately afterwards at one point I had the realization that almost died ... how do you deal with that I think I cried for about two or three seconds and then put myself together\nThe officers left they didn't get to say much to Gabriel all ... and then they went on and just lay awake in bed\nOr something maybe two hours a night I'm your replaying things in your head and [noise] there's overwhelming I really\nStarted soaking in on the way back to the station the gravity of the situation and you start realizing that did we just have to people's lives and uh um so yeah so then you get kind of a second rush of adrenaline\nI guess it's probably hard to to think of yourself in the way that people describe you which is of course and using the LEDs hero but I mean did you have a moment of patting yourself on the back that night\nI was telling Josh today even 'cause we work together and like I still have a hard time thinking\nOf using the word\nWell you might not be able to describe yourself that way but what would you hold on one second I just got I got to do something really quickly\n... told me that part of the condition of agreeing to this interview was that he wanted to thank the offices for what they've done and that I could connect them so I called him [noise]\nThank you\nIt's nice to to finally

in such a bold way and for that Byron potential to include sign many nations I think when he is a wonderful thing I was just\nIt just ... when I read the news today\nAt least ... members of the European Parliament seemed to be a head of the global game on this\nOh absolutely and I think they can afford to be out of the global game because the European public is ready for it which is really what I think as I pass a part of this story what are your reservations ban is a pretty extreme so the question is then what will people using\nAnd new businesses that are offering us environmentally friendly alternative and better recycling chains and so on we know that the vast majority of plastics that enter the ocean\nAren't coming from Europe that coming from other parts of the world particularly areas of Asia and\nMost problematic are are those countries that don't have good strong formal or well managed waste management system and it doesn't sound like a very exciting thing to do what a waste management says ...\nBut it's actually vitally important how good flows of collection drew chew recycling and other ways of managing way streams\nDon't you're totally there's been talk about the European public at least being ready for these changes even of the blue planets effects are really into the the BBC uh today would ask them for a documentary that's highlights of the problems of plastic couldn't see\nHow people really ready not to have those things that hold balloons up not to have strolls drinks drove through his coffin bugs that part of everyday life\nThat they are but I think there was that pieces of everyday life that we don't really needs I noticed that in shows and I think everybody kind of realize is that now they believe ... was enormous among people realize that they saw the plastics even more\nIn in the works on the beach and in the river systems they live nearby and things like that\nDoesn't opportunity isn't the Lisa for new industries to emerge to make medals rules to make more close bags and so on there's got to be plugged\nFor example on using seaweed or that kind of political plastic so creating something that has some of the same property has plastic can perform\nDifferently when released into the environment not damaging and there's lots of innovation around approaches collection soldiers innovation over policy that's an opportunity as well as creating attractive recycled materials that people can use as well there's there's loads of opportunity\nCould I ask at least our question today it's at ... ... is it a ... up on on just production of these products\nThat doesn't appear to be a ban on plastics in certain products which would be a you know I\nWill I Believe in and we don't need to import says well our information on her own so far is that it includes an import ban but actually I was going to ask you Michelle it's a long ways from any peace deciding on this to making sure there are there are no Chinese plastic stools in a goldfish open space it ...\nIt really is and the devil is going to be the details isn't it I can see these being phased over time is going to take time for alternatives to come to filter through the system but it's such a pleasant chase me and then I think it's so necessary\nTo you both have done on the ground research into the damage that plastic is doing in the seas but tell us if it was an image that particularly sticks in your mind what's happening\nI'm a deep sea and marine biologist and then we were in the south west Indian ocean about a thousand miles away from learned which would be than there is a source of Husted pollution and a thousand five hundred me is down and I remember we were doing a push go where we just try and get a small cylinder sediment out of the\nUh the Sunday plane are lacking on and we push to and when we got it back on the ship\nThough is that there was a series of plastic green polls they are ... that gives you the whole together cons right inside the middle of the sentiment pace and I just don't call we'll ... far away from land and we started keeping the oceans and I still I take a tiny little bit of this ocean floor and I find plastics and that was the one of the most\nStalk ... reading this plastic is only present it everywhere it's in every single sentiment called that we've ever looked at in the deep sea so it's it's quite tragic\nMarine biologist Dr Michelle Taylor and scientists Alisa ... now you might or might not be aware of the news hour we're committed to devoting both at time on results\nWe ... we go to the Kendal mountains of Scotland and here from Lincoln\nCells who runs a crow still small holding\nIn regards to climate change I think we've we've really noticed a big difference even just in in the last year so\nLast summer we went to really really wet periods from about may\nRight at three until October it seems like we never had a day without rain and then that kind of transformed into a a really long winter where we had we had about five months so we were under snow and no longer was snow melt thing that we went into a drive this summer and we had about five months where we had\nLiterally no rain whatsoever and such an amazing just in the last year to live through those kind of three weather extremes and\nEven though he's only been on the cross two and a half years we try to get to know our local farmers and speak to them about crime asked how they've noticed is changing and it'll tell you that in the last forty fifty years they've noticed how\nWinters in general are getting mild are on the summers are getting much much wetter so what we're starting to look through with\nWhat they're starting to really know that it's been happening\nWhen it really dry so for example the summer when it when it was really really dry the biggest challenge that we had\nWas availability of water so we were using water from our wealth to bring to the animals [noise] by the end of may beginning of June we realize that the well was about to run dry that was right at the very start at the summer and I am that was a mosque challenge for us we luckily how to spring\nOn site that ... running ...\n... ... every day by hand and in the meantime we were having to ... so that in the future if it happens again we've kinda got a backup and and the other thing that happened to ... not so much in our farm but certainly on a lot of other farms why they would have a large number of livestock as graft stopped growing\nSo normally you know\nKind of throw all your animals out in the summer and they'll spent days munching on the grass in the fields will they share people were actually starting to seat the livestock hey inside ledge and June and July because the ... or the ...\nTo to real kind of extreme weather like that and then\nYou know the contrast is in the winter when we were under snow for for five months and just make everything so much harder you know just getting around just harder it just makes everything that little bit harder here's what we need to be with us pharmacist we need to look at the last fifty years and we need to look at what\nThe Next Fifty years on hold and and change our businesses as a result of that and because otherwise farm businesses will start to suffer they'll start to fail\nAnd that's a big repercussions for not as far as the
