than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate but this is a transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country I grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies or to help us along that way\nAnd know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a it it it takes more\nNow than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping in equipping training or security or I just got to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people\nOr a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand all of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict and America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formally that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAnd why his own life ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where\nWhere do you allow us because we have to do that I don't think it'll stay straight on said who are very important\nQuestion 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts\nTo engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote\nFills that I have these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have coffee talk he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one consideration for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report adjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ...\nYou didn't know his name very exhausted from his trip you didn't have to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the\nTaliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan\nGovernment always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seem to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are\nAnd that's that's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor a success it's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right towards stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections\nThere more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Africa and society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see whether the whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not they they can only\nBe a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank

Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day lot fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction we knew it was time to show documents that the idea not that you might go back to there being any sort of state presence or a military presence or anything like that along\nThe border of deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is a pool to we established between the Irish republican ... and it's a real threat I think\nThat it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think about three lipstick I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think ... the hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests on maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of gifted and Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are ... and all that work would become a target\nThan if the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new day hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view you\nAll that people in ... and not into it would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that\nThe northern I wouldn't be excluded from that whereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders over the last few days and\nThey said to me you know we're called her head and her hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement and it's not being accepted as\nHow much of a discussion topic is for people on the day to day basis and what you are and ... this is something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking about a day in day oh it's\n... that has done is put the issue of the constitutional position high up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't seen in the past the pay state had sort of felt the constitutional position where I was ... with Brexit people here are talking about Irish unity and away The Waltons on the edge and\nThe ... with strength and northern Ireland's union with Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually have to fight as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the ideas so it's a very interesting set of circumstances certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every pulling all of these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWere in the middle of this storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between he and the u._k. but also in the context of the pie propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where\nThere if you have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focused on talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations\nThe Irish border all the history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's been old to a parent in the British Parliament this week\nWet pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party have been threatening to try and ... that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of foot with to raise a may ... anonymous sources have called the killings on\nShe survived so far but the border issue remains so how might it be resolved if indeed it ever is I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent Rob Watson\nNo it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it on ... ... how she felt this way\nTo you're absolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think there's a long level she has some good some bad days and some of her incredibly ... relationship with her I can only describe it as a fee broiled divided conservative policy\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look rather grim and challenging for her and that is\nHow long enough to she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies yes that fee brawl divided conservative policy which doesn't want any businesses in the ... which doesn't put a ... and on and and and and that was enough which satisfies the you twenty seven\nSeveral you've laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be filled that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of best a fairly clear up because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see how can it\nBe you're absolutely right I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that that we are in that if you like there's a contradiction in the Brexit projects and ... you is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics Justin and if you\nIf you think about what the what was what was leave all about so it was taking back like quote control of a bulldoze all ... ... ... a well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction us trade with the European Union and not have a bold and all the non\nUnless of course the European Union was to say guess what you can actually have a ... do you kind of something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs soon as hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about him being by Muslim you none of the things that we didn't like and he was saying was she gotta be kidding\nWhen they go ... ... how much should they should bring when shit how much of that is both sides kind of holding out for the best they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within the positions of the tree policy I\nThink some of it as brinkmanship ... doesn't think the AAU feels like compromising very much because it seems willing on a minute you know the people who voted to leave it's you'll mess\nYou clear it up and he clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions\nAnd our policy so I guess what's going to happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about just the ... will the future relationship\nBe what will happen with trade what will happen precisely how about the border so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union but all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship gonna what\nThat that'll get sort of kicked since that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBut listen if they can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement\nThen how life is it that that will come to a final sacrament they'll come to the the we get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that there'll be able to actually find some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question ... and of course it's it's one in a way\nWhen when he was good at is what drives ... people really infused ... about ... crazy they thing hang on a minute this these talks transition could go on forever and ever but it also both those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union saint who say this this just looks like a recipe for kind of\nChaos and disaster Britain soles of in the European Union but ... said it so now the prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just got back to the issue that these programs about the Irish border that is struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a sacrament in the in the longest I bought my assessment of the ... to look like who's likely to compromise\nLook it's an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at it for two years and of course\nYou know the ... the reason there's nowhere in the world whether it's not a bold and one of the two countries on and the customs union so in a way that you in the u._k. are trying to do the impossible I suspect\nThe compromise in the short term and it will only be able to show some will be that the whole of the you have to stay in the customs union until a future relationship is walks out with me\nNeither native would be such a close trading relationship that would be no need for a bold Raul absolutely no sign\nThat was Rob Watson the BBC's Westminster correspondent and Rob we'll be back to help guide us through the twists and turns of
