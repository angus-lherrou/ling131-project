[noise]\nBeyond refuse collection there is another area that's become a hot topic in space comb us that's mining Chris Louis is the founder and CEO of the U.S base thumb Planetree Brazil is one of the world's first and leading perspective space mine that's\nIn the last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general we now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons and other solar systems [noise]\nWe've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money being invested in\nSpace exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved away as it as it almost always does and with those points of inside the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society and to to new places\nWhat are you going to mine from a space money standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things in transportation\nVery expensive heavy things or you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge do a who's who may one right water or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first talk it used to be about\nYou know water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I water can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable says like\nHoliday that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the idea here 'cause there'll be a potential to the station and space for a gas station and space for these bussing spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term ... because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from us fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the costs of fuel as a proportion of a an eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shoot him spaces\nIs actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's a few really the deliverable that everyone is waiting for\n... absolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in his permanently and space and it'll it'll be that shuttle and that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that show gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need a ... colony first I mean or at least an an active sort of industry on a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the theories of stepping stones that that's the thing is this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects a multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers\nAnd of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuick question that if you you go you got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on into prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do and the luge besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several\nDecades now that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt happening now how soon are you going to have a pro are starting to prospect on that particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of ...\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million

openly about what they've been through and to take away the shame\nNot easy and places like India where a woman is raped at every Thirteen minutes according to the country's crime statistics\nBut we're convictions are few and far between\nAttitudes have started to change in recent years with many high profile rape cases splitting the issue prominently on the political agenda\nBut back when I was a teenager denial and shame were prevalent reactions to rape so how does dedication to this issue started in the summer of Nineteen eighty she was Seventeen and had recently moved to the United states with her family that summer she'd gone back to my mind with her father for a visit\nNow I have to warn you some of you may find what you're about to hear distressing\nI had gone for a walk on
