can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies and his path towards peace and I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nThe overwhelming factor has been his relationship with North Korea and has a developing a piece of member he came to power last year\nAnd just as the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong anywhere at their worst I mean this time last year at North Korea had carried six successful nuclear test on trumpet threatened\nTo resign fire and fury in Pyongyang and many feared the Korean Peninsula was once again on the brink of war so he has been seen as somebody who has been pushing for peace in his poll numbers do go off\nAfter any summit with Kim Jong un\nDomestically he does have a bit of a problem because people here are worried about unemployment rates I mean amongst young people for instance itself at ten percent\nUsed it from the b._b._c. on them because we can come to shop for this particular better now where questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you set up to provide education for girls\nEnded up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as Ted\nYeah then more than me educational ... he was founded by an American women kitchen miner who raised millions of dollars and was even gone to a building or by the then president and Johnson said lease by trying to fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate unreasonable funds despite do scandal on good people in Liberia now one month to up the story in a year long investigation on Tuesday was really\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often and managing scholarship program but sadly in the background\nOver the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements the police\nHad been raped by the co founder\nHow old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as youngest ten when the rapes began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts and talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care or so when the rates came to light\nThe organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mount an organization who doesn't intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then they simply said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations owned and\nOperated in cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl\nDemand ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nChallenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has a victim so what we know is that to students who are named lessons victim spots indicted tested positive\nSo very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you know if there'll be any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place that's certainly true that the organization\nSo to to strengthen its policies and so to improve its hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson hundred\nOne of the girls and actually there it's been reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely the organization type the policies\nBut almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person

political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see a criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some a teen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more ... than virtually any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... walls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia\nIs really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should\nIf there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for Obama than solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening a Saudi influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed by the use of American weapons\nBy the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas there's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis and I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula\nMy Dolly the sheep we have talks

interesting question about just how secure MBA his grip on power is what do you think\nWell secure a crown prince who had already guaranteed that he's gonna be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way my mother said man had behaved especially at towards his own cousins\nIn addition to run into a lot there was an important ... I've been I've done the whole in the head of the national guard and Saudi Arabia he had a military base and warm security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the oil installations\nBut it's been ten men as secure in his position he wouldn't really result to these kinds of erratic\nActs the war in Yemen it's been going on for over for like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using west and a ministry equipment and also expect tease that's not forget that are\nPeople from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and\nHave heard that without us and you can support this war in Yemen would not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between\nSaudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians a framework which frankly gains a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported the growth in Lebanon in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it\nAt a press in regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and put him under house arrest forced him to resign just this that bin Laden yet another country in the middle east\nAnd precipitation probably and all their immigration and added a few genes crisis to go that far without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting as certain\nConditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support is unbelievable\nHave to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic\nThey we see a young ruler let's call them the ruler of the country NBS there's just thirty three years old he controls pretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a virus the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other to the those strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt\nInstability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at almost the Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform\nOr by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other Saturdays\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turn\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world that have close relations with the kingdom\nYou've been hoping\nFor some sort of change in Saudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed moment\nNot under the leadership of ...

cleanly the single most important one is\nThe sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people were left behind those responsible was punished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has\nThere is a loss of trust in Egypt and on preparedness to believe actual

the time didn't you when the ... brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the tea\nYes I have this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis I was two blocks away from the human side of it it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in ways if you break your comics I just sold in the bottom to London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in ... deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as

technically it wasn't they weren't actually taking them on the outs with them but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we hits tryouts publicizing this would have been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this than we are going to get into trouble because this is gonna look irresponsible it's going to look for say we're in fighting panic\nThe things

does that mean that politics can lead is way down to make big sacrifices\nWell there are some pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the anatomy sap idle\nHands a tunnel is Laura ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham Institute of climate change at the London School of economics\nCilia Steinbeck I he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin ... one more passing and nuts you re ... he's one of the office of this week's PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price is the world's on track to teach anything like that target festival\nOn to clarify the report doesn't call for anything the report on so it's a question that the governments have off the eyepiece you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen into Perry's agreement um it was clear duck two degrees of global warming was not a safe level and governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warm into one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is milk on track currently the pledges of the countries that have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereabouts in mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSo paint a picture of ... the consequences of temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming redoing see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a redo your shift into impacts\nOn forests and other systems and find the also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by he drapes\nSo already some stock consequences coming out that a roadmap power enough do you try and make the changes that are needed to bring the temperatures down well sort of things does the report suggest might be necessary\nShow that to people especially at the fall we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and my wife has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\n'cause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flight\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of well that is both lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the sense that the bed and will there be some jokes that since the end\nThink here it's useful to differentiate between short\nWell to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten a some people were saying that these ... out and they said we know that there are some costs however\nShort term costs nothing equate long term\nQuake on policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... that you cannot another country and in other countries have hurt the most a low income people said larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no do says what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get\nThese short term ... cases if I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um well I\nLike to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the transition we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective\n... greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point five powers target for example I can see that now in the parliament no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world is climate change with climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable in how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nKnow it just went to work to do that when I came to question who's going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does\nThis reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question we're going to pay for it for just one solution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already Rick won't four and five degrees of warming\nAnd ... to a degree or form induces ... into\nFar future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees you have to a gym about twenty five years later so does this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay

managed so\nCompatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare law where he wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other ... thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly\nCities is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance let's agree you know but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize that there's being um scholars and partly because high is working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so\nIt's these invest managing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough as they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point and he's made also in their report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable are not hurt is not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get to support you need both\nHer when we talk about coffee is important but we remember the\nGlobal economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether\nWe make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by

two years they all trends in the global economy vote are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we design cities more effectively ... thoughts the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRole of of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now thank you to a panel ...

change will talk to a former fed official about what the president's attacks me for the institution that afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nLet's hear from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's tradition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the can you imagine anything that the ... say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nFault no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are uh\nMuch more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda [noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disown that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that tree howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other ... chives shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the point the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular and there's one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they happen you know the size of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending you know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with it Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that's\nThe first well the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the group though he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joined I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example than the economy is growing\nFast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to uh some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables but at the scene that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not linked fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you\nAnd doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments ... that a country that's growing is simply not positive\nIt wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space to action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world\nHave to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old\nTried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels but\nThe question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\n[noise] the problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other\nI think that there is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I really think that if you can get social movement going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow soft him as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at the agriculture\nReally suffer and there's a strong reason to take that into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\n... so the big reasons to India to make changes similarly big reasons to China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time spent months but I think any kind of well run the country any kind of country that has a government that cares about its population\nIn fact be pushed by that population effect population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same place we are now will be much much worse off in terms of the impacts we've committed into the system if that if that awareness is spread and
