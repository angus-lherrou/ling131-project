happen again so that's how we got stopped it but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business fulltime was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA lot of people go for all the show treatments of ... treatments edit them at ... or they will

first start it very much like comedy and we only had a few thousand dollars to a name we did not come from a family where money was not a problem but that said a small company and a growing company\nI think we saw so there's always something we have to juggle we have to be smart we can never played a game like how the ... thing gamble Johnson and Johnson Pence then when we are marketing I think the

eight to ten clients today you don't need to acquire a social media following up hundreds of thousands have a successful business\nIf he calculates the amount of book couple hours you have a new month they might be two hundred so you need to do is find two hundred clients esteem not twenty percent of them are going to be regulars and loyalty and cultivate relationships with those\nPeople because when it comes to a beauty the lifetime body of customers running to the thousands I've been with my hairdresser for nine years I've been with my ... you know so it's not always about big numbers in influence marketing it's about\nSmall numbers but having higher quality relationships with your customers\nMaking that connection physically I'm with you and your parents were making over the beauty industry the Singaporeans spot or not pointing out and trauma dean read who founded one now and the beauty networking site beauty stack\nWhen you look at the ship and the boy dreams of the major beauty companies they still seem to be one maybe by men who need the other end of immigration you have women working within the industry who tend to be\nPaid quaint body they knew he paid work is Whitey thing that is that women working these industries of pizza ...\nI Do believe that some of the Asian type in like the conglomerates that come from Japan or Korea they are largely male dominated but in fact I'm looking at the small medium enterprises in Singapore that have grown over the last twenty Thirty years we have very good reputation\nMy mom's age which is like fifty five fifty eight years old so they have been in this line for the last Thirty years\nSo I guess being into beauty industry in Singapore we are a little bit fortunate in that way where I Believe that that is a good mix of possibilities for women to to be an entrepreneur and to shine and do well as well [noise]\nThe second part on whether or not women um lowly paid and why is that the situation being an industry we do know what is the industry rates especially for the phone line technicians who are the ... all the front line retail stuff\nBecause in Singapore there is no minimum wage\nBut I strongly believe it is the choice of entrepreneur did business owner on how they wanted to structure del wages\nIf you want your employees to be that cram to cram the best employees out there then you have to pay a little bit or not just a little bit or you have to pay above\nThe average not just minimum wage above average and structure compensation system such that they know that they would be competitive for good luck not just in sales and service in technical expertise and we offer a career progression so they know that\nFor example I've got a girl with us and so that mean assistant who now is running my entire climbed relations operations team in the last five years she's been five years and that kind of progression would have been very very rare ... take on how much longer\nTo the jury professions as one of one where you do it and I'm just wondering ... in terms of the new business things like maternity leave and paternity leave which tend to be ... for women in your progressing with them to Korea is how do you personally to deal with that\nWould disagree with pulling statement that it's the choice of the entrepreneur or to remove the barrio the lowly wages NBC\nBecause when I said ... you know I didn't enjoy running this business in those early days is because I felt deeply uncomfortable with paying another go like eight pounds in Iowa it made me feel weird to do that because\nIt just didn't sit right with me about this is where I disagree with the fact that it's the choice of the entrepreneur\nBeauty is not seen as a essential hole a therapeutic old health giving surveys right\nSo because the market right for beauty is in finish treatment is low you can't pay higher wages because the economics of your business will not walk so using your nails done I'm Talking full ... as a critic Niles\nFull I've seen a critic now says low sixteen pounds right now for sixteen pounds it takes about an hour so you're taking away the wage the other's heads the costs of goods the cost of products et cetera\nYou ... then pay a higher wage so when you were doing you'll ...\nYou'll like how much can I pushed the treatment to pay my team\nA fair wage and then a wall we charge fifty pounds were critics very expensive we have the following in central London we use the best quality products are alone is hygiene Nick on looks nice and isn't generally nice environment to be in\nBut because of all of this we don't make masses of profit because I'm choosing to pay\nOn now technicians badly there any reason I can make better choices because I've another business and other business prospects in other ways to make money but for the average\nHas a loner and a beauty salon on now sell on ... you can't always pay the wage that you would want to pay because the economics

clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to treat other people we went up when you see in our clinic\nSome people get cholera some people get typhoid sweet adequately reaching some guys what do we do\nSomeone at the committee had a suggestion idea given that you know what\nWhat is the opposite of fear edge and by the guy on\nI don't know\nWhere the topic will be clean no see which\nWhen it's lumping you see the ... ...\nI'm like wow this is a good idea\nThis idea we just want somebody who knew somebody that we need to we just sat there and you're like wow indirect let me go pick up I Will look at the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way ... experience in states us in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWhere we the people who made it to that's why we have I been none of them are criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes admitting that they started cutting the pipes I tried it started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will be on I took my wife or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was watching them income that's why we're able to survive than there is a deal yeah also\nWhat time we don't ... mostly on the weekends we don't do send water but that's what they said the water there this is Kenny\nOld I've ah he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWe sent for two shootings and they said for Penn\nSo you will say it's clean my windows clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your experience offense yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to work with them with a friend that we without to it on the impact of the system so that's your what's your next [laughter]\n\n\n\nJust listening to Kenny how his life story the sun makes me realize that he really is the key\nTo this solution here and we sell all within our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows he's world he's street smart he's slums more\nIf you like he knows how to operate the yeah I didn't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kenny just off on his own and doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for those that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit last still a lot of money the ... yeah I put all of that the shelf that\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size ah everything's\nBeing signed off by the ...\nAre paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf though just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation a hotel room yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with all of the ... but there are other projects to ... the only one son who were trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people I Know when I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums and\nJust in Kibera a you know the ... to ... they all said and I'm thinking one woman she said and Wonder Woman with ... she was a ... a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that also dreading bull holes that pumping wool syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just boxing it up and passing it out so they got the walk through the same way about different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes maybe the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... different players involved as you said it's a ... fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this bull whole system might\nActually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said ultimately the real solution was working with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure out in the stomach itself so that means working\nWith the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that come with some people are shocked co in Kenya a bit more fleet of foot ... you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of ...\nWell keep errands they didn't wanna hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental remember he said he had invisible Mentos\n... mountain that Iraq's got be Rosa Parks basis how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nThese men and women who don't just\nSit down and watch when this was happening\nAnd what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and which plants and now that's up to be honest before that we are yeah\nThank you for that reporting and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can cheat in again next week when will

fifty that she has ties to the Pentagon or you're told to be underestimated as an advisor that's all she greets us the attack from abroad you begin\n\nKatherine would learn about those reports and many more later\nIn fact she wrote a book about reading a file cold\nMy life as a spy investigations into secret police filed but when capturing first arrived in Romania she was an optimistic and ambitious twenty five year old with little idea of what Romania hadn't store\nI had been prepared by my upbringing to imagine that it would be a great place with people standing in long lines\nAnd I didn't find it to be that though there were plenty of lines I knew practically nothing about Romania I'd read a few books in English but my remaining at the time was not really good enough for me to read so under prepared scarcely begins to cover the states with which I went in\n\nOur sources character I sort of as a valuable purpose and intelligent predisposed toward on notice adventures she doesn't feel like getting sometimes being observed a big ...\nWhen you first came to Romania you pretended you are married or why is that\nI had stage for the first few weeks with the mother of the woman that I studied Romanian with as a tutor in ah California before I came and this old gal was a very lively Guerra less person full of opinions about everything [noise]\nAnd she said well do you have a boyfriend who have a husband and I said I had a boyfriend but I didn't have a husband and she said you might want to turn him into a husband and I'll I'll lend you a wedding ring that I have because it'll help you keep other men away from you\nBut you also write in your book about a strange side effects about moving to remain yet ineffectual personality changed\nAnd that if I nonetheless persisted that meant that I was prepared to bring unpleasantness down upon her head I've thought about that a lot [laughter]\nVery peculiar ah angle of vision but I can see the logic to it that you explain to you why she decided to do this when she said that being taken to the secret police\nHeadquarters was terrifying enough because everybody knew what was in that building and here they were taking her through its main doors\nAnd she also said that when she was quite young her grandfather was picked up on the day of her birthday and taken away to prison and they never saw him again\nAnd so she had always associated the secret police with horrible things so when these purple start out by saying well you know you have to know that we no longer work and the way that we used to like with your grandfather was she said immediately made her nervous\nThey kept saying was important that she showed that she was a patriotic Romanian and tell them anything that I was doing that\nI shouldn't be doing and uh there might be a little problem with her job if she decided she didn't want to do that and so one way or another they in a very gentle manly like way threatened to her\nAnd the second person that you you manage to meet up with had had a different reaction\nYes this guy just made me furious all the things he was telling them that were very personal like they'd ask him who he knew I might be sleeping with and he would come up with some names and things like that he\nTold me that many of the things that were in his reports were not things that he himself had known the officer would say who are you sleeping with and he'd say well I don't know and the officer would say how about you know a B and C\nAnd then the officer would say okay so can we write them in on your report so the officer was feeding him information that he didn't even know himself\nTheir honesty did that help you forgive or have you forgiven\nYes and yes there is a process that I went through of basically saying All right what right do I have to be so high and mighty about this what what I have done in this circumstance after I'd heard a number of people's explanations for\nWhat had been done to them to get them to report I thought I Can't swear that I wouldn't have done the same my son\nNeed to inform so was to protect their families or their jobs and so on and I had never been put to that kind of test\nBut you took it one step further you made a decision to go and try and meet to try and understand and engage with some of the officers who had been on the other side of spying that's right told us about that\nI was sitting at my computer one day in New York and I thought how about I look up some of my ... birthday officers\nAnd I got the street address but no phone number for one and the phone number button no complete street address it was just the name of the street but no house number and these huge apartment buildings that means you've got hundreds and hundreds of people at a given street address so I went to the street\nOn which he was ... and I looked at every single house number and name until I found his and then I went off and bought a bunch of chrysanthemums as any good Romanian visitor would do\nRang the buzzer and he answered and I said I have flowers for you and he ... me in\nSo I got up to the top of the stairs I was shaking like a leaf I thought my God what am I going to do now you know this is actually working\nAnd here was this guy standing out in front of his apartment door looking to see who is coming up\nHe was wearing some sort of khaki trousers and the or rather lose mustard colored Jersey he had a almost entirely bald head and a nice a closely trimmed white moustache and almost no teeth and I handed him the flowers and he thanked me and then\nHe invited me into his apartment\nThere was a a chair right next to the door and that's where he ceded me and the most marginal possible location and he stood in the doorway of the kitchen opposite and um then we started a conversation that was mostly me I was a\nReally really nervous and also trying to be the most engaging possible person so that he would be willing to continue having this conversation so I started to remind him what I was doing and he said Oh yes I remember that he remembered the name of my landlord this was from forty years before\nAnd that my project had been about folklore and so on\nAnd then I'm reminded him that I had been stopped going into a military base and I said there was it was perfectly understandable that you might have thought I was involved in spying and that was when he began to smile and then he sat down\nAnd uh the conversation went on for about another hour hour and a half and it was quite friendly probably bothered you long enough so I should probably leave he held out his hand and said ah\nCome again next time we'll go out on the town\nBorder to mean for you what did you get out of that conversation\nI got a tremendous amount of confusion and\nUpset because this guy was perfectly nice and friendly and he was smart he didn't fit my stereotype of the secret police person at all I had this\nStrong sensation that I had made a new friend and then the rational part of me would say you idiot you know this is ridiculous you spend an hour and a half with a former secret police officer and you think this is a new friend\nAnd you've said reading the father's ... strangely you started to wonder if if you really worse spot that's quite an interesting thing to say what did you mean by that\nFirst of all they had a number of documents in which they said things like she does the same kinds of things we do she puts pseudo names on the people she talks\nPer notes in a special code so that they are hard to read and so as I read the ways in which they are viewing me and seeing me as a possible spy I can see why it might appear that way\nSo they have a view of what spying is and when I Try to get inside their minds um it seems to me that I can follow their reasoning\nCatherine buttery that and don't forget you can see one of the surveillance photos we spoke of taken of Katherine\nBy these secret police just visit our

that she felt that she had surfed her time that she had accomplished what she wanted and so the speculation is that either she wants to go into the private sector and start making some money after all

veteran journalist and author Thomas Frank has long been a shop left wing critic of the party arguing that has turned its back on its traditional working class opposes and become defined by what he called smugglers and complacency which culminated in Donald Trump's election\nHis new book ... with oblivion reports from a sinking society ... what he calls a period of sinking liberal hopes I lost both to Thomas Frank on the news out on the day off to Donald Trump's victory so I often have the Democrats learned anything in the past two years\nBut no they haven't but that's not to say that they won't do really well this fall they may well sweep Congress this fall but if they do so it's because of what you know it's for the same reasons that that they always get rescued which is that the Republicans [laughter]\nScrewed up you know that you've got this guy in the oval office who is this unbelievable jerk who has a antagonized so many voters\nSo no the Democrats have not taken to heart any of the things that you and I\nTalked about so long ago two years ago now\nWhile you're not do you think 'cause they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see it as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go\nFor a you know the kind of policies at someone like that would put in place but that's not what they're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else is a category mistake that's not who they are\nThey also in in some of the front of me that they have gone full ... candidates in certain places that you had always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so are are they are they shoot sort of a different party already starting to rise up ... you know just I I'm Sorry I shouldn't\nI shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are the examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people who are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president\nBut are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about this probably unfair to I'm Talking about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class\nIn America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and\nHow would you describe that philosophy a it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine but the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this in ...\nDecades moved from the Democratic column into the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't it it's a short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nTo sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four with only two brief interruptions\nOr the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people\nAnd that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves beginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never\nReally recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give his chances at the moment\nYou know remember I had all sorts of ... there that I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he does if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThan all bets are off but the way things are going right now I\nHate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the\nFold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is if the country stays on the track that it's on right now the economy running flat out the accelerator down unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I don't know who can I remember the period of the Nineteen nineties when we had\nThis sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nOf the process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter what the other side does\nThe American
