Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming we're looking for any sort of electrical power that doesn't put see eye to into the atmosphere I don't think grunting false making a call ... of well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University stay the case backs sort of the power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic fundamentally should do with this\nOf the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter biased being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power winter that makes and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end\nThe atmosphere is one big heat engine it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequences\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind some might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because this mole solar energy coming through this because you don't get a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a tweaking but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region were large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to\nBe carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big effect you modeling is salons numbers of wood and phones\nYeah but one way in front of us and have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very international amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly venting the benefits of wind farms or what you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs and given the very\nI think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we decriminalize so there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter around race basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested some very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts birds what a kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from some of the power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point

burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you

this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David

temperatures down well sort of things does the report suggest might be necessary\nSaw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important that people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in a life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flight\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better call legalize they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and\nFive to seven and ten some people were saying that these ... and they say we know that there are some costs however\nShort term costs nothing equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of the next ... to ... that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what we can say that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the ...\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we have an emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we cannot mitigate we have to meet to get\nThe short term ... cases if I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to low I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the ... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with one point five\nPowers target for example I can see that now in the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how a manageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it was just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does\nThis reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for the ones who should today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already read one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree or forming business ... in the far future this is um one point\nFive to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this reading about far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for that down the road and finally\nThe report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to carefully managing managed to adopt the ... the poor of the impact of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law where he wants to come back and\nYeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and that they were just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other ... thanks to all these work over the past\n... years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly cities is making it easier\nFor the reason to global carbon price for instance that agrees\nNo but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics and the next section but I think what do we have to\nRealize that there's been um scholars and partly because high and working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level policies\nHas traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point that he's made all seem to report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not hard it's not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons okay only in that situation do you get to support you need\nBoth yeah so when we talk about costs here it's important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there are three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether\nWe make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety ... will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate\nOf about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively says that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast for now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ... case had\nAn you

to nations and their borders food security in insurgencies will all be affected by a changing climate in fact they already are\nThis week on day six the region's destabilized politically by climate change and what it means for global security [noise]\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nLet's hear from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they are claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that the ... say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this little seriously\nOh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's as in David ... they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believed defiance and they use the science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or a vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil\nWould want to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the government so the proof the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern to it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that's true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo innocence what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from of a fool for such us shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts of becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said olds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is Easter appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because of sea level rise is a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly puma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nNor at one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the u._s. hasn't gone with this had been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know kind of an energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very

Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo\nJoy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to us some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a loss in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency\nAt the same time let me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel\nAnd doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not policy of it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused\nThe problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the ... must take action cyst\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could ...\nTried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with those fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels all the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea of shifting the problem effect right and so I don't think developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\n[noise] the problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand I think that there is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains\nAnd that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow stopped him as in the mountains\nAnd Africa consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India they were really suffer and there's a ... for a reason to dig dead views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline ...\nSo the big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said once but I think any kind of well run the country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population effect population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same
