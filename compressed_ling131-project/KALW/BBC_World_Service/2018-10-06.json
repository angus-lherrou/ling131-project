been years since allegations of sexual abuse against many women over many years by the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein being first hit the headlines the outrage these provoked inspired huge wave of support for the me too movement across the world\nGoing to hear now about the impact in China are women speaking out against abuse and Harris meant\nIn twenty Fifteen a group of campaigners who became known as the feminist five were sent to jail for several weeks off to handing out feminist leaflets\nThe American journalist and rice a laser Hong Fincher has been following this story and the story of the other women in China who are fighting for quality a new book is called betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China and she's joining us you know do you do in Brazil in West in England ... welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me ...\nDescribed the feminist five voters a bit more about the\nShore hum well and twenty fifth Cain there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China and wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers at subways and bus station\nBut before they were even able to to carry out that activity the Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women today Jang where they put them in\nAnd held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually prevented and enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... so the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as you can preview unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nAre much more broadly defined really are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described how much will be representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise] well\nThis is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiteral debris muggy I shouldn't have a a word to as well I'm Emma may be a question for the\nMost high is it um I Wonder who use it as going today I mean how how can we see this in China now how would the effect to me to current day on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that\nThat it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles\nThere's very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where on the news about Harvey Weinstein sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations\nBut there is um the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed\nTo do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse and China\nHave virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women emerging all across China\nUm across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to ... to ... well\nThey a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the ... to hash tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when the me to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activist came up with the idea of using him oh jeez\nI'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging me to\nGet around and at at work for a while but then the rented it right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement to begin to manage it by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this changed so much with this with one child policy\nIn more than ... than there must have been a generation of uh weather this uh played into it that's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently show troubled by some and when you look at home and just audio Regina doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what regions of women campaigning for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written in to the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of the mouths of domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but\nBut there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grievance of these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home singer but just taught me to say thank you very much to Patricia ... and fuel companies morning and thank you for listening to this

S. fronts in India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand and solve his mental health and young people\nThis is the first time that I'm just being hogwash there's it's just ... talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing logging has\nAll the time most of the time and it was around treat the scenes and then you see ... population advice from New Zealand closer you've lost we buy and that can be used to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six besieged\nOf people so it's interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again I'm white\nIn your head and 'cause then I'll sign of it and then it it's just that levels are a bit law\nI have a few theories why might be around the composition of the coaches and New Zealand about a third of people come from ... um coaches\nIn particular minority coaches that the indigenous population and New Zealand and I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the click of his coach is on the majority museum and European coach I\nAm in terms of connection and the importance of of working together and supporting each other\nAnd now there is is maybe around at the proportion of one person households UCLA has a slightly lower right to that than the u._k.\nMay be a tool so to be with activities that John groups such as sports participation which she's doing well and and maybe it's the climate\nMost of the population will be in the up and move on and which means that they aren't really hip extremes in ... which is so these are going to be warmer summers and mild winters and most people close to the coast so they could be some sort of relationship around\nBeing out in about an engaging with the beach and spending time outdoors which is more difficult in countries when they were going to be quite harsh winters or way they are really hot summers animal periods where it's difficult to be outside because his extremes in the ...\nAnd they marched explain and the connections that people can create more easily\nCaught instinct did a study looking perhaps comparing the north and south Ogden museum because of course and then all of a challenge in grad oranges and lemons and and you know that the climate spokeswoman than it is in the ... be interesting to see the difference when it came to learning is\nYeah yeah and also in terms of rural communities and but\nThen I think that rule communities in in Britain and elsewhere in the ... will save the ... the grace of connections and closeness with neighbors\nIn the research firm wave looked at people living in\nGenerally independent couches wet people are more reliant on themselves and proud of being without until themselves compared with the empty dependent cultures within a more collective is that people rely more on family and friends one of\nThe things we found is that um people in the independent cultures value that\nRomantic relationship small they make more of a difference to whether they fail ... than they do an inch dependent cultures where people may have family and why to family to rely on as well not is just one pass and they'll be ...

I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven day\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero I'm guessing ...\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal into work\nBut I Do not oil we're talking about oh yeah that's my\nPoint is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener refers tests to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah do all\nThat stuff is in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives\nThat are out there I think it's very limited have long kept here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and ...\nThat's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw in the south pole and find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it\nAnd I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy at the put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get a false I feel is getting into\nA would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be doing until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline\nEvery year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ...\nOn on how you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know where he smoked\nAnd and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how soft states being built in ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil in competition with the whole as a politician and in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough to anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in Norway that it's become used to have I been working environment ... for for ten Fifteen they're such a moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our place to make their more renewable but where do you have to borrow do so well uh you get that perhaps\nIf you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see\nAnd the name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they're also part of the green shift so my point is your cat just had a switch and say let's start with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nAt the same time we have to address CCS Susie you because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... down of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time on this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universe dues for the algae is from the burned see is like to know the the wages they construct them up on the other end to thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we are\nCarry you wants to come back and she's yes it's definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... and yet what we need cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know they are shifting governments have spent quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and his staff has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years I think that also I needed to challenge to politicians say with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nWe were going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to less than what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC dull capital U. K. and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story Neal Pollack coughed up\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer in distributor of award winning public radio contest APO American public media with support from you wash your Craig bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experience\nForty seven percent alcohol by volume you larger Craig Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey orange term Kentucky think wisely drink wine [laughter]\nI'm Rachael ...

Ford at a campaign rally the anger this week among women is real and author ... says the rage is good this week on day six [noise]\nThat we have to pay so much more for that energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats unchecked because for a shift nation and I was being so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nRather than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and say well known love this\nUh the merit to I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to how the Grinch shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the American sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made it out there I\nKnow but it's ... it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change do you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and that trend fish now in the energy sector is really happening and it's happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it ... but my argument if you will see now that when you have ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by\nProducing and exploiting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new ... twenty five percent of your supply because actually dot pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an old uh gas\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the ... comes from home or if it comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies playing some people might not see the reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the ... trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in there and see and I don't think it's necessarily get that normally go to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so it's not a black and white picture\nThe ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe gas will exclude cold\nWave to court or lay on what you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nOn the market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables\nYell and would have to have to understand\nThey they are afraid they'll be able to carve approaching no but also the way the energy system works and seems to nibble energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe in so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments that but this is about what kind of you do we have for Europe pasta twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people that ... the the way which treats citizen says that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the um depends this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis his new way\nAfraid pots on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry when the hydro power on maritime shipping so we may develop a state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only places in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible ... so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on thank God we didn't have an ability\nWe we have a very uh since I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective is happening in the Nineteen seventies supposed to keep a moderate pace of the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sucked in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became a troll independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tide laid to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what I'm asking is it somehow psychologically has allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could stop the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nInsurers anyhow I mean we have we have a well\nFor a state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ...\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directory itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system for decided to solve it wouldn't have anything to do all of them of course we will lose your income\nBut it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world that through increase coal emissions because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points are now um\n... welcomed a

honest today to effectively in trying to find in the constitution that voting in a referendum to change an article in the constitution said that marriage is described\nAs between a man and a woman among is backing the change which is expected to be adopted different enough though to turn out to the Romanian Orthodox church\nFather you know it's a maverick he is it comes to the to the head of the church\nThat two things to be said here first of all it is not the church that they're trying to change the constitution is as simple site the initiative first of all and second is not about changing the constitution\nBut it is about let's define what the term spouses means because actually oh no let's say for example ... between the men the men would be possible which is not therefore we only want to specify in the constitution the the understanding of marriage is between the men and women as it is also stated in the civil law\nBut it's that need to bring the constitution in line with civil law or Rob that say a logical reasons\nOf course there are also a few logical reasons but once again this eulogy could reasons are not the ones who ... because if it was nothing the initiative of the church it was a civic initiative stuffed in from the coalition for the Senate\nBut nonetheless the remaining Orthodox Church is very supportive\nYes of course we are Christian and we support that\nShow you've said it that that marriage between a man and a woman in your view it has to Christian values\nYes indeed and I think that if this weekend the Romanians with the express their views on marriage and the constitution I think this is a legitimate voice in Europe\nBut she'll acknowledge that some Romania will be in a minority within a Europe most of the European Union countries ...

people who struggle with their orientation\nAs Christians we adhere to a for a simple for ethical norms are ...\nAnd how come to believe the church with the fact that whatever happens in this a referendum at the weekend to even if um\nMarriage is defined in the future is between a man and a woman that same sex couples uh we'll still have the right to live\nIn Romania according to um European Union little\nThe church has never being the posing people choose to leave this week is just the church ... in the end the Christians actually express their vendors about comedy\nBut to this changed the constitution or rather this re definition of marriage as between a man and a woman you creates a moral climate does it not to within the country about what is right and and what is wrong\nIt doesn't really change anything for the moment is seeing that the Supreme Court specify the marriage is between a man and woman so nothing really changes once again it's it's not that it for them or

this referendum has divided the country in a way in which you know the thing had done it since I remember for\nInstance for the first time in Romania I heard the idea of Romanian ... from the European Union so I think that is actually the tragic consequences of organizing such or a threat\nBe speaking to a priest from the Romanian Orthodox church which are not surprisingly as backing a yes vote in the referendum and his argument was that a civil lower in Romania or\nSo I'm putting the same definition in the constitution isn't a particularly controversial what's your reaction to that\nWell the other thing that could be elevated at the level of the constitution\nAnd do what they are trying to do is to decide what the generations to come right Twenty years from now it should be the society at that time that makes the law and not we should be particularly through the procedural manipulation\nI Would also say that this referendum apparently is about more defying a definition of family actually another marriage in the constitution which is not not the problem but in reality the ruling party and other on these shows\nAre using this referendum in order to keep our minds occupied with this\nInstead of paying attention to the other things that are real in our society for instance they're being all sorts of experts to mortgage fi legislation to relate related to justice\nThings
