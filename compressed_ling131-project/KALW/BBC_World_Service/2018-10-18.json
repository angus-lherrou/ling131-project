know we really had terrible the regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can prevent it stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recall them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens has been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his\nIdeas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will have often seemed invisible was that it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand and supremacy of markets is\nBased on the idea that if everyone\nGovernment intervention everyone will be better off just sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students that markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs and the only works\nIf you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted journalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith dinner argues the traditional economic\nTheories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity be self centered so unlike humans is almost a different species in fact some economists have
