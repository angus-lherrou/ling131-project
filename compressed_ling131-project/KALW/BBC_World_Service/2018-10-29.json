speaking to our correspondent courage to have a ...\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to the section rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they've found\nDebris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials\nWell the time of what they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believed that the plane crashed some thirty to forty meat is into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I I have to add but what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed with the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plain look like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea when do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of an lion air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any survivors and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nAnd doing Thirty years he remains like this to the point that when we had this car wash ... basically swept to wait ... great part of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party that\nWas on touched by corruption giving him an edge and this aura of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or was the vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... but above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate that can ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the ... que community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these common some concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid deans were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he did a I Believe that the president institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that are saying well we want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nShe gained a lot of strength and support particularly with the president market when he chose polo gadgets to be his ministry of

twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always felt that means that Brazil was the parliamentary system didn't guys that's presidential system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament to so the key aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition be\nThe the indicators that these relationship give we gave us a da da Da Nang six months for when you go because\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit to show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCan't go the other guy\nFor giant most ... then continues new president but also big challenges had\n[noise]\nCouple of years as being well it feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures of slugging beaches and trust the animals around the world\nNow some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging produce politically assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years of plastic the huge one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine beauty the tourists donors\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic some produce at home much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I spoke to ... vice presidents at the Seychelles weed out the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we have an ... two thousand tons of waste and exciting percent don't this is plastic waste so you appreciate the manager of the problem\nWe can show plastic but we do not produce any and yet we have such a large amount of glassy we also received a large amount of ... as a marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they own a coat refund this is unacceptable for the health and the

debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island um is this the social thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists that women they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and you as a mirror of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S are very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect to\nA beach or sees a Walter from plastic so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nOr to support or the government is doing to read a country of the plastic that we know ourselves but just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo this mission is just being a an ounce to get rid of the single use plastics a plastic container say they're trying to use once and can't be recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you when it\nWill make a um a lot of a difference because we we fight we made them run and only if we have a twenty percent on those words in ... joined up I think it's a beginning yeah I'm In\nThe beginning because there's still the deepest sense as you say who happens I mean it's a very small step towards sounds like a massive problem\nRegion and it begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a twin ... like minded but those who haven't joined us and I think the effects are far reaching beyond the twin\nDeepest and to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot\nFor us to get from those we are sure that others will join in because we all appreciate\nThat plastic affecting the health of our planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that showed ship humankind but also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have\nAs mentioned maritime vice president of the Seychelles trying to give a global perspective but if you look\nSteak waste is doing to his country say show\nIt's almost good night for me and James ... on the news they done Damon is here to tell us what's coming up on world up they're coming up shortly on the world\nSaying well we're going to follow

J. bear with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nAnd it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman\nSets about making rather cool free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences or find out more about what happened from total of ... as\nA journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile\nShe recently made a documentary called Chicago Boys\nThese guys were very young when they went to the U.S and the fifties they learn something that they never knew before these his open market and free market economy\nWhen they came back in the sixties they try to implement these ideas that they learn from Milton Friedman but nobody heard them they were too extreme uh extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ruin everything and that people would will suffer a lot\nSo they could go ahead with their abs of steel adequate at al even by the military and Pina ... came [noise]\nIt wasn't a fortunately for them to apply all they\nKnow that they get in their states under mixed on fragments a guidance in ...\nSo that the who and the takeover by a ... that gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free markets economics in America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the tradition up all the ...\nSo they knew that they they made Terry we're going to be strong enough to go ahead with their extreme economy policies so they saw this as a window to get into power and to apply these extreme IDS being supported by the military guns\n... what were these extreme economical ideas what kinds of things where they do\nFirst of all days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hands there is one phrase that they said when things belong to everyone\nThey don't belong to any one day we a distrust the state so they wanted to have that small state as possible so what are they successful they were very successful um they came to power with Pina tip more or less the same day\nTwo years later they were in control of most of their government and their civilian side of that the military dictatorship\nSo they control the economy ministry the finance minister either social ministry and they weren't able to implement all their idea backed by the guns from the military at some point\nThey're poor ... race to an unbelievable amount by the eighties we we had more than forty\nA job so people were really suffering we had people living in poverty we doubt houses without shoes on these was because all the national industry went to bankruptcy\nSo it was a very very extreme way off implement their their idea bought by this the force by by their guns or the military if anyone wanted to complain the military's came within arm's on they stop any kind of protest on the street\nThat was the I guess the short term impact of these radical free market reforms\nSome people hold up chili is an example of free markets success though in the longer term the economy was very prosperous and more prosperous than other economies in Latin America\nYes this is very interesting because it's too\nWe became the richest country in Latin America but since two thousand ten

plenty on the agenda this year last week the European Union announced that single use plastic such as plates and cutlery was to be banned\nThe member of European Parliament behind this Frederick Greece I spoke to weld updates on that day\nPlastic was a great invention a but since the fifties I Would say\nUh the production has been exponential I don't actually see that in English and now are the oceans are beaches are are dying from the past take 'em at the species are dying I'm at the fish are dying and at the end of the day we are eating plastic things plastic everywhere\nSo we had to act Europe how to act\nAll of that important as people meet in Bali to discuss the oceans the MacArthur Foundation is one of the organizations taking pot and we're joined by its pounded the former soda young woman ... because the un and thanks for being with us on well long days\nYou know the oceans very well in plastic has become an issue only really in the recent yeah were you aware of this before\nIn my interest in action packed it doesn't come for failing at direct Kathy from what I saw in the same but it comes from the fact that when you want to buy\nAnd you're sending around the world what you have on the back seat or you have you have to really finite result is a night very quickly transferred towns like that like like calling me when I finished my second round the world and ... like that in effect was different\nAnd my interest in plastics come from my interest in habits\nThe packaging is incredibly high volume thirty like value at the material and a huge amount of it leaks out in the ... a very different root\nCauses industrial foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce that\nWell the goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a second or economy which is an economic model which ... when I current is very lenient tighten might disposed we've taken a terrorist act the ground could make something after that\nAnd then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example\nWithin a secular economy you turn a straight line and you turn it into a circle that you design economy so that waste is\nEffectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generating natural systems what we're doing around plastic packaging never those three areas it's about being regenerative restarted it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it to the innovating around the packaging that we do\nSo that is one hundred percent recyclable combustible or we usable\nAnd then the fed area is to circulate that material once it's been designed to fit within the system and we have over two hundred and fifty cigna trees that we've collected\nFor global commitment which we don't here today in Bali around shifting towards that model by twenty twenty five\n[noise] intentions are great it's the enforcement that's going to be the thing isn't it that's not going to be easy\nI intentions All right but I think intentions are important in the right direction and I think one thing that's been missing from the ... everybody innovation ... innovating sorry and the right direction what we've done is we've we've put together a specific\nSet of targets together with the organizations the government to the cities the regions and also some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPlastic packaging will buy vote him signed up to the commitment already\nSo these are ... that everyone has agreed on we don't have all the answers to how to get that yet but we do have these ... and ... and every Eighteen months will be refreshing them so this is about becoming one hundred percent responsible compulsive will reusable by twenty twenty five\n[noise] um ... the only issue which is living with the finite resources of the snowed expecting to have stories of Christmas\nWell over the last decade one very very visible example to all of us because we'll ... we'll use it to something everybody understands but within a secular calling me everything that face to the economy\nNeeds to be cycle so that are the design of little plastic to be recyclable it could be anything biological it could be those road race it could be floating in the form of costs and it could be in the design says it fits within that biological cycle and regenerate natural capital what\nWe've done at the moment since we separated that the ability to be um to be a dilemma here economy we have\nToday from
