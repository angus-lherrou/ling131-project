recently I was surprised people were banned from having long beards and undermining Islamic traditional dress but that's all changed\nAs well it really does because the about the motivations for those that banning it was still communist and the the religion was seen as a threat\nUh ... what do you now have is of an an allowance and increase the freedom of religion but with this threat being imported into those countries from abroad to the extremist threat so how do they allow\nFreedom of religion without a lie loose and freedom of extremism that's the challenge they face an end to be

Ashraf are our guests here on weekend\nLet's focus on this now because each day the political divide in America\nGets white it's a fairly well worn phrase that now politicians pouring scorn on each

suspect accused of sending fourteen devices to predominantly vocal critics of Donald Trump has not being arrested registered Republican an audience Trump supporter fifty six year old says a sale ... now faces five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex presidents\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approve of\nYou know I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make lots of choices but their choices to not a include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that\nWe are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nUh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean the descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community\nAnd by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know I was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nThat will be people all over the world and not just support is a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book\nI'm like the alternatives that Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and go to all the money you know it's over\nOf the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where the gonna we're gonna be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\nA and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not California that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in New us\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's Robert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um\nThe Justice Department and I think that if he gets a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black yes\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but what we've got some middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics ... it's really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme\nAnd people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it and that far won't say effectively have the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so that much in isolation and that constant brand new in motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show with my identity is it's a multifaceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think a ... a stunted to debate which I Hope will be grab like people\nThat I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to do any ... ... ... it's not going to go way without even though he's so new indeed and a history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system that we need to understand it in ... and change it to the manager who fashion\nThe tension that's who spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want to know the value system or his policy in the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most is that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the power base and it is these these people that a hundred by extremists politicians who are anti democratic it's in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and cross but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French\nOne problem assume we're wrapping up in the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of people up you know there isn't the passion surrounding dinner and sort of liberal democracy is up ... am and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being a safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ... [laughter] regard it as ... black have\nBeen a guest on this edition of weekend many thanks to them hope you come back again soon affects you for listening well we can we live from London misses the b._b._c.

all cluster often that you have I don't know ... people dying eighty five Ninety exactly what's happening\nI ... and it's not doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell us that uh that that can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that because we'll altering but what we can say is it hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be limits if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on a buddy for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after a certain age or\nMaybe the race it which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet thanks class\nAnd I was I was saying when we discussed life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S slowdown in less than you might expect\nA lot of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and Fifteen people die from an opioid overdose the people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health workers it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people on the city streets\nNow is that a couple of weeks ago on the size of the

nuclear forces treaty signed by America and Russia in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe agreement was defunct tee off each with Russia repeatedly violating its rules on it also led to build up the bombs by China um tracked\nDuring the Cold War the ambitious IMF treaty aimed to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons delivery systems it helped to protect Europe in particular from Soviet

kilometers\nSo we'll just leaving the treaty means ... arms control now I almost on diplomatic correspondent James Rosen's first with Russia breached the treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and I live in a way to think about being serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the\nRussians think that aspects of the United states of nature posture in Europe and the deployment of

biggest single strategic challenge of the United states doesn't want to feel this in any way constrain perhaps actually from beginning an arms race with China which is then ended or at least reduced

bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ...\nWell that's turned out to be anything but true by one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer

for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nOn there are many who are asking if this another Saudi airstrikes actually among to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia on his no indication that they have any exit strategy\nOr all fourteen million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men suffering in Yemen this was my fifth trip but\nI haven't been in Sana'a the capital in two years I did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest recorded in the world and not nutrition rights have soared there are four hundred thousand children in Yemen\nOur trip we met the un humanitarian coordinator for Yemen leaves grand day and she was very very long on stock in her warning that up to fourteen million people could be suffering famine within a few months if there is no political solution on and I certainly isn't one on the horizon\nWill solve the aid agencies able to do at the moment to look through they think needs to happen now\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemeni doctors and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end the conflict\nAnd the great fear is around the red sea portion of a data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June ...\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the un and the ... these are desperately concerned that any attempt that results and fighting and deport would be catastrophic\nBecause her data really is the lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies fuel medicine this coming in through the data\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the children and so on they need permission from the two sides it's not always easy to get their operations are controlled and limited but undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies that have been keeping so many Yemeni is alive during the years of this conflict\nThe U.S is warming so rapidly that most experts agree that measures need to be taken suck carbon dioxide after the atmosphere to avoid the worst consequences of climate change\nBurning fossil fuels for energy clearing forest some demotion let plans all contribute to the problem [noise] CO two stops heat from leaving the planet one reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be\nScientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to camp to count them is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent not McGraw the\nProblem with these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of the scientists of and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices brothers would be boring things more psi phi end of things where you got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the midst of carbon out of the year\nThey can do that right now the cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nA very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove ... why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers the politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about because people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the truck they'll keep flying they'll keep using make to keep driving cars do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is carbon capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nOther lots of different things going on to the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do for a station that the ... lengthen the time ... tons of trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something that we can't very quickly the bigger more technical industry\nOr fired stations they're all they're in theory but very few and practices and it's really a handful around the world and the big problem with that course all these big bits of kiss cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hand in the caucus to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those their main using source of our sing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap\nTo bigger problem costs a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains were making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and I'll just report things we do more but how\nDo you incentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape ... was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking a lot of these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there'll be able to either share that technology with India and China nothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all that\nThe big challenges but China and India they remain on salt at this point\nThat's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for ... months happened and the next
