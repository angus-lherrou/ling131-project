assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events [noise]\nHurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\n\n\n\nDon't\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the central ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we think there's something wrong with coma\nLet me issue a mia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale fool wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signal and the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the dorm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in that the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from for the also which used as a great so long can you heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in the surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler area but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warm\nOur forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have\nOn moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and believe a particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the F F T that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in this set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light but Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that maybe why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\n[noise] it's marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months sea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some is recovering more poorly each winter\nJulian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about ... centimeters of melt since we had deployed than when she gets worrying because if it gets too thin and ... out then we lose our data\nJulian ... research is directly related to the climate slash whether issues of this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year round\nAfter the news on the

with a fellow Scott ... is a great crime writer but she writes a law in court gory detail about violent crime and you've\nI Believe for some advice and I just wonder whether\nSome times you fear that you run the risk of feeding us some more ... voyeuristic tendencies in in us to want to know about health and dismembered body what happens to a bar to use it as a sort of at Rhodes over time we were sort of intriguing where repels\nBut are you feeding\nA voyeurism in all of 'em I it's definitely there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime drama there were scared by true crimes done by a solution author fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nTo me it was important if we're talking about how a ... they can be ... if you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it will is\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slim\nBut those people who read forensic novels are probably more forensic clear where than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doesn't sign right so what I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and drift search what does it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to saying this is reality I Know it just made the salt this has actually how it would be a\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary\nYou've had weird death but what you do you do and I don't

nothing else or whether you believe having seen so much there there is an afterlife\nI have no idea but when I get there I suspect I won't come back to Talia [laughter] as as far as I'm aware and nobody has ever genuinely come back\nNow I Know that we have people who die in the operating theater and are brought by by by medical life but there comes a point beyond which you don't come back we

whether I just don't know whether it's possible for you to apply the same\nRationality and launch it\nFor example to your own loved ones because we believe in this room experience probably most of us about all of his experience death within our own families and I just wonder whether you when you experience a death in your own family and I know you've lost both your\nParents whether your feelings

within six weeks and my father took a long time to die because of all climbers on what was hard once they're dying\nThe deaths wasn't hard on them being that wasn't hard it was watching what they went through in the dying press pass\nSo whether that was painful whether this protracted\nWhether it was there was some whether they'd they'd never wanted to be um but when that came for both of them it was an absolute ... altered release for them and every body\nAnd being that they were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very shrunken but they were going on there was something\nFor a metaphorical thing as well do you do feel I mean again it's digging deep into sort of difficult things but\nWhen you saw your shrunken dead father did you feel that his soul\nAt my father owned by that point my father had\nBeen on believing the so uh so I guess you\nKnow because if something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done from as adults and that it was the most privileged place that I could ever has been\nAnd it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he's felt drinking he stopped eating he turned his face to the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last breath\nTold that you hear when they talk about that that frontal it's pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out it was the last breath than I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's ... but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last breath\nSomething changed but my father cease to be on the body that was\nHis entire life my father had gone he had died if there's something beyond I don't know until they get their thoughts\nDo you mean fear ...\nNot so tall I think it is the last great adventure you're going to do it once in a lifetime\nIf you're going in a long journey you'll always prepare for that journey why why do we know prepare\nAnd I think I Want to experience every single moment to offer I Want to know what to do like to do like if I can remember being born so I'd really like to know in those last stages this is what it feels like this is what it sounds like this is what it tastes like\nAnd then presumably I'll Remember none of it because I'll just dying\nAnd when you do your body to science and by ...\nI'm ...

to him from that now good morning Jeremy good morning\nCould this be the eurozone's next sulfur in debt crisis\nI think it may well be over the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that to to leave government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending proposals and tax cuts\nAt that time I haven't been the case in the sense here is that there are people that the commission can talk to an ... for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister but then the people pulling the strings and those pulling the strings to the leaders of the two parties and the coalition the leg up on the five Star Movement have their own plans on a determined on a confrontation\nWho holds the upper hand in a standoff do you think I mean at the end of the day at ... ... ... interior ministers who is the guiding light of the leg I is is is not going to back down and say\nI mean ultimately this this country it is in the hands of particular ... who now is the dominant figure in Italian politics he's the he's the interior minister but his leg up hockey has soared in the polls it's now much more popular even in the five Star Movement which was once billed as the\nThe the senior partner not coalition and he is determined to have a confrontation with the European institutions we just heard from ... to ... talk about the European Parliament elections next year\nMr Mr solving these dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels ... we saw for example when that bridge collapse in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed your for that Europe's failure to invest in a tiny structure\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here have come to the the the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seems to take on Europe\nAnd that means a major stuff over this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing had that in the end they'll just a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know who could they really take this to the brain can ... really affects the the markets that really effects and debt all over the years than\nWhat I think I think the the the best case the optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will disappear into government you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of low spread so that that the um it's a tiny and governments bumps guilt\nArising here but there was a Gemini and and at the same time you have people that ... I mean I was astonished his thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know just what's the difference between one hundred percent ... percent\nAnd there's no risk ... findings refinancing ... Italy's debt this is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and and it doesn't seem like government you know especially in your interview just now\nHave to include the but the fact that there is now there's competition within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so I I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two are doubling coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take in Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism with one phrase use 'em and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely does does cloud ... of the guy who had have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out by the EU why can't it and he just do the same it is one rule for them and one rule Satan isn't it\nIt's not to turkey and reasonable point and I think the ... there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most could reach the commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect who were willing to give it to the government to bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nA theatrical ... its its disagreements with Brussels but I I think the difference I supposed to keep people here in Brussels all in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that um budget rules they were led by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say you know to what we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit of it but\nThe European Union can't afford to bailout ... this is this is the ultimate he's a big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this this also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the euro zone where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nCountries like Italy like but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's the finances weaker and who feel that there was no ... years and he'd been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and then on the other hand you have an old and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new gang of\nA ... a in Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any of the risk chairing within the years and and that's all going to come to a crunch in mid December to sum it here in Brussels\nAnd that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise about some it very difficult indeed\nJeremy cliff the economists Columbus and correspondent in Brussels thanks very much for that he

action they PCC is talking about huge changes to the way we live I've been talking to one of the reports also it's business let's hear from the BBC's environment correspondent McGraw\nI Would say that in the past Twenty years is probably the most significant scientific report on the impacts of climate change that we ... that we've seen it sits as comprehensive it's I suppose the irony is that the closest that people get to see the problem the more clearly they can see in I think that\nThey would say that the room with one degree of warming in the world we're seeing more of the impacts and therefore it's easier to get the science to look at one point five\nAnd two degrees or that I won't say Twenty years ago so yeah the most significant one name in the last Twenty years I Would say\nI Am glad to see the the information in the report come from having to put this together\nYeah basically what they've done is they've looked at all the underlying science on the variety of impacts the potential for cutting back on emissions\nAre a whole range of scientific papers published in the last number of years some six thousand paper they looked at the distilled down into a report of several hundred pages\nAnd here in Korea for the last week that he's arguing with government representatives to try and produce and even shorter thirty three page summary which is what they published today and that's the key messages I should go to governments and individuals and corporations\nTo basically inform their actions over the next number of years\nI'm specifically on this report on what happens next where does it go from here\n[laughter] yeah it goes from here in Korea goes to Poland in December when governments and the\nAll the United nations basically gather to look at the issue of climate change and see how they can take it on and basically that meant to be there looking at how they watch it up or improve their ability to cut emissions and this reform would be central to that and I think you know what a small island states has developed countries will look it up and we love to go to Poland to say rice\nScience and say you have to do this you have twelve years basically the culture of missions and how what are you going to do and we'll see how the politicians react and\nThat was our environment correspondence ...

policy agreement years ago they decided collectively to pursue efforts to limit global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd basically they wanted scientific information about what about them wide so the country's gave the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change to homework questions\nOn the first question was what would be the in times of global warming of one point five on how it compared to to decrease which was the previous level of ... and then the second thing that they wanted to know was basically how it could be achieved so basically the report that we ah you know finally agreed on thoughts of date\nA was a report address these two homework questions it started with the government and the scientists responded\nOkay let's pick some of that what what is the

much wider what is the reaction been women around the country have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one delta\nAnd one woman who he helped deliver forty nine years ago but it's been walks across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting in his his history this is about opening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's pasta at least that's

long term difference but I'll tell ya I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they are trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't a short term problem this is this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today\nWhich is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels in in the business sector but it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about just now have jobs and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs were on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nYou probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old\nEnergy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line but this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change that carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult though hasn't it to get America change their habits\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued them we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since\nMostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pump\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for\nAll of us to talk about seizing large look at some of the extreme weather that America seems to be having to to do with more and more I mean is that having an impact do you think on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter and instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities let's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we have never had them before or the drought we're facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift every buddy up\nAnd move to a future that's better for everyone\nI feel like we're fighting about nothing\nInstead of grabbing the future in running towards\nAnd this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states do you think will just be seen as another more of the same that washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid MRI\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nAnd that was Gina McCarthy the former administrator of the U.S
