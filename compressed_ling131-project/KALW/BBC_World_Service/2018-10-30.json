Gulf director of the Marist College poll on the company ... and independent polling and election consultant first cat food what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds but I find\nThe most fascinating thing is that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate so Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care that means that\nIt's on an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they makes you think\nI I think there's a tone and the closing days with the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issue that is to talk about the importance in terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd bleed has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting 'cause ... there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweeting about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind\nThere's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nWho are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in lied to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effectively leading\nThe party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I also\nCan add something about ... we've had shootings in the United states and we had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovered what about Republican women\nTo women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship\nAnd how that affects opinion and what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged and be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party\nOn independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of back critical group of voters\nAnd the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that leaves these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a

the Democrats have this early picks side as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short answer from each of you how much music that the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate late\n[noise] well I think you know the ... and I suspect cat will agree with you know I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I ... how is likely to go democratic and and the centers like does the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who are on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who says I think that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse those old it was just as all these Democrats are states that Trump Card\nMay matter and golf director of the Marist College poll\nAnd Kathy Frank of it and then when the voting on election consumption you'll have your own

pumps or a loved one home the one time scale of all from the the awesome communication abilities of plants and other non human species on the next big picture science [noise]\nAnother example to the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nCitizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check that's a problem and is the problem that many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place give them a name\nAnd you get to vote but you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter of a problem where there isn't really a problem how'd you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\n... in the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of voting suppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking by victim to unfortunate packed into focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans\nDon't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nBut many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\n... and they treat intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with most surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who are suing said was this is going to press turn out\nThe number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready boom and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud\nI think it's a very small problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says\nThree million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there has\nBeen a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out ... you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeted solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution\nA lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating because of barriers that have been attracted to the ballot box of what evidence do you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws to reduce order turnout and at a reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color are these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas\nAnd Tennessee I think if you look at the end ten\nOr Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have helped them carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also it just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to participate\nAlso the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to froze I asked Ari\nIf you look at the case then from there were uncovered most of the time they were ex felons\nWho didn't realize they were in eligible to vote there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote
