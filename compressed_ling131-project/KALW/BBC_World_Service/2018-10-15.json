about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals um who think differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women and it's not surprising I'm often frustrated by it\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent of white women actually believe Dr Blasey Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean the gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I don't mind described as a problem\nI I get I get the industry\nMake common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving toward is asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pulled and groups\nOr many of us are I I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nI'm the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president they feel about ... because he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this ...\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GDP Americans not as well known since I said ...\nVotes from every demographic do you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to listen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect\nBronco bottom of actually walking rather killing off he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of difference um within a broader reality that\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nDo you know the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when wronged brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culture of liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and I'm I'm group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women\nThey're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a when a U.S senator who was the first a Democrat or to the elected of Alabama in a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges\nHow can we not only use black women as the whales and the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas that actually speak to them if we can figure that\nWill probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile

Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily\nPanic about assault someone else's harvesting that data particularly if they're getting a free service in return if it's a social platform or something else\nThat they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... of them it was just a ... weakness well\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners Lee served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's been many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Ken burners Lee has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of ... being posted that's absolutely\nCorrect and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property and negotiate\nStarting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you\nRelative to other humans but right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them a better bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the ah catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks\nOn the foundation of our democracy have open people

so called information warfare fake news\nBerries Anderson is the founder of scout they are it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the bolts manipulating the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially if Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally eighty\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said with machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that there's a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with a deliberate intent to anger you or to get garner your support right and it happens on both the right and left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into harden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior in specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if he were to transform Twitter or Facebook of these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it'd be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\nIt is due to the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political couple of days without having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think\nWell yeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be\nAnd they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and the normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on ...\nAre Facebook and those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially an architect id by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media can you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company but it hasn't yet happened not yet\nBuried under ... who suggests a variety of on says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those no they're connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized attack if ... if\nHe centralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture of these social social platforms absolutely yeah\nAre you optimistic that this is going to do we have a way through because ultimately we've all got to live with the Internet is not going to go away on invented\nComing I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where\nI think we'd outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I Am absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets Anderson who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of

familiar with the story that's the BBC's Moscow correspondent Sarah brings that to explain the relations between the various churches\nSound finish it complicates this and that but I mean I think the fundamental point in the two one is that Moscow is essentially cussing off all ties with constant tonight pull up which is why the economic economical patriotic fits now he\nIs the spiritual leader of North Korea say he's the man who's a usually referred to as the first among equals in the old ... said he has a very significant position in that sense now Moscow is saying that they will no longer a maintain its relationship with constant type ... stumble\nUh declare independence from Moscow not something which set Ukraine\nOut of the Chechen Ukraine has been a little campaigning for for many many years but not specifically picked up the ticket out after a twenty four team was of course the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the political crisis and indeed the conflict between Russia\nAnd Ukraine that's been raging now for some for ... ... it's a political a conflict is also deeply important religious a dispute that's now\nA broken out essentially between Moscow and Ukraine but has led to this evidence of ties which comes tonight but which comes some type of which does have implications for all of the old sort of ... because there's going to be a sense you know I think a bustle\nOf influence and power so many different chat just tall and in terms of their religion says juggling which stretches well for example the fact that a Ukraine has being allowed to independence or might encourage others for example ah took Bulgaria Macedonia to Balkans\nAh that that could be issues all all all set up to ... but it but at the moment I think you know the interesting focus is ready between Russia and Ukraine because the politics behind this has caused that we've had an awful lot about in recent years in terms of the relation between Moscow\nAnd Ukraine I think this is quite a blow full full of like a piece in himself and for his a position that he's kind of cost out for himself as\nA an orthodox leader he he stresses his religious devotion his own position as the head of of Russia which he's been re creating remote and if you like as a much more developed um religious country and up popped his his\nHis uh his image and old say part of his power projection and I think to lose essentially the Ukrainian faithful to lose Moscow's control over the Ukrainian church is a pretty significant blow for Russia for the church but also for peace and politically\nSo a lot of old and ... people in Russia will be pretty disappointed\nI think that well you know today I was at the the main cathedral hair and that was a there was a religious service going on that that was a
