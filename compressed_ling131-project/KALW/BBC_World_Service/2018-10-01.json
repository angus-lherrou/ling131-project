La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be ...\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh systems science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gruff tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual averages fool ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages early parts of the climate story ... ... the ... the masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public and to policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics\nRelevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless hospital to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nAll right let's run into what Iran is not necessarily a harbinger of what we can but I think the reason why we do echinacea or any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that they used to be quite rare and is now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here he is of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple attitude and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high stratospheric jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already\nTo us [noise]\nThat I value historic um Oregon saying the largest fire\nThese are the conditions lived and experienced\nFund and yet ...

what is on the table by the way I Am a click I borrow from the best\nYou mentioned the ... the national guard and so that's my idea this was John Maynard Keynes in the bedroom was conference not for the for the most dangerous thing that I\nThink they should buy more exactly but that's what we must do similarly if I waste is we\nWe must do we've just discussing for much of this interview the problems facing the European Union because frankly have a democratic deficit what so what are the other thing is they don't recognize legitimacy institution but hey you let me I'm Out we being some sort of a global institution that says something some currency who who we\nLet let me answer that question in may the size of Nineteen our movement is going to stand or the European Parliament elections and we're going to stand in Greece we're going to stand with our friends and colleagues in that in ...\nOf the time to think about it they were going to stand in Poland with a feminist to lead to political progressive particles that I Am we're going to\nIran in elections in it against elevating that's who we are and our challenge is how to create and not at the end of inclusive and as I knew that this completely human they stick on the nationalist and ...\nAnd you just laid out but you're going to fight in elections and let's face it you said you were a Democrat and you're going to walk the walk as well as talk talk and I respect that but if one looks at\nCurrent polling and you say well when you you'll wind the movement has been around for a couple of years but you on news so the fact you're from scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that pass in their house you owned by the way and grace we'll let you know listen bankrupt lead for they want to figure out what all they want to get to is this the only country\nCool for them is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom this so want me to you know the u._k. very well one in your view makes\nJeremy ... labor party different from so many of the other left movements in Europe and across the world today\nWhat but it has had to do with it because ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about bricks that is what I mean I was gonna say the Labour Party view and breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I Want to say you sound fusing issue if you're confused when you're facing a confusing issue are you a fanatic\nBut given the Kobus position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the momentum undoubtedly\nYou said it was it create that ... in this country\nThat British democracy and its role in the world and not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the bad side this gives the people who have Britain and unfortunately they do what they consider their position in the world and I believe that the judge has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied the economy's gross onto bubbles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing any assessment of ... even with that or is\nInteresting and so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of near liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way of left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money that the actual health service\nMoney that they thought they said stop the national health service off but that that very same time he did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye\nTo the private money ... thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances elected as an innate and to the collapse into thousand a night\nSo we know what I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald the the the current shadow chancellor of the extra care here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of that shit is given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each work on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald before there have been proposing angle so McDonnell about the program we eras things you've been saying society proposing precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social but fund where the ten percent of the shadows after every ... or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic didn't\nWhereas they revise the is leaving them up amongst the workers within those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conference he may go into the mind if I saw I Hope it does it is a very interesting discussions are that we must have even the thought is must have\nAbout the division between competed and labor but it differently statement once upon a time when and that sort of both the machine the machine\nMachine produced for the company but these days of Google and Facebook\nWhen every time you such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to concede that property the life over that intensive capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world that is doing these okay\nSo for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I disagree with you is\nIs there any way I look at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP in say she said recently found that knows that she said we need to topple this government and we can't do it on the ballot box\nWe will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of full of the ... the last time I checked illegal immigrants high is right now that your view when you kind of politics needs to go\n... ... let's be clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes off by extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the and the way that we support democracy so to answer that game I Am going to quote from with some church for\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of a sudden there's and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that this would break the faithful would answer to your question now whether the strikes are part of the political democratic process I Do believe that they are\nOn the ... we have to end a lot of factors I thank you very much for being on how to thank you\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut the shoreline this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really read top down\n... and that report came out a

and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects I mean it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand they actually use the financial crisis in the west\nStarted to some ripples through China\nUm and ah it was actually a toy\nYou can point so really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I

bit wobbly\nUm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um

um you know as ... the kind of famous British economist ones that are in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the

were the kind of more empathetic positive image the second interesting finding was\nThat the pity full image did generate more emotional response him it made people feel angry\nAnd it made people feel guilty that made them more likely to donate but what we wanted to find out was what were the other implications of showing that image and what we found was\nMade people feel repulsed at the side of

killings in Pakistan the fight comes from a very personal and painful place which we'll hear about later\nHow late it was bowling in a small rural village in Baluchistan in southwest Pakistan many goes then what did not an education when ... was growing up but her father to the\nSo she and her sister could go to school I'll eat just boomed with her dad was very close\nOne of the things that I remember it clearly is that he would put me on his shoulders and he would walk around the village\nAnd he would show me different things every time a different route and we would go around the streets me holding onto his hair and my feet kicking his shoulders and he would be very proud of telling me about the world while everyone stared\nI have to say even at like two or three years of age I knew that people were watching us and they were shocked at how not his son by his daughter was on his shoulders and by that he meant to show me where my place was in the world way up high then everything else\nSo his expectations have you with perhaps a little bit different to the explosions that most fathers ...\nThey were very much he knew he saw the potential and me way before I did\nMost of the girls that was a ... and they would be getting married and an an young as well as you talk about about together\nMy sisters and I would go back to the village and see that two or three or four cousins girls have been married off without even knowing\nIt's mostly because decisions like that are made behind closed doors and especially by their fathers but the other thing was that they knew that when they accept a marriage like that they're honoring their fathers\nSo it was very much in bills in our mindset when someone comes up to you and says hey your father has decided to give you to this person in marriage even if you're nine years old you would say yes father because that makes him a very dignified man and the society and hence it fills our hearts that joy\nThen there's the stores in that particular about you honoring you'll fall the un un un how you do the exactly\nBecause honor was actually ... associated with men as I was growing up anytime they would talk about on her it was the honor of men and how we have to preserve their honor and how we as girls were the sole people who would dishonor to them as well\nI remember one time playing with my friends and we were making clay dolls and scooping mud in my hand and\nShe was ... to me and she's like or uncle killed his wife because she dishonor at him\nAnd it shocked me because I didn't know what dishonor to men is and slowly I started learning about honor killings that is why and actually one time my father on me to come sit next to him and he asked me he's like highly\nDo you know how you will dishonor me and I was like this is that this is the day when I find out what is that one big thin and my heart just kept from being in my chest and I was really really worried and he's like you will dishonor me when you fail in school [noise]\nBut it also let me see my uncle that the fear in his eyes that the whole time that I was in that house he kept looking at me and believing that I was what the job\nAnd it was very very devastating for me to see and I was like I I forgive you said it in my heart and that is\nWhen I knew I forgave him but because of that I became much stronger and much more powerful and my work\nI mean some people will still don't really understand how you can give this bomb I mean do you understand how they think this\nYes I knew that I'm\nA former sell some mine would be very very much disliked my decision and would challenge me for why I'm forgiving him but I learned that forgiveness is not for him it was never for him whoever forgave him or anyone else they forgave them for themselves\nThe moment I did it I learned that it was because I wanted to be free of that bird and I wanted to be free to be more powerful\nAnd the moment my heart agreed that I have forgiven him I turned into that one powerful woman that I wanted to be from all these years and really challenge things like that\nNow on on the positive ... object can you move around the world and they've also ... to meet the love life [laughter] tell me about this I see how bad [laughter]\n\nI honestly I never really thought that I Would ever fall in love even though I was fighting against honor killings a deep down the same customs had taken root in my heart and whenever the mention of love would come my heart would be in a way that\nMade me feel like it's not something that I desire so my whole goal was always to just continue with my work\nBut when you first realize that you were in love with the reduced shouted American [laughter] huge didn't initially think oh let's let's just get married on the radio too [laughter]\nSo after meeting David and being extremely impressed by him and he feeling the same way\nI saw my father and honestly I I remember being like I Can't believe what I've done to him I Can't believe from all those years he gave me everything when I started trying he told me I was going to be an artist when I started writing he told me I was going to be a writer he kept\nWould be but I had turned into that leader and given him all of these illnesses and all of this heartache so I said that I Would do everything that makes you happy and so in that time I actually decided to marry I was about twenty four years old\nAnd by that time I should be a grandmother and my village [laughter]\nSo I met someone and I decided that I Would marry that man and fully intended on doing that and I introduced him to my father as well\nAnd turns out while I'm fully planning the date of the marriage and writing down in my journal about the details of the wedding and everything and how we would live our life my father comes back to me and he says that he does not like the guy\nI didn't like a a nice ... that you would be ideally suited for ... [laughter]\n\nMy father just likes to keep surprising me and keep giving me all of this heartache why like do the same for him he said that he's going to steal your light\nHe's going to take away your positivity and I looked at my father that is when he fully opened up to me he told me something that he'd never ever mentioned before it actually away from the family we were walking in a park\nSo that none of my other siblings here and he told me a story that really changed my thinking about him\nHe told me that when he was seven years old when he had just started going to school and he had started discovering the love for his education\nHe would walk to two villages from his village and go to that one school that was really far from him one morning he was walking to that village where his school was then there was calls on the street just like a village life where everything is normal even buy everything looks chaotic\nAnd he was walking through the streets when he saw a big group of men standing in a corner looking at something on the ground and his ... curiosity had him he wanted to see what everybody was looking at and so he struggled to push everybody aside and go through that crowd it was a big crowd\nFinally he so pushed the last person that was in front of him and he regretted doing that because right in front of him on the ground was a man and a woman all bloodied beaten to death\nAnd he cannot take this away from his memory his heart was beating so fast and he clutched his books again and went back to the street and went to his school\nUnable to take this image out of his mind in his class when he reached all the boys were laughing and playing and throwing things at each other and he just sat there remembering that image of what he had just seen\nFinally around forty to fifty minutes later the teacher walks in and he immediately went to the chalk board and took the chalk and he's like okay boys all take out your books today we're going to read this chapter and he turned towards the students and my father saw that his front of his shirt was full of Blatter's of blood [noise]\nLater he found out that he was the one who took steak and beat his needs to death and he was part of the murders that he had seen on the street and he had come back after that to educate all of them\nThis had given him this one feeling afraid that he had carried with him all of his life from the moment that he put me on his shoulders to this moment where he fought for me to uh to not to put my life in risky actually\nEvery time I fought with him he desired that I should fight harder with him to keep my fight\nSo hungry to talk to her father about the money she really wanted to marry David an he accepted it however bringing both of their families together was a bit tricky\nInterestingly his family is extremely sweet and my family is extremely sweet but then my family started saying some very mean things about his mother\nAnd his mother started saying some really mean things about my family and they were sitting on two different sides of the world\nAnd seeing all these things without even seeing each other down seeing a photo of each other they just knew that this can happen this marriage can happen for what reason both families didn't know why\nAnd two thousand fourteen I had a talk in Italy Venice\nAnd I decided that I'm going to bring my family there and ask David to bring his family we're going to have them meet each other and they said all the mean things they wanted to say than in front of each other [laughter]\nSo when they all came to Italy one night before that'd be canceled their hotel rooms and booked a small\nArea being be and put them in that place as soon as they arrived and it started on our most awkward as time of her life this one week they spend their we're sitting right next to each other and they had been saying extremely\nFearful and harsh things for each other in their homes now everyone was silent and so slowly\nConversation started and all of those conversations I have to say started over ... that my mom made\nAnd within three days of this meeting they actually started realizing that oh my God we're all humans they there are so many similarities than there are differences and that is where we got engaged in Venice, Italy and soon our wedding was planned\nSo I was like a scene from Hollywood Rome combs sports [laughter]\n\n... to ... and hope books cooled I should have on a desert so to have her on our website and one of the dumps forget you can touch with anything you might have missed an all sorts of gone to the outlook put cost so stay tuned we'll be back in a moment\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

o'clock in thirty minutes from now all things considered [noise]\nUm but they wanted to see these today it's I mean it's just the three of regional signatories been remain in place Robyn just becoming adults I may go say that they seem satisfied in Africa\nAnd and what about the handover of power both of these leaders the outgoing an incoming one is happy about it as each other well\nMr Lopez Obrador himself hasn't spoken but his negotiate his we'll see how they as you said we celebrate the trial offer agreements on the line and I try not to set it closes the door to trade fragmentation of the region\nNAFTA to as he could it which I thought it was quite interesting we'll give stupidity or uncertainty of Mexico's complex with its North American partners and outgoing president Enrique Pena Nieto\nHas said he'd spoken by prime minister Trudeau and President Trump this morning and cool the agreement a win win win so you know at this stage both sides so at least sounding pleased with the results\n[noise] thanks very much well let's turn to the Canadian side of things uh this is what President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to explored American wheat poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese you up\nOr some some likes or scoops of ice cream we understand but will the Canadians like this possible deal Jessica\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less though for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team not including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all\nHappy about it they're saying that it really this is putting their their future the future of their families at risk especially since Canada this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to its dairy market as part of the trade deal notably with the recent see to deal with the European Union\nNow this could spell trouble for Trudeau in the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec where there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what to do is saying today is look at first off the U.S we're really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also promising for compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some of the sting out of this concession\nAnd what about the personal relationship those being some pretty ... times between the leaders of Canada are in the United states in recent months\nBut they're also founding quite warm today what's your assessment\nTesty I think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump used today describing\nSome of the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair I think it was the most heated around Jew and around the G ... meeting and get back\nWhere true came out saying that candidate would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade a Trump came out calling him Meek mild weak and and that really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came to trade\nNow at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like a bit of a Potter too but\nThe Canada and us relationship has weathered a lot of storms between its leaders leaders have not always gotten along and I think that that ties do go deeper than than sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica ... thanks very much a governor don't here in Washington is a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes isn't the or the post industrial Midwest in studies which will be so important to President Trump and his presidential victory do you think this will have an impact on the midterm elections that are coming up\nI think it's possible and I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base of the voted for him to come out and say sign cute in central their votes was\nNever really thank you for things you've done our new for things you promising to do the farmers may may do the same but the president has up to sacrifice something he's given up for example these insistence on on scrap and will equal to shop for Nineteen policy of NAFTA which is the ... of\nOf all their own why on that and of course the other big thing was still in place is the steel and aluminum tariffs twenty five and ten percent Muslim\nOn count um Mexico those are still in place and the president decided not to be negotiated as part of this process\nGary are Donahue in Washington before that we heard from ... feet in Toronto and we'll ground in Mexico city ... ... is a Canadian politician who's with the ruling liberal

and in this particular uh agreements not\nEveryone is happy though one Canadian companies direct to the United states ... by not getting rid of the twenty five percent steel tariffs and the ten percent a highly medium ... says that had to be some compromise that are not all of your voters will be happy about\nWell not particular matter American president used to be to a national security measure that does is\nSeparate from the than up the negotiations to put tariffs on steel and aluminum\nAround the world including Canada and uh our government is committed to you know sporting industry ... billion dollars to play to support workers and the industry and to strengthen the steel industry and limited street for the long term that's one piece and they put in place dollar for dollar counter terrorists so\nToday the deal is very positive because it's moving forward in a positive manner and I've spoken with prime minister and I've spoken with stroke trade on August or they are committed to\nGetting this positive the momentum to continue to negotiate ing and getting rid of those tariffs because that will be a win win for both of us 'cause of businesses are affected on both sides of the border\nYou started your comments by saying the U.S administration is fundamentally protectionist that's no change that has it and despite this deal us still going to have a fight on your hands to keep the kind of trade that you want with it you\nGot to keep you know redouble our efforts and I think that's why this field is an extremely positive step forward\nAnd we've got to keep on this momentum and just keep working it's obviously we have the number of months ahead of us where we roll up our sleeves and continue to work\nTogether because we've put dollar for dollar no steel and aluminum but we've also put tariffs on a number of other\nSteel products and it will be and everyone's best interests for us to to get rid of those tariffs that you were thirty two which which is essentially\nIt doesn't it it it's not good economics it's it's not good for anyone so I think that cutting off the ministry and putting the two ... two on autos which would have been devastating for the economy is on all sides was critical in this agreement\nAnd all sorts or the steel industry because that's one of the number one non places where the steel ends\nAnd briefly um than President Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong un yesterday do you think he's back in love with the Justin Trudeau\nWell I can tell you what the minister Justin Trudeau has been absolutely amazing a ... a a
