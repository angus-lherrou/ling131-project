harming most other businesses you say you're taking a law if you'd away from us [noise]\nSo in this back and say you have professional to better also sitting along with us along with well India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than they are not taking the business of\nHis career nine points to go ahead what we find there's obviously politicians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair up and get us faster than to be told it can't be retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say we're taking it to retire us so we take out some of the expense or on the person is going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC got paid time have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair she'd become cheaper\nNow for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is sex tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that's\nA professional repairs have become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different\nOn labor costs in different parts of the world are so\nYou're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nOne thing I wanted to talk about and I was you know for the solution to work in terms of course we're allowing people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I type\nWhy what becomes to protect today and I'm Talking some topics I made a half [noise]\nHello this is the gold and children's broke yeah yeah he found that if I Can't say yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair rule I don't know if he's a so frightened metal is how holes in the ...\nMean I Wonder when someone could replace the metro pose\nIt might be able to taste and buy from even thought of that just I just think it's just easier to get rid of that so they may they might have been ... is it is it the time as well during the time yeah fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just started raining here sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it that was\nWhen you put a hold on lens and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um Georgia a point where they can't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so that due to the bottom could you ...\nThat you can try but that's not really much point that it wasn't anything to take it to patients clean around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the option to put man it's just\nIt comes down to the fact that ... into the working older about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that I was a real Harry ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour lenses and we're going to put them in the world is is this little applause has been no I've already been up here and how to look in\nWe should really be doing things to reuse things but it comes down to practice county if does only says she proceeded\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew it couldn't is going to be generally cheaper than able to quit when I Need a better job\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder if in a pound of people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously of people are pretty busy day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around who are very conscious about their environment that that same background we get in some parts we get ... response because\nPeople want to do that ... in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing a lot of the thoughts that things don't go to lunch and\nMost people I Wonder if you could kind of a ... some of the people here in this Rebecca say you were kind of preaching to the compared to the head for reasons because now that already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who\nAs we heard from the people are able to acquire average is first of all we're\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack cafe when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that when it's a precious broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you time and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... say they don't\nReally expect things to be read that\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWe're running short time no disrespect cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing the machine the pull to polish the chapter with a large Sean and get him into the workings of the device some fun with ... mostly in a way to start to going to be in ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be\nBut we also hope that the manufacturers realize that product should be re parable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you can principles back home to\nTo fix things and you don't have the will stretch away\nThat movie challenging but uh maybe in the future you love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean I think the future of prepackaged face is as much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe and it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships hunting slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken items with Paris hits it hits connecting people with each other [noise]\n\nMy thanks to everyone to most ... Chris in London and Chevy ... thank you for listening to well if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a video from ... so it'll be that soon\nWill actually be back next week for most of the nation from around the world but for now I'm all for most a clause in how to repair and electronic say this but it's a I Know I'm going to go well come from my wife has that comes back fixed\nAlthough for others and I ...\nThat maybe that's the problem\nOf course if it does get fixed you know I'll shamelessly crime all the credit\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

and everything is very ... and the people are waiting for that push\nBut let's talk about Kevin ... who is in Barcelona what's the situation is one in ...\nI think the the basically we're in a situation where the petitions are looking at the ramifications of last night's two things went on yesterday we had the huge protests through the streets hundred and eighty thousand people largely peaceful and then separately\nActivists some say on more extreme and the CD all the committee for the defense of the republic now these these uh hundreds of thousands of people and we didn't you know there are many ... to ... between the protest now what we saw yesterday were two things one is the you know that there's been cutting off of\nA train nine for the rush hour for the for the calls\nWe've seen that before we haven't seen before all with the core of about two hundred people on the storm and breached the barriers outside the cat in parliament and also by a and this of national police station in in the center of both of them now and that's what led to clashes for protest to finish this he's eleven o'clock last night\nAnd the group of protest is up to the doors upon them and then they looked to be storming parliament's at one point and riot police came in\nUm ... we used to using some projectiles that a brief clashes push them back\nAnd I think what's happening now of ramifications looking at the slights fault line now in the independence movement which is you have the president came to ride the separatists catch it on President who said yesterday that protest district keep pushing it's working\nSo now the have the prime minister of Spain at ... percent yes who said on the radio about an hour ago that that rhetoric must stop that he needs to calm the radicals he said otherwise we're going to see violence in Catalonia so I think that's where we all this cool elements that some particularly Spanish\nPoliticians in Madrid believe the catch them presidents\nHas almost a just tacitly to do things that perhaps previously they wouldn't\n[noise] Kevin thank you Kevin Lee updating us from Barcelona when groups of whales are found floundering on beaches usually meant that means that got lost and confused and sometimes they can be guided back out to sea bought\nThe discovery of sixty eight trivia whales dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem with the put it into context to get to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to on through brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is sort of listen to what we would normally see in in ... when the usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming at a show of incredibly decomposed so [noise]\nUm we we actually had an investigating this less smoke pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed off and then they die that dead when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales are exceptional\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold mass running events where we turned up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the ... of some of them on the beach some of them lives in them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out why they're struggling happened in this case it's it's a very different picture\nOf what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of I'm a very unusual species that's being washing up I'm light from the sort of the the go away by an island all the rights to the top of Scotland um so\nIt stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea\nUm but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year\n[noise] so in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species or it's\nBy ... by these these class substitutions I'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight to these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which is\n[noise] they live very deep and the water they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um that they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf hedge survey they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal um they've been clocked to just a\nUnder three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid and um these the square to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash his show is very limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because of in such a extensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species\nIs particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... on the water noise in an in specific the effects of mid range segment on that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf age\nI'm In the last couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise into the million and bottom\nAnd the ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed it does I mean we we've we've made the oceans divide noisy place and I'm not so that sense of the general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that they ... out of the people that off the lights the Midwest and seven all off in the military and developing information from than can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military up like a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on a social useful locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive at a national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging\nHowever what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not this a noise is a plausible reason that these animals ... so we want to rule out all the other things that could potentially have caused them to strong such as toxins infectious disease\nI'm I'm trying to establish what what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\nSo many questions
