I don't always have a\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if that has something to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration okay\nKenny like he's to me through how either from page to final put up take what are you techniques\nSo you know they gave me the song I go back I can listen to a song and we didn't see snapshots of pictures in my head like I just see like steel frame and then I just have to read those things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't while I'm brushing my teams that played when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm sleeping with a pen I just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as usual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea [laughter]\nA hundred percent I don't know how I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I shouldn't say about it and\nKnow and then of course I think at some point as a liberal chalk that has come in in in my career based off parts of the of course it gets\nNeed to do I because I'm equate deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last ... plus one plus one not pitching while sending an idea very passionate about it I can see it I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look at just you're going to win the prop eventually the entire\nVision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know let me let me I can get 'em\nGimme talks about repeat to listening so the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you always subliminal on me so I guess you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like to make it as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging and ours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just have to come up with an idea and like heart for the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success show\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out because there's a lot of direct it out there\nIt's the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy project that's a that's a larger scale I mean the orange in each of working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not genes look beyond say\nYou are listening to the conversation I guess all too rude winning music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so your booth operating at a level where many of the office he worked with all huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think it can be specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating to send ... holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody when something a little bit differently so just indulge me yeah\nYou gotta understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way because I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course drops doing medical citizen male dominated field I'm not ... the added cross all starting off\nOn television so I was the person that now want it to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that the only weapon I had was at the time to get the opportunity to knock it out the park the fuss\nWas a music video for an award ceremony at I was one of those and they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know I Do not like you know I'm the director now and it's like yeah I mean what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that\nAnd I mean I'm not just one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be as visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like it was like actually love this treatment and bite off you know the\nI call with this one and I need to make a decision on to them I said you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\n... me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that chalk eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten long boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business hearts of you know a lot of people call me the New England while I'm a girl so [laughter] because it just the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of you on hold ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThings on charges that things are charging a debt pocket their partners like I'll give you figured it projects do that I Do that for nothing at all but that would lead\nMe the most money when they came to me my budget it was a little bit too much for them I really loved the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone I needed to work in this project right\nIt's an effort is going to be given to can get\n... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because it does a rule of thumb that older actors get ten percent of the budget\nIs it what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget or we took him out of hand hundreds allows us donors and we took me about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work so you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because\nIt's a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and actually just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of cash in your pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean ten percent of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nCan get in your experience how a male and female artist treated differently by they record labels\nIn my experience and is obviously general conversation doesn't apply to everybody of ways but it really depends on the artists and like how much they already have to bring to the table but if it's somebody who is to be young and like a little bit lost to North shore and that super talented and have an amazing voice and\nMaybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with other writers so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more with women\nComing up after ... if ... if yeah back in that we're talking about people who can play traits in our minds that they're not magician scientists and engineers I'm not really sure that the the note sinister\nBond villains yeah these people during intend to take over the wild do they do have some unusual conscience to manipulate our brains to try to solve some problems facing the wild right and why are we going to be hearing they sound [noise]\nIt's kind of a digital copy and somehow even if you're feeling anxious or stressed out it can trick you into feeling much calmer or at least that's the idea and we're also talking about late this year yeah no as scary as they found\nThat actually helping people with

Popeye sets up ... with a company that create devices that help people with the general newer logical disorders\nSo we've got the product here and started at small shave\nNo it's not it's a shoe attachment directing traffic is only use as a mechanism for securing the actual books which is on the top of that so\n... says she's talking about quite high tech\nThere about the size for much folks and there's one on each phone now when he switched them on a laser beam projects on the ground as true green line a few inches in front of each ... who has a guy I Try and get on and see how the swat a size ...\nShould I get up and I have a walk and you can guide mayors to\nFlourish should be placed in them so this is who've been reading straight foods I've ...

she works closely with professor ... blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and and you wrote adjust\nThe essence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nIs defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that\nWill traumatic ability is lost and people with Parkinson's but you can actually do the trick the brain by by policy that automatic pilot which is more or less discharge engine of the brain by consciously\nRecruiting the motor areas of the brain so what the losers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing or allowing them\nAnd in doing so good by post their defective automatic partnered\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the automatic way of moving and walking which we all take for granted is damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way\nYeah another really good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues will care style as\nSuch because the styles going up ... visual cue obstruction by policies that effective power for the sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks Brian by constantly placing a cue\nAnd from out who as we heard of ... or the or has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and runaway stations this device is pretty

have to pull on my leg some holding like putting it around the corner for dragging myself along the the unit\nAnd then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to say let's let the castle

those same with the shoes on it's still hard what but it makes it possible to do those things is that Islam is impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like in these issues than have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that you can get out of a freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes I think crashed quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait to the medication to work at the moment\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by ... move call put them on and she says there are other limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the ... so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the San Francisco that\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she caught me freely fever lasers on south one of the ... or independents not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out by the help so do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\nSome study was done and it showed the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants of medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was a decrease the episodes by about but he's seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size or in the Nineteen participants in the study\nThat small and I wonder how do these shoes ... do they make it stand out to a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the uh the models of this ... someone in the Netherlands were on a train on it caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon well from what I understand what puff have really refined\nWho is going to generate tension ... she's in public and they chose attention to something people might otherwise one to be quite private\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas gospel and later she both of them are about manipulating the mind to make a fear or act different and they and my own food waste we can treat the brain fall out of the ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area of what's happening is wearable tech startups like ... and she's a kind of tracking you are a scientist a lapse and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker\nPreviously they would have been but a lot for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of stops and you're a scientist and professors and you are assigned to show up and speaking to have said that it's very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nAsinine thing and Q A ma and things to all of you for listening to all tax if you want to see those later she has an action go to our Facebook page we've made a video about them and

sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these movies\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impacted the n._r._a. finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting facts of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty eight ten mid term elections they are spending far\nLess on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of between the fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the end All right for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal miss support for the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment ...\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and to us than had some fifty thousand signatures on it but what we were really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement\nOn this and we believe that we have to take action based on what the machine and went from in front of them primarily in our social media channels so would you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and really trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision the the vendors that were impacted were long\nKenyan vendors are bows whose ethics were posted two hours and then to that from the holding company so they were very real people um that I was on the line to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so I mean essentially a with the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your show products made by this vista\nAre arms or ammunition yourself Mr out during the manufacture of those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey make up for sale I don't think it's been sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this for the ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S in his former politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the un RAs influence anyway the key\nThing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money\nSo much as it has been the zealous loyalty of its base of gun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend a meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities than the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the un arrays fine and swimming alone despite its claims of publicity\nWell and the ... does have money problems they spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle that gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump\nThat contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on to the American media in recent months and\nTheir difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off back in the Nineteen sixties one household and to have at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than eight\nSo let's hear from them rich and Mary Wilcox oh too long to gun owners\nThey live in a rural

I've been a member of the an array for Thirty years they support you a hunting accident or somebody breaks into your house and you shoot them you know legal fees\nThey just had somebody just recently just shot somebody in their home in the area of a like a burglary yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my postal all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun it gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that\nAnd if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns\nLike Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control it's like you guys for how'd you guys see that's now\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem it's a mental health problem education problem it's\nSociety's problem I mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you'd go to school to be guns and hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks\nThey had shooting classes in school nobody got shot like they did okay nothing it it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem so if you agree or they're going to outlaw guns the only ones are going to have guns are outlaws they're making criminals out of every day people\nI mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns and controlling who has them but you can't you can't just blame blatantly say no nobody can have them\nGood because then you're going to end up with just bad guys having guns\nRich and Mary Wilcox from a town called water for the New York state well they may be a Gulf does all the new anti gun measures that they're seeing but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to cure Linda fink progress\nThis is a critical midterm election this year and I

not the only one and we see candidates like this across the country\nI think the environment and the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the past\nHaving voters energizing galvanize over something like diamonds will help candidates at all levels I think we'll see facts all across the ...\nCame alone up one of course going control is just one small issue affecting voters
