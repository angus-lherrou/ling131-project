Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease or lung disease all the major ones as well as the more kind of non specific you know people get more frail less resilient\nAnd sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play a very important to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three wakes felt that make them water from law does a puff subject yeah\n[noise]\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the worms micro biome would it live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside one gun tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find him feel cases anymore not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty\nPercent yeah that's extraordinary\nSo you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool four and a half\nFour and half yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected yes I think scientists sometimes we do research is kind of like gambling [laughter]\nSo we have some crazy idea than you know a ... way to test them but you never know why they are idea is ride around on those moments where you\nFind that rates out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different micro biome give worms will Tony a longer life but a better quality of life in their final days\nSo they're way way way way kind of look at how well they they have when they're older they called worm when they're getting older their physical activities decline so they move slower and also become a little bit of a card in it [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own wild younger one's regular ... around in the older ones moves loaning the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed rank house but it can tell that body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes most any wrinkles around will quickly and their old age that they would less susceptible to disease to\n[noise] main one is now carrying out tests on mice to see where the changing them like ... extend their life and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome of my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can they've to two hundred say ... years so personally I think ...\nWe had about ... to get us to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome ... give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions or a bounce addressing the symptoms of aging\n... to ... [noise] well then if we can go straight to the schools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness\n\nHeart for fighting you're so but I Do oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people I have had got in touch with me\nThat loan Harry's professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. a scientist who's ... aging is because a lot of people excited\nBefore now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI work all begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves so\nBasically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues tomato different types of cells now sells got told that some cells and say you live our oil kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ... and\nSome lessons comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what's happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle\nBut instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive money\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells run them ... it's almost like a self saying I I'm an old south\nAnd you guys had been around here about the same sort of a ton of I have so you must be able to see you should be thinking about ... does well while so it's almost sort of contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive to cells around it and just messing\nAs we grow older more and more of a cells becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\n\nListen he did they make the cells around the age of Austin these innocent cells still functioning as they should which is thought to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension concept type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Harry's wants to know whether she could get these cells still behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nWhat happened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was finding ... seats and we have some old south\nAnd I had some chemicals and she suggested ... percent sure that some of these chemicals on these old skin cells and see what happened about a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me and when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still looked like ... so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular die that we can put on I felt coaches the tens blue if that's an excellent\nSo when I was expecting to say is that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she ... they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said you've got the wrong cells these are young sales go through it again and that\nAnd she did and she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she brought about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's bad that it probably ... how many rogue city services oh probably\nAbout nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look for the simple actually maybe you're on to somebody had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible she'd effectively\nHarry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the world is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan think loan Harry's will be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses instead\nAs human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up in\nEither new generation of empty degenerative drugs with all the way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people who would have died at age will then go on to live than not loaded lifespan\nSo how long can we live we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song and from what we heard that figure is lucky to ride\n\nWith the discoveries of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro biome and still ... cells aging how many years ... to settle what if we go to ... protection if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five\nBy the time we get that twenty one's sixteen who knows what else will be possible [noise]\n\nThis inquiry was presented by me having a merryman ... my best to take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes do download our podcast there

casualties on the economic side the crown prince has proposed the building of new eco friendly megacities in the desert aiming to diversify their country away from its oil focus\nHe's created a huge so bring well fund valued at some sixty billion dollars now energy expert Ellen a wall is also of a book Saudi Inc she says much of this cash has so far been focused on foreign vestments not in the country itself\nThere's definitely interested in making investments in companies in Asia and in Russia and in Europe and now Africa is also being talked about the focus is on making investments that then team at a localized in Saudi Arabia and that remains to be seen whether those investments very well be localized and by that contribute\nTo the Saudi economy and just how the employment in any real or effective way\nIn which case how seriously can we take this reform protests in terms of the country's domestic arrangements have there been any clues at the conference itself this week\nThe absences are without a doubt noticeable and prominent\nBut the question is whether that rovers health and fitness being withdrawn from the region and that's not something that we're seeing this stuff and lower level executives attending the conference I say you know they want to\nBe in Saudi backed the image is still important and that's why they are not\nExactly we Japan's softbank I think was one delegation when they went to Saudi Arabia they didn't go to the main conference so I've had from another Australian outfit those done something similar\nAnd much more prominent if Russia and Asia and the majority of the future deals with Asian companies they're mostly in the oil and gas and transportation sector for of technology conference I mean obviously those areas\nInvolve a lot of technology but it's not the kind of technology focus companies that we saw feature prominently last year\nOne thing that surprising to me is the reports that the conflict is still packed out I mean despite all the absolute teas and there are many of them that they still managed to kind of a standing room only isn't it by the sounds of it\nIn certain sections that definitely been standing room only there's definitely a very heavy presence of Gulf area individuals\nSo essentially if the Americans are all Europeans with staying away it's pretty easy to find others to step into that that place\nIs definitely a recognition that there's a lot of money that the government is still interested in putting into their not stopping this diversification plan they're stuck on solid with it is still a desire for foreign businesses to come in\nBelieve me I had been some and in his speech to the conference this week praise for example the head of the French oil group too tall for being one of those who agreed still to attend despite the controversy\nThan he suggested that loyalty by foreign trading partners like this would be rewarded there is a clear push back against the boycott from others\nThat's typical of flight Saudi tradition ... dead but at the same time house ventures in setting largely been around ...\nAm companies can't really seen after a short term towel doesn't seem concerned about any negative PR from attending back their investment we've never really in question there always we're always going to go forward with nothing ever happened how\nAre you anticipating a change of direction from Saudi Arabia how will this play out in terms of policy irrespective of the leaders\nIn general I think that they are committed to their economic diversification plan I don't think that would increase any other types of reforms the main focus is married on improving the economy improving employment through major investments from the government I think very top down\nApproach and I don't see them changing that anytime soon\nNonetheless do you think this week it's been a shock\nYeah I don't think anything will change but I Do think it has to shock\nEllen ... president of trends bustle consulting here on business daily from the BBC went away from the questions of oil and diversification arms sales have been the big news focus this week

want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a highly should they use the word that's a pretty harsh words for the show\nSo what does the overall state of West in arms sales
