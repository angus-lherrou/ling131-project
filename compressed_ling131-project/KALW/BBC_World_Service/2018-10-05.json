most people express their discomfort it like that's the language that we use\nStaff told me that even the what used to describe eating disorders themselves didn't fail right\nThe Chinese translation of anorexia it's actually teaching food disorder I think it's just very misleading the way that um it's name in my particular case um\nI I Love food with like my whole entire heart like food is life

artists in Cuba\nWhatever the state says whatever that particular awful are required to in a sense of stumbled approval from the ministry of culture to allow them to continue to work\nAbsolutely and not only that if you decide not to do it then that will take away your permit to be an artist like they have already done with some as a test meaning you can never exceeded or by art or sell your art or do anything related with art and in the country\nThey will take your equipment and your instruments in your house your cars or whatever they think is helping you to do the art or you are using the process of showing the art [noise]\nAnd unfortunately I think that creates a problem is when they are not many there will be a huge space and here's a vacuum that can be filled with corruption that

it's a sort of ... around in the same way here as it is I guess in a in Western Europe and and ... um but I mean I guess I'd say that that is being twenty five years of open society here and however

we've seen ever since\nI guess getting back to climate annexation of Crimea than eastern Ukraine then mh Seventeen and that they stay in school to know the rest of it is all about saying that we

mean that may be hundreds more bodies buried inside but it will be also very very difficult to ever find everyone on so that is one reason suggested that these religious may remain\nWhich is a tragic

they're asking the question they know they're right on ... on they asked me your name is all and I said no because it's true and they said on this a screen how do Iraq when I'm saying truth because he knows for sure that I'm saying truth\nAnd then I was lying because men the U.S is your name ... and I said no they saw a holiday I direct\nAnd it was quite interesting because in the end he said that I'm at first supplier for them because they can they clear and they see what I'm saying truth and when I'm lying\nSo we didn't just the first part of test my goal was just to show how this test works

put ... in a room you haven't seen before they put in some wires and you really took me ... minutes to keep calm what was your conclusion than\nI think he can really trust the graph if you know that

and then that thinking about lessons in these recent experience for any actual ... he's an Afghan journalists with BBC Pashto and was in Northern Ireland to ... a series of games\nBetween Afghanistan and the republic as island this came from a cricket kind in ... also known as London Danny\nI went there to cover the cricket cities did with buildings matches up between the two sides to have played a one on one end but the third one was affected by then and it was it ... it was very interesting experience not only about cricket I'm personally a fan of cricket\nI played when I was it a few gee in Pakistan we learn cricket that\nI also enjoyed the most federal London dady how much did you know about Northern Ireland before he went\nAs a journalist and we work on this subject a lot about the troubles started in the late sixties boom bang heads they're fighting killing thousands of people were killed or injured then good fried egg demand\nBut when I went to London day\nI spoke with people my concept or thinking well that that a lot of people missed two on two separate itself from a British Rule I gauge their talking with people there there are some people who are missionaries who may want to join the republic of Ireland\nBut with the young people I spoke a majority of them didn't have that type of\nThinking that they should leave the United kingdom or British food is it a generational thing I was told that those who are older and they might thinks their their mission to that\nBut still there might be young people who are influenced by their parents or they have to go though you were asking people these questions for me audience in mind always just a formula for my information if I was thinking also to have some sort of reports about peace agreement in Northern Ireland and how it will be\nEducated in our country\nI think if someone goes there the fall or they were in the middle of the city\nIt was the why did nobody could cross one side and that and now they are living in a peaceful life enjoying it in a while it's not it could give it a good example and I would hope one day and I want to start unfortunately\nUh in young generation they are following the steps of those who fought for nothing\nAnd pause for two years getting pictures\nAre coming out of of honest on state of civil and caved anyone who is scheduled for us they are humans so continuation of war is not in the benefit of anyone in this route to the allies in Northern Ireland do we cannot compare the\nAnd because of all their stock conflict is a little bit of complex but still when peace talk it is a good example\nI mean did you find that they experienced ... years of conflict which wasn't resolved to military means in the end it is a good message Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland and those who with the armed groups had political leagues and those political wings became political parties to say do you think that's something that Afghanistan could lead from an achieve\nThis should have learned it they should learn it and we have for example if you take the case of Taliban but one has a political affairs and author so they should be given if you want peace they should be given as a political wing\nThat taught him on but it takes compromise yeah if you want peace you'd have to compromise what did you find in Northern Ireland put signs of compromise would you say you found this name of Lyndon daddy some people are calling daddy somewhat or not they will not taking it serious\nLondon dairy being the name that the union is coated and dairy being the name that the Republicans would call it if you looked into the history\nThere were two main groups Eunice who wanted to be part of the Britain and there was a nationalist who are mentally capital X they wanted to join the republic of violent\nThe compromise you are for example the city officially is Lyndon daily but here port is called ... so it is a compromise doesn't museum that about the troubles in capital city\nDid you visited yeah when I was told and cricket there were some ... days so I visited the museum and they presented the history of the whole problem from\nAn sixteen hundred on word\nIt was very good and you call that a rich day this was at its therefore cricket players and I didn't have to go to anything that I have also brought a lot of interviews of cricket players who are now the stars one of them is that our ... you know if you follow cricket\nHe's a talk spend ball at in a T twenty cricket what did they make Northern Ireland because so many of them this was that first visit to the country to yeah one of ... uh he was complaining about the ... or ... what did he went he went to ... see us like this spicy food Indian cuisine yet and why did look at it out\nBut I couldn't find ... ... what about the weather\nOver there was surprising because I was similar with the litter of London but they're entering between lane and son is very short I was speaking with a

a new ways green credentials\nKerry and his ... well I Do\nBelieve that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWas a very as political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of can't Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars electrical and that's a ... a a major league towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a\nA big country bitter into the field to credits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us money to do all the research\nOn how old is a green technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think the because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better global and would you be job abroad or we will be job inside nowhere and doctors because we have the money for more than gossip to do the job\nWe do a lot of things in the rain forest ... we do look with ... electric cars you know where there's a good thing\nAnd say food looks safe from all the panels will be green credentials there Chris office in ... are you going to agree\nAgree with it topples they have with a domestic strategies and spending a lot of money abroad for the rain forest but I think the paradox it's worth getting back to here because we don't really have a plan of this ... or a strategy for how the transition will take place\nTake it out candy from the ground and where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing fulfill funeral in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo its withheld our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it in places like the parents see in the up to I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about here because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate ... well\nI think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounds based on cold in the work but I don't know oh you know we're talking about oh yeah but my point is that if you have\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Chris offices in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the old sinuses that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next cents in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because\nThey are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good sunny south\nWould look at the time frame because ... says well it could be doing until twenty seven to ... yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge drop ...\nOn on how you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know where he smoked and we've been debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how ... states being built how fast new investments are being made into\nRenewable energy and it's so many different types that renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell they thought is\nHow ... does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in Norway but it's become easy I've I've been working environment fallacious for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify yourself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about\nWhether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can Goodman says\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you have to buy do so well uh you get that perhaps\nIf you're a lucky from a organic waste and it's part of the circle that or if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called at three new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nAt the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the algae is from the burned see is like ... and the wages they stack them up on the other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we are\nKerry who wants to connect with she's yes it's definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... let's just explain what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take it called for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting government system quite all of a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the south has been focused on in our life for Twenty years I think that also I needed to challenge the politicians have with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas then how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to let us know what you think the program or if you have any ideas the topics

I think he would rather study of renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually developed an you we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and say well no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy

sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nNow they're concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and you will and that will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exploiting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually dot pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president's there because it makes them independent from Russian gas and all the gas\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the ... comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old no don't do to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that Norwegian energies plane as some people might not reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the air and sea have drilled about twice as much U.S Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's\n... for better conditions for gas because you have this problem and Europe that gas and ... are competing so it's not a black and what picture\n... that'd according to the carbon projects on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally ... the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe guess we'll exclude cold we've just like what you mean by the call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nUm there's a market inside Europe um the person being ... officially low for ... lot of years and that was made possible ... coupons in Europe too low cost for one those prices starting to rise then you got ... will push out cold enough ... renewables\n... and ... tend to stand that renewable and guess are competing in Germany they are afraid to be able to corporate pressing no but also the way the energy system works and ... and there's ... much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity that ... know gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count ... take Russia ... place when it comes to to guess and and ... guess but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent and are investing and renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exploding gas to Europe for quite some time ... ah we already made those commitments but\nThat does this about what kind of view do we have for Europe ... the states and Europe committed to have\nSyrup ... greenhouse gas emissions in their energy sector after twenty fifth they said that the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's very poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes very wealthy country a country that many people ... the the way which treats citizens ... the fact that it gets involved and international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... this country that's going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of the state ... new way\n... afraid ... some some level that it it might become that pull relation once again ... you\nKnow you you you painting ... far too short picture because ... was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry when ... power on maritime shipping so we may develop a state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has ... only plays in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because ... always has easy accessible ... so we built the welfare state ... early on we had a lot of food\nGoing on and thank God we didn't have the ability ... we we have a terrier since I've\nBeen looking at a lot at the whole history and one important objective ... supposed to keep them ... moderate pays for the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sucked in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost double the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became ... independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to type ... oil we should\n... ... but I guess I think\nWay to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because that means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a well for a state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ...\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directly itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system and for the site itself it wouldn't have anything to do\nOf them of course we will lose your income but it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world they have to increase coal emissions because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points are now so I'm back to that [laughter]", "show_name": "BBC
