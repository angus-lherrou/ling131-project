precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or how to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWas that language is from other countries filtering back in the game design\nIn their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not if it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on a cover you just won't do it in Germany so if you think of the culture you have to think of the language if you think of how people played\nSo at least not kind of postal German ... combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cost\nCalled German games in the nineties and then you're all games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of aversion to direct conflict they had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else and send you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in the place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I've been taking anything from you know I just prevented you from getting some

also ... within the scope vision loss community of\nWorldwide Muslims [noise] still extraordinarily unusual thing to be but they're just I just wonder where the for you it is due to just practice which most important all the social activism that goes with it\nIt's both actually the worshipping I've got it is only ten percent of the words that we do in the mosque because we have the friday prayer but besides that Ninety percent of our work it's centered around human rights work\nRecently I have developed together with the group of activists in Denmark nine thesis of Muslim reform based on his lab mix principles of justice\nAnd these nine thesis are of course women's right to serve as female moms today it is still too many Muslims something very rare and and strange and before we started the mosque two years ago in Denmark\nThe majority of Muslims in Denmark didn't even know that scene in moms was a possibility and why it's because we have normalized these patriarchal structures within religious institutions for decades\nSo you see is your job in the ... to ... feminist version over his long run\nI Do believe that we all should be feminist feminism is about giving men and women equal opportunities so to me that's the fundamental everything I Do believe that I'm In my in laws we are fighting to a challenge these patriot those structures\nAnd new generation of Muslims in Denmark and abroad who have some acute needs when it comes to and Islam and and how to practice Islam and the twenty first\nCentury who you're talking about radical change within your face and we had systems new situations you can't achieve though frankly by softly softly messaging on still wants to be friends with the sound is you're gonna have to I don't want to do\nNot want to be friends with the Saudis I was talking about the conservatives or the tradition in this because the majority of Muslims and then like our tradition and it's all conservatives and\nDid you do you agree with this is a really interesting words that came from a President Obama's former State Department envoy to me when communities around the world and a few of them as a therapist to eat\nAnd she said this is the end of the posting off to you know considering what you eat in the Muslim world she said\nOf sound influenced she said it's pernicious and universal in each place when I visited the hobby influence insidious presents the U.S must stole the show us must disrupt the training of extremists in moms do should be concerned about the way in which the Saudi money I assume we actually do share\nThat concern a lot and this is why I have a ... as her and that's it we want to create alternatives what to disseminate new narrative on his arm in Europe and abroad and we're not only talking this is about creating change on the ground\nAnd if we look at the ... at the changes that we have made so far let me give you an example then assess a T of interfaith marriages today\nMuscle and they cannot marry outside their faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural Muslim or you do not\nReally practice is on so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married and then my mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\nRereading the Koran and with a focus on gender equality allowing women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they've changed the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been a possibility for the man because it's stated clearly in the Koran that a Muslim men can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nBut the the other said it's not stay the candy but he does not stated either that a woman conned so we use that as our tendency\nBut you go to another problem there are many people in Denmark a politicians of the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and all of which forms to look at you and feel that you represent a danger because you you appear to make\nIslam more acceptable to a Danish minds when in fact they say many of your core huge on just the sort of aliens to Danish values as the so called Islam is\nIt's a very little minority or having that we're getting that\nWill go through a few of the specific points about you you claimed at the beginning of the money more experimental the founding of the most you said you were going to have mixed friday prayers\nDo a mixed ... lead was true but I didn't I didn't back up\nWhen you create a community people come and then join us that the policy democracy so the majority they voted for women's mosque on friday because they want to to\nTo establish a magical sphere with women only when women could say what they want and express themselves\nAnd in the beginning I was really I was really sad about him back home flooded I didn't back off I accept and that's the power democracy you have to think that the majority was good to know when you have to uh I have to make the constitution and because of confusion is vital when you want to create\nChange you have to understand the art of flourishing if you burn all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder\nThere's no I I really ... that\nBecause we have a women's mouth only on friday at all other days it's for men we have men coming from different countries to pray because we are centered in the middle of Copenhagen as the only mosque\nVary but in my life when my point was that if he wants to create change you have to do it slowly and ... and we can do the real revolutions by the interfaith marriages given women the right to divorce we can do these things because we are actually unsafe theological problem because nobody can criticize that if\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way I look at it your philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never bone you'll bridges ... by that way you achieve change\nWhat I'm hearing from years but it is a very delicate insensitive balancing act let's just take one more example I think a number of things you a quote unquote your political opponents on the run\nTo the dog your stunned after that a crisis over the cartoon in a unit was posted in two thousand and five I think there was a slave it first came out with\nThe cartoon became a sort of litmus test in Denmark for whether you are supportive of free speech that Tehran supple opinion whether in the case of many Muslims in the country you should that be a friendship and this is talk tuned to you from old age now it seemed\nTo me that was that that some of the um what ... that's ... that's not my quotation oh no no no\nCountry but this is your quotation uses\nFreedom of expression in your view must be used more delicately should win is the dialogue the bulk of the cartoonist in this case is claiming to still be sued to many things you do you actually are defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the call to\nNot on the other hand I with new on saying the debate\nI said that we have to understand that we're living in a globalized world and if you're living in a globalized world you have to ask yourself what tell you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and units talking they said that they wanted a dialogue with Muslims and on my so if you really truly wishes a dialogue\nYou have to understand you have to ask the essential question what is important to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many Muslims in the world so we ... we have a group of friends who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA values who are essential to them at the same time so it's not a matter of favoring the secretary of the Koran over freedom of speech it's a matter of understanding that if you want to enter the dialogue you'll have to have the stunt that people they have different principles of what a valuable at the same time\nWell is that the ... you are trying to find a very fine line to conduct your work and you say yeah but you've written a book and it's all about how you want to see a\nSort of a feminist take within Islam and I understand a lot but you say at the end in a very searing the onus passage at the end the use of this comes at a priceless is not easy\nAnd we have to pay a price if we really wanted to fight for our principles and values and you paid\nA very personal price which you reveal at the end of the book yes it cost you your marriage yes to a man who you you kind of ... is a good man but he was of Pakistani Danish origin his view of his religion was different from yours\nHe felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage wasn't worth it\nYes it was worth it because I think that that's how many people they want the recognition they support the show and then what changes\nBut they just don't want that don't talk all that wife to be ahead of the right of the show and somebody has to be a head of the ocean so to me it was not a matter of choice I'd ever make a choice\nBecause I place myself a head of the revolution and\nIt's impossible to withdraw when you just started it\nBut that has a cost that goes beyond you your husband the coolest your children your wind a family that must be something that weighs heavy of course it does of course it does\nWhen you're at peace with the decisions you have taken the fight you are fighting\nI let my children are very proud of what I'm doing and I have\nFamily who who support this so I'm a peace treaty ...\nFascinating and thank you very much for joining on hold things shift\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

more traditional ranchers could get involved in the business and that their supply chains and expertise could be used and they could completely redefined how may work do you think that for ...\nYou know that's an interesting perspective because when we hear these companies talking about their products there are statements on the record saying we intend to completely replace animal agriculture a so\nFrankly I don't see a way that these producers can work with these companies I'm not to mention\nThe that are actively managed grazing benefits the environment to this is something that is not
