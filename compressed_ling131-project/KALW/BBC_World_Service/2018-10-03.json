across town the mayor's office with distributing these food basket\nRight so and so people are buying well politicians local politicians are effectively buying votes I guess because they control the mayor's office and in Brazil controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nRight they've got all these savers going on and actually outright the buying as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or twenty five dollars\nAnd then what happens is the mayor of this town basically tries to get all of the people living in this town to vote for the politicians that

this national election though isn't it\nHas indeed and whoever is elected president is going to have a really tough time getting rid of corruption because there's a whole system that breed that and that starts in these little towns and then works its way up some of the things you need to\nUnderstand about Brazil is Brazil has massive electoral districts so everyone in El ago as\nAre voting for the same legislators and in this case there's four hundred and forty different candidates that they're going to have to choose between for various positions and that kind of huge array of candidates combined with thirty five political parties\nMeans that elections are really expensive so there's a need for money in some cases from legitimate places and in other cases as the corruption
