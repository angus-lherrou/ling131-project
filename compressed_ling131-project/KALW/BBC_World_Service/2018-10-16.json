different what made you decide to find a new lawsuit against you form a both in twenty sixteen\nShowing two thousand six fingers said three I was with ... from very high profile producer in Georgia\nSo he was making sexual advances toward you yeah favors yeah sexual favors could you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you you know working within that environment\nSo Georgia societies like struggling with all the gender inequality and sexual misconduct and feminist side at fantasize that swing women and girls are killed by men yeah so sexism in every environment is not a big deal\nSo she's tough person she's like ferry or sexiest\nHe was always like commenting goals is sexual comments\nFor me before realizing that this was very unfair\nAnd I'm a Taurus quite normal I was just like ignoring ... comments and trying to just do my job because you know we all need to our job and we don't want to last job because this about economic a struggle we have in Georgia\nSo what made you then still picking the warring these comments and then decided to actually make a recording of him because this\nIs because he was asking for thank him I said towards not comments anymore she was asking for sexual favors from me regarding guy was striking to lost my job so\nThey saw such kind of formulation and they're supposed to return so unfair that type just couldn't it's being a silence and doing nothing so of course I denied it and I went to court civil rights cards\nSo he said if you didn't give him the sexual favors he free to do with the most of your job yeah and as I understand it the new news against sexual harassment in Georgia so how did you go about bringing this case the court\nYeah there's no particular like isolation against sexual misconduct ... job but we have this on to discriminate law where we have this part of sexual misconduct toward women\nSo with cooperation calling Joe's we was ice case also my case was before me to campaign and that's for me to campaign each was kind of why I think and car is very sensitive institution\nSo I could manage to was okay\nBut such a a considering that they were new

conversation and today we were to women who've spoken out about alleged sexual abuse in Georgia and then Japan both of them now campaign on behalf of women's rights\nI think more broadly about sexual violence in Japan and in Georgia how big stigma is it to be a victim of sexual violence in Japan jewelry\nThere is very strong state I'm I'm against rape victim here in Japan and even talking about sex is quite to boo but the thing is if you go out to sit in Tokyo\nIf you go to convenience store let's say you see these magazines ways woman and bikini or naked women and I feel like there are many symbols and pictures and\nWhat you will see a woman being sexually objected but yet talking about sex isn't very open and hearing Japan\nAnd in a traditional media like newspaper especially it wasn't come on to talk about or said that word or put the word of right\nIn the newspaper so they often use the word such as violated or if the victim is under aged than they will say they were tricked\nSo it it's Olson covered was different words and it's just really hard to know what is actually going on\nTo enjoy what you what is the situation there when it comes to sexual violence and the stigma around it\nYeah also in Georgia we have a church teaching them about rape and sexual violence\nBunch sturgeon government to snow during something because we have very high statistics of feminist side in Georgia we have very ... system it's kind of very macho\nOpenly sexual rights of women here in Georgia stigma is who was a stigmatized there's a very loud woman which is not good label to carry\nRight but what part of the personal consequences of speaking out to be labeled as a very loud women what else did people say about you once you sort of speaking out\nLike it was my fault\nOr even worse that's it's normal because I'm like a girl and she just asked so what's the big deal with that do by the crowd's like quite tend to tend toward towards the problem they said they saw us kind of sexual scandal\nAnd not civil rights case right and I I went through bowling on the Internet and so it was tough time for me\nShe or he can you relate to any of what you're saying about what she went through when she spoke out yeah\nI had quite strong backlash after I spoke up and\nStill today I'm On line and there were many names that I was called out such as ...\nWhat is the honey

the whole country has changed because\nThere are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our

old man of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to tell the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house seats here as a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting\nOver the next two years\nSeems to me that if done baking the Republican nominee winds here\nThat will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female rural or\nUrban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately to the right\nHere with the race at all as I Am\nOn the doorstep counter Eastman seems to be winning hearts mind ... votes but would it be enough the victory when the broadly conservative state like Nebraska spend the progressive punk fan to Washington the question for the suppose says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement based on current political standings and maybe I should say I hope

congressional race is shaping up to be the most expensive one this swing district has ever seen\nAnd at the moment she says the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman even\nRaise one point five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had the four and she got a lot of money from individuals as opposed to clean\nAll across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head in the progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district does as we heard there from the former math become this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYes so the um progressing groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the

elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about mid some elections which don't generally get used to an outside and that's going to be a teacher that so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up on they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and be heard and she's doing a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the vote\nAnd you don't see many I've had a dumb bacon is
