them be better off\nFor more than that to come later but let's begin in Italy and the potential showdown with the European Commission\nToday's Italy at today its ally published it proposed national budget just fairly routine occurrence but as the third biggest economy in the euro zone which is already in considerable debt it's important\nTo take an ally as the populist coalition government wants to boost public spending which could punt ... into yet more debt\nYou rise and moves mean Brussels could reject the budget and demand visions the European Commission is due to respond on Tuesday or less at a time that economists warning that an economic crisis in Italy could seriously damaged economic health of the whole of Europe and perhaps beyond\nSpeaking to the press today the Italian prime minister set they come to say that it's any needed to raise the debt to sit in order to stimulate the economy but he said there was no chance it's and he would leave the EU or the European single currency the euro right\nWhen I leave [noise]\nForty there is no shame no way to get to tell a ... there's no way to get out the viewer all of those\n[noise] but in a moment we'll get the view of a member of the governing coalition says why should the state's ... economy worry the rest of the world yeah cup cook a God is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics think tank in Washington DC\nYou have a country in its ally which has a very large existing debt and doesn't because of structural features like an aging population et cetera have prospects for growing very fast in the future\nA country like that or if it's suddenly stopped running significantly larger deficits than had previously been agreed\nIt is a warning signal and that is why the European authorities right now are taking a very close look indeed at these new Italian budget proposals because they are actually\nMaking it clear that this government wants to run a deficit that's about one and a half a percentage point larger than the previous government\nSo let's put some pressure on the buttons of this and what makes it ... the economy in particular so vulnerable to that because some saying this could be the next flash points for the next global economic crisis\nSome of these are the signs it's a little bit like what we saw a earlier in the euro crisis if you get to the point where investors are no longer willing to buy any Italian debt that they basically\nBelieved that the Italian government finances are unsustainable well then you have a full blown crisis in the euro area once again because at that point in time either the euro area or more likely the European Central bank would have to intervene\n\n[noise] this is Rebecca it can be with news out lights from the

future of our families who wants to leave the crime in Honduras were risking pool to do that\nIt's a big sacrifice but we really have no choice and he also on the air [noise]\nWhat is striking look

correspondence and Lima bull which that Margaret ... in Mexican\nSo let's pick up on that point to President Trump's threat to cut aid to Central American countries that failed to stop the my income going his administration has already veggies funding to those countries now to put us is with the into America dial group which is a think tank and she explained the current situation\nTwenty Seventeen to twenty eight team that's funding has already been caught\nSubstantially for example in this specific case of a door as is it dropped from Ninety five to sixty seven million the other thing is that this funding is usually focused on attacking them what do we know are the root causes of this big migration pushes a basically violence and lack of economic opportunities\nOf the support or this cooperation from the U. S. I usually those Stuart security initiative on the other half towards various economic development and social development project so it is kind of counterintuitive to try to caught you know\nSo you know saying that if those governments receive age in the United states there's no reason for people to prosper and their own country\nThat is actually what has been happening the cooperation from the United states to this country have more and more fuckers precisely in this type of initiative that try to strengthen the countries\nAre it's not like now it's got to happen like and and some of this project's actually show advancement in this topics specifically so yes these are the things that we know that have worked and that starts as I mean this is a long process\nBut that are starting to work and caught in it or does not help but\nSaid President Trump's supporters would say that that aid has been wasted because it hasn't gotten rid of the problem corruption still rice across ... countries\nThe power of the criminal gangs is gripping city centers and towns around the whole region and this age issue as both of them as pets and the more you give them all the countries need where does it end\nFirst of all I think that the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem\nThat is very long time and a very short term it's very complicated we're talking about countries that\nThere is that well we're at war the democracies are starting even if you and I'm not saying that I agree with it but there's a lot of people that actually could responsibility of the current
