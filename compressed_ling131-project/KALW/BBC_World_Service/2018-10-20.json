conditions are better way to describe in the book which are owed leave\nBut besides that the characters all the characters are fiction and the the how to book moves such\nAs a point during the book and you referred to there several times the theme of side and so the imposition of silence on people what are you getting at when you focus on that specifically\nNo actually actually silence is part of or one of the big thrown my experience is that the the victims are tied it there are side by the drum\nThan they are silenced\nBy city because the Palestinian story was never hurt because there was another story which was covering it\nAnd for the world which means Europe the other story was bigger because it was beautiful made that story that is the the articles was done by Europeans and so the whole book is a dialogue with sinus how you can make sightings speak how we would take\nThe fragments of words you know the mother of of of and I'm used to speak in in fragments and fragments of words and hit the could lift demeaning from the fragments of her silence\nAnd the whole book is is it is I mean it does is is that are good with the silence this ... of understanding silence and the making from silence\nLet's say a meaning for position and also the third thing about science is you know you know\nWhen is it a goes gated the Jews of your of where we're not very well respected because they

it's the same situation I must be about the the the numbers but the situation where victims find themselves is very similar ... orders\nWhat reception has the book had an Israel\nThe book came out in Israel for months ago in Hebrew and the first edition was out of print in two weeks you know TV something very many important is that even with the dominance of this ...\nAdmission industry could reduce our daughters you into the students there are people who are my other my mentor try see myself in in the\nLebanese Russia LA is really fun to go to I mean you know for the program left that notion of silence really much to chime with what he was saying but\nI mean I think one of the things that he's trying to do it as he says he's trying to give voice to the victims that are written out of history and I think that that uh the world over the world after and I think that in some ways retelling stories such that the victims of the Holocaust are not meant to be cowards are making out the Palestinians\nWho ended up being expelled or remained or do we tell their story in ways that allows for them to be incorporated re incorporated into the stories we tell about our past it's been something that actually I'd ask what has been doing since the Nineteen seventies I had my almost every novel that he's written has been concerned but the questions is\nHow what the place through these people ... taken history and he's long although he himself has not been easy has long been concerned with the question of Palestine and many of his novels or about Palestinians\nAnd the motivated the story a code even more impact it has obviously absolutely\nI think I'm In ... narratives um which is what stories are incredibly are important and in fact we\nSee every day we engage in the battle of narratives and when we forget and the problem is all was that um the nationalist or the right wing as a for a long time have been much better in telling a story\nThan um liberals 'em and certainly in the past twenty five years was sort of ... how to tell the story that narrative which ah was very powerful and that's what won a actually a much more than anything else than the military or the

Canada\nCanada goose if any of the second country off to Europe why to to legalize cannabis legalize why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view\nThat Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on so they said look we're going to try and bring in this new\nStrict control regulation framework in debt and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective system one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and would reduce\nSome of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then well just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form\nAnd you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork ... same someplace and you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous province you can use it a sense the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes you chew tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there actually some new infractions\nAround selling to minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older not everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health\nA society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus\nSo again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions now we're hearing a lot about of green rush up all the possible\nBoon to the economy that this device\nThe months up to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested\nIn joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency crunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on Cabot\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea and of course because Canada is doing this and it said it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely ... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana and we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries are looking at decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward\nAnd if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nThat was Jessica Buffy in Canada and that's it from the will this week from now if you had any thoughts on what we've done well what you'd like to do these contact us on BBC will service on Facebook or Twitter and don't forget to join us at the same time next week for a look back at what happened in the next seven days\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which is the problem was used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I'm often what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people who don't have those other ways of communicating with each other or so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore up a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve the farmer or ... disease so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture and just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that your technology is very simple technology it's SMS does does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty car church it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple format\nOr so when a former U.S with a question for example on on a semester we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is they're entitled to question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nI get up his book content back to the original farmer\nNow you've you've got to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member\nWhoa what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\nYeah so it would pass a million which is as I was so great milestone for us heading to one point two million I'm I mean I think the first in biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched\nUm so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month\nOr which you know it in context as is probably nearer to seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find isn't necessarily a fun system to yours is not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business\nWould say uh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they are using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's helping save or their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example I\nI Would give is that there's a chicken farmer that I was using we farm in Kenya called called castle he kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a disease was ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space with a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farming get information back a which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading I managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire lively it and that's that's the kind of light so\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from ... from a Mona El Salvador from ... in a special guest uh\nUh that wasn't one of those red now public a positive stories about social media or five years is a guy and one of those social media was going to save the world that was it was a positive uses we've all that changed totally\nYes to Santa and live in ... the year we celebrate in social media we thought it's getting to the world it enables people and other retail regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activist real people are very very few\nPeople didn't practical things like that yeah ...\nExactly will use social can paint three simple over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now battles between two ... that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now are talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but of course the perfect and that gets to highlight all that time\nA commercially it's still very important um I ... connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we are getting more good than bad from it\nWe're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have failed because we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe we'd done no\nOne very brief would use every climbing or you still positive about social media [laughter]\nI think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat we've got time for anything on the positive effects of my special guest Mona El ... from the ...

I went to a society where the moon to racial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably about ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy a roll call um I I never met\nAll my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the fame him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't politics until I kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleventh for you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics\nIs that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an orderly social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that\nWe are generally much more anxious about socializing with people who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity\nAnd ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is a someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not egg laying around ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful\nAsia it's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together somehow to differences defined as more than the country of course they're real differences out to be celebrated but they also the coming out and she says how are we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political\nContest enough even those notions of citizenship and the moms yeah of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm but at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's the way that's what you said on\nSaturday on strike and I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population\nBut as black so I think actually this conversation would be a more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with ...

I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a side of the history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots we left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nAnd not only affects our own hands on all the things that he's saying that you love found that it isn't that are going to told what's wrong\nPeople of identity politics but I'm saying that your national fuzzy and Livio poster nationalism I imagine you are and you you're on your um your your national thing making my country but for the majority\nIn some of the majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that has served the stuff that's in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous obese\nWhat is the writer response would be to ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respect if\nWe're not going to eat that he is not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of national lives in the Congress talking didn't have ... elements to it the one\nAnd that would do out of areas of angry as well as looked at what age and if if I can bring you back then in a sense there there is\nA we we do seem to be making a distinction between bigger identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets well\nBecause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more of rocks and that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan and they all spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel I have a little ... as a possible\nBut that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the chances that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively and peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly do and\nThe people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fired for the cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole members account division which says let's uh celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common\n... that's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a\nSub nationalism that his English nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down there's a correlation between what you would call ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again\nI don't think we can have a lot of those things ranks that singled out and didn't have a ...\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people did vote for breakfast I I personally am not expecting it ... red majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nOf walked an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive nation is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of ... in the Brexit vote and secondly won the record\nWell continues job from the BBC ...
