to tell a little bit about why you started\nIs because in China there are no a publicity about anti sexual harassment whatsoever so uh we're gonna to uh do across funding to abide and that but because of the censorship we can all do that\nAnd so I use my body as a media to promote a and sexual harassment contact\nExplain exactly what you mean by that ... usual buddies and media distrust

discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what after all sexual swans and that's part of the reasons why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical\nAbout a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white um outcome goal and sort of dramatic last week and a half no spot is um I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan\nAnd I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right was saying who has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible\nIf you're me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one because I went to society with more interracial match with us more contact between\nCultures rather than we would have to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on your picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like the kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression\nAnd structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleventh for you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue of algae B. T. rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an artery social level not necessarily just on special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you were to party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nYou might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow to differences defined as more than the conduct of close to a real difference dissolved and that should be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out Jesus I read we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring them into the Democratic political\nContest enough even those notions of citizenship and the mom she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus then they shouldn't be warm but at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's I think ...\n... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo let me give you a couple of examples of plus what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement in Monmouth has actually contributed significantly to an understanding\nAs one of them in the back I've met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population\nBut as black so I think actually this conversation would be a more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually they white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in monoculture religious monolingual states this is no send you a situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some feet and along the function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized nothing the problem with the sensor them to use its by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier ...\nWell it's not to disagree with the premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a ... ethnic markets will self conception of themselves and thank God we stopped at the challenge that we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that that is something you talked to quite new\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth and one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by is minority than black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called\nIdentity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't cattle UK or tweet me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots you love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo play on the other hand over all the things that he's saying that you love found that it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to tell what's wrong and loving your country and its people\nAccuse people of identity politics but I'm saying your national zoom of your poster nationalism I imagine you are and you do your as your your national hold your thing making my country\nBut for the majority\nIn some of the majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that has served to step in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous obese\nWhat is the writer response would be the ... end up for it is the author nationalism over Congress party but sad but we're all Indians and respect of\nMe that he is not true and it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress party didn't have ... elements to it the one\nThat we do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what age it if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is\nA we we do seem to be making a distinction between bigger identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good thing\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more of rocks and that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village all with the city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan isn't that you also spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the ... I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nThat that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly do and\nThe people like ... like Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fired for cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest is ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's uh celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective looming above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nThat's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that next to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on that\nWay the Brexit vote broke down there a correlation between what you would call ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again either you know I don't think we can have a lot of those things ranks that singled out into the ...\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people ... did vote for that I I personally am not expecting it by majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nOf walked an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive nation is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of ... in the Brexit vote and secondly one but recognizes that the international sphere can be when when", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
