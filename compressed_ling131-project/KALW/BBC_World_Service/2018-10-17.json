he's probably expecting you to fold a let's talk about the issue in white is such a big stumbling block ... bomb out as a senior research fellow\nOf the nonpartisan research group UK changing Europe she is professor of a new law so very well qualified at Cambridge University here's a guide to why the Irish border issue is such a sticking point\nThere is a binary choice and that says you have a hard border in Northern Ireland but that means that the u._k. is out to the customs union and can negotiate the free trade deals full we have no ... in ... between the no fly zones in the south\nUm but that means they stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts that it's actually a shift in political position\nAnd that's the problem and the moment to reason they has that she knew Rico room on any shift in position and that ... they used to\nAnd if there is no deal done by the time to not that much we will leave with no deal which most commentators believe will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me a note grades either for the you twenty seven particularly around [noise]\nCan I ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty ninth ... because of the moment we say the snowboarder\nWell actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the boat or the other you go to different tax systems there's different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong check points there on the horrible business though I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border um\nIt is that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem lots what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the boat and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nAnd by that means cameras all security post anything of that so the real concern as it becomes a target of terrorist interest\nWell you have to ... to pay any money to play the game went down to the game I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy which is about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so kudos weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously you know some people have super into the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted online there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\n[noise] so you find them Lucas is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these are ... to cheat basically so he's made these include ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been sending these modes to the game online\nAnd for upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yet because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's right that base accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says they're not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nAnd you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fuss for Fortnite ready to vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um [noise] uh this is a different game actually paranoid and bustle grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hacking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating in games\nAnd like many things he gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nWith retreating and all sorts of games um thank you I understand a bit mono a twenty two minutes possibly a about Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalized recreational marijuana full consumption on site you regard was pushed the person\nNewfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country to be moving across to great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first batch\nIt's a company called a calls canopy growth states actually whiter a large multinational company and ah they set up shop in St john's so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are\nAbout three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street by the candidate\nBut for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor and ah they brought in all the rules and regulations companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nTwenty two locations off in a in the country right now that in ... in the front of it right now they can sell it\nAnd they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government\nLargely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and treat got in first that if the big companies that already um\nHad already set down the heck with down roots than other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is it's quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities\nMillions of people some of them are Canadians of one of them for very long time and that when Justin Trudeau ran to be prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and uh\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidates and the what Canada is going to do because\nArab way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within states but\nCanada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bomb that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually\nWhether there is even enough marijuana that's\nThe one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect\nThat demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of suppliers are probably going to run out even within the first few days ago right\nIs it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in the smoke that in private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal yeah H in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting there was a a break Julie cue behind a queuing up for the legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\nNow it looks like the cash will start flowing into the massive Angus three dam project in the Democratic Republic of

an actually make some money\nSuddenly looks like at the English three hydroelectric projects has been delayed many many times but now deal who's been signed so last year deal sea government off two competing consults you to join forces company the bill the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ac yes and no\nAnd and it's being money being delayed and they had those\nSorts of Nichols I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank of froze the displacement of Seventy three million dollars of H cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said that country had taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big is this\n... it's a huge um I mean the idea for the youngest three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from can shocks and knew that in a fool's\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's go fix phases\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power\nNow that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China does the DR scene neater used that much well I\nIt doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal if he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where will they mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nA and it also means that the deal is he can be a big power exposed to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south South Africa ah which has actually already signed an

disappointed\nTake this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what is happening is the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of northern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawal agreement if\nYou like still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the ... you or\nMe as an Irish MBP or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAnd I sort of commitment

runs\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely in reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across\nNew York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe where you have maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up for it\nThe first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paolo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get

describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\nAre a bunch of vertigo arrow hair on business

galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after the common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong\nRight it's water water bound in super
