Fifteen\nAs being a lot of water under the bridge seems football but first hit the public airwaves Tobar Nineteen eighty eight and we thank all of you who have joined us or any part of this long journey\nToday we're going to tell you the story of how the show came to me in the first day and we do this with help from a friend about character role as we prepare Rosemary host a show about a buck casts about living life with Cory\nYou can find out more about it on our website afro popped up bargain\nRosemary recently sat down with the founders of broke bunker Sean bottle and Banning Eyre and we're going to sample some choice excerpt from their conversation but first\nHere's distract from the group that's open to our family first thing that\nHave seen them out like when\n\n\nYou're\nTalking about him I Know a little more in a\n\nTo dun\nDun dun dun\n\nDun dun dun\n\n\n\nDun\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom South Africa in the Nineteen names and he did by Congress music from that you need them out in Queens wonderful\n... and we are looking back to the origins of proper worldwide Rosemary prince their hosts the podcast show hearts spoke with Africa founder Sean domino and longtime producer Banning Eyre\nWell when I first got down there than I ask Shawn and banning wet and that can I follow the heart well\nIt goes way back for me because my mother used to use that expression and yeah we were raised in the sixties and my parents were pretty\nThey were pretty liberal and they they always sort of had that ethic of you should do what you love\nI always had this conflict all through my formative years if I loved the writing and I love music I realize that both of them were things that you had to dedicate yourself to entirely so it was always like which one do I love more and I never really was able to make that decision\nSo I Do both but it is exactly what it sounds like you do what polls you you don't think about\nYou know the practical or or economic implications to an extent you do but in the beginning I I was always driven by just going to places I wanted to go pursuing the things I wanted to playing the music I wanted to play writing things in some of them a lot of them didn't work\nBut you know I I still basically operated on that for instance\nI hadn't parents are very similar philosophy there was all about don't force your kids to do what you want them to do because the wind up resenting you and allow them to do or what they love to do and God Bless my parents that's what they\nAnd I can just trace nature I grew up right on the Potomac River and I was all up and down the river all the time as a kid canoeing swimming swing and binds insulin\nLitter on hiking in the big national parks out west that was my passion and he checking here there and everywhere but really it was music to kind of pulled it altogether for me is I'm\nI'm not a musician but studied music and I kind of\nI was aware of like some big aesthetic principles that guided\nJob unease Indian African music and so on so I started doing a radio which is a passion for me it up in Alaska\nWhere I worked as a commercial fisherman and a cold storage worker and then and travel I Love to travel that was a big passionate and I think\nI tell all insurance who come here whatever you do take time off from school and go traveling you know I live in Morocco you know spend time in the Egyptian monastery whatever you know like you know become a an assistant to a game\nWhere in Tanzania you know that's the stuff you really learn from so is\nThere anyone who inspired you and you're a kid who you looked up to\nWould start with my mother she inspired me a lot artistically well first of all she played guitar and sang songs and when she was in college you know in their thirties or forties she traveled through Mexico collecting folk song and she always had this idea of found to music and that\nThat that was actually what started me playing guitar and she also made mobile she was a visual\nCreativity would just put the whole idea of being an artist and in my mind very clearly\nThere were many another one I Would point to would be a particular teacher that I had in high school whose name was Gilbert Burnett and he'd been in the ... which was the precursor of the CIA he taught anthropology and biology and he was just very studious very demanding\nTeacher but he was so incredibly open minded and there were so many ideas\nThat I was introduced to as a high school student that really stuck with me ever since just ideas in our culture and how culture makes people who they are deal with the first person who really really talked about in culture [noise]\nTo me and made me think about it as all the things that you acquire in life and from your surroundings as opposed to things that are just in bread and your genes or\nIn your blood and once that idea was in my head I've tended to think about things in those terms you know how much of your attitudes your capabilities your senses of what's possible\nEven your emotions and the things that draw you are really derived from\nCulture and you know when we started traveling in Africa that were just so many\nFascinating example of that I mean as a musician Iowa was note the way kids in Africa learn about and melody and rhythm especially ribbon because there's so much dancing and so much\n\nAnd it was this like cry from the heart that just like pure my\nHe was right of course those phenomenal this is the best in Africa and why it was just so little known in the world and that more than ten years after the rumbling jungle when the ...\nIt didn't happen so he was frustrated he was very frustrated and he and he wasn't speaking about me not knowing because obviously I was there and I was learning he was talking about me representing American citizen like\nA race to write it was really bad situation I'll I'll Try to do something about it\nI think something like that and it came through\nBut but anyway um and then the next time I went to Africa invited uh banning to come with me as a co producer and we also went to ... you can just named the names of the stars at that moment where their bet because a lot but when\nA four year old and media a taboo early I mean just so many other artists and unfortunately you know because we have recordings\nThat you can actually listen to the artist yeah there's a lot of them are dead but uh anyways uh there's always new artist kind got so so we really were on a roll at that point actually we're ... we had gotten funding from\nThe corporation for public broadcasting I came back from this Jeffrey let's say ... you could put together a little dirty part series and the big dog at CPB that and the radio program recommend\nRest in peace he said to me well on the kind of turn on\nThe panel listen to your demo tape and we think that Thirteen programs is not enough we want fifty two\nI oh I said well I'd have to go back several times to do the research to Africa doesn't do it\nJust you have an accountant no fun ones you have a computer no by what you know it's like you know basically gear up really quickly and yeah and then we're ... we're on we're new magic switch never happen today [laughter] yeah yeah so\nYou know and and in in retrospect you know this is in the wake of Graceland you know God Bless Paul Simon and then we're kind of have the right\nPlace at the right time and we had the right\nConcept you know and and and and of course mostly the music are so powerful a named unknown and that's the point of public broadcasting isn't it to introduce people to learn new things for their aesthetic enjoyment and for their spiritual consideration of them are\nUsing it you can join a man and you're leaving into consideration to that is what we're doing here from up worldwide\nI think back to excerpts from the ... to show off hard from an episode which\nPost Rosemary preparing for with Shawn Otto and Banning Eyre that's me George hey how are you I'm good I'm good at George I'm breaking foreign ... leaping out of the podcast dimension because I think\nListeners want to hear from you too about the birth of Africa ... we've dug into your back story and other programs I Know but today we'd really like to hear your version of how you came to host this program how does that happen\nWhile dining Nineteen eighty eight I had already been broadcasting for Thirty years had several radio shows on divorce America any French breakfast show Maxine Hong boom\nThe English evening programmed\nToned up sold et cetera et cetera well they weren't all that much say quite successful with audiences counting in millions I was presenting American music to\nAnd the world in general\nI played a lot of what they called ... music changed round within the get Jimmy Smith and all these amazing people who are unknown on international airwaves much\nGoing to a restaurant like African released by hand it was my listeners\nMade up of villagers winners high officials and ...\nAnd this music and also by the high powered DJ style that I\nOnly difference with the U.S radio drunks was my mentor\nPresenting life in America life in America what do you mean by that one I was presenting America to Africa but I also found that my new country the United states of America needed to know more about Africa land that has brought them the right to African\nAmerican musicians who managed to conquer the world with them and blues rock and roll blues and jazz but you also lived in Paris right where you worked with a lot of African musicians them right\nHere in the Nineteen seventies I was living in various where I was taking my radio shows on the voice of America industry that was set up an American embassy I don't know if the bachelor knew about it\nI was also work on various projects [noise] an African music goes that went bankrupt I'd contract with several record companies for example with Warner Brothers\nAnd I would get all these record companies to contemplate working with African musicians I knew them all I had become their country to the world my studio became the meeting place of Africa now she's in panic\nAnd that's when I made the decision that I Would present the enormously talented oddities when I went back to America and I wanted Americans to know them the idea was to produce a radio program presenting these beautiful African musicians to radio stations in the U.S [noise] but\nThe concentration to accomplish this project I was involved in the program working with ... writing songs\nThen one day a friend and the voice of America I told me that a radio producer was looking for somebody to present a program on African music on public radio radio what\nI was invited to go meet that person is innocent and that should you know was in the big brick warehouse in the from the neighborhood called New York avenue that\nWas a little nervous as\nHave worked in many studios but none like this this sound engineer open the many security locks prevent million and introduced to a tall lanky ... that can tackle ... and beyond a gentleman who has that the\nPublic radio demeanor has caught it\nDrove ... said the sound engineer and treating the French pronounce dish in the George meet Sean ...\nWho was hardly sliding said animals are I've heard a lot of good things about you as you heard I Need somebody to present this program that I intend to produce for NPR talk that's record a demo\nOh clouded that go without the recording is showing at the region except for the estimates that usually forget to pronounce just see would you not pronouns says in French all went mostly\nThanks to Shaun ... professional eastern and rubber\nAmen to sound engineer moves engineering I must say that to the sound of that deal was white amazing [noise]\nSo that's our long relationship started and like in our relationship everyone brings his gift to make it work Sean is fast manager and\nExcellent radio writer\nAnd me while I bring my knowledge of Africa and my aunt Suzy has them for presenting my continent to the world and maybe also life or something to do is he the signing back\nStory and your voice has a lot to do with it but thank you that's a really wonderful layers\nComing up tomorrow Sean and banning from the ... to show off hard and visit from bumps on our to our feature on the future I\nDon't miss it I ... and you're listening to prop worldwide from the ally public radio international\n[noise]\n[noise] ...\nNow let's get back to Rosemary's conversation with Sean and banning\nSomehow Africa hot has\nManaged to exist yes some for like around the area you're less yes that is amazing it is and maybe it is I was Thirty years ago right now that\nI made my first trip Sean second trip to uh Africa eighty so that other music show is there that's lasted that long I mean especially when the U.S out other cultures you know I I don't consider any other show really nothing like it yeah it's true so what you created was entirely unique yup\nIs remarkable because there's this sort of certain ... just out there and see where the kick your [noise]\nYour leg way high it's like how do you do that\nAnd you smash it then\nThey would know who they are like ... like during the splits but like bending forward with their like their trunks or whatever and then it down to the ground I guess like a war dads\nYeah is that I could actually about smashing the scale of your enemy ... that's a good way to finish off yeah they'll do that so Johnny ... bans mates\nWho as you say would go into townships where white and black bans were not suppose split with illegal illegal or that shows and you got arrested how many calories than many left\nI grew up listening to Johnny ... my family\nHip music was profoundly important information for me last October Sean banning and I went to see him perform at bb king of New York city\nThis is part of his could die tour with a deeply moving enjoying but emotional experience\nWell the thing is that John Johnny Was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\nCouple of years ago and he's now been through chemotherapy twice and basically is prospects are good but\nHe was in remission and so he decided to do a world tour farewell tour and kind of make your show the kind of summed up his life and you know I mean you've met so many artist so for years and sometimes they kind of remember you and they're friendly sometimes they don't remember you at all\nBut Johnny has always been really president you know he remembers right back to that first time we man and he's given us in just really spectacular very deep interviews over the years or so in this case he was singing one of the songs that he often ends to show it\nDaylight which is really a beautiful song it's kind of a song about longing and it has this great line that I think I Know why the dog house at the moon and then he thinks this incredibly moving course everyone's singing along\nAnd then it has his refrain I burn for you and right when he hit it each spot and made the audience and he pointed right at me and then that iceberg are you yeah and I was like oh my God that was that was powerful yeah\nHow did that ... I was just really touched by it and then they tend shivers down my spine I mean it really it was beautiful\nWere stumbling on the ... hot [noise] and that's one point we asked about ... miles in Africa pops recent history when we won the two thousand the ... the body institutional award recognizing our entire buddy or for\nThe moment that you found out that you'd one what was that like oh the guy who was working here at the time as our director of the media sent back her I thought he was pulling my leg you know I couldn't believe that you know like what what do you tell me about like what what do you mean and\nAnd then then it became real it actually got on the phone with the director of the few buddies who confided to me that he was really kind of lobbying heavily for at least on\nWhen that news came through I was actually on a ship and pray are burning in Cape Verde and I had I have my job was to do lectures and to arrange for concerts and that was an artist who's there will be a singer who was supposed to come on the ship and perform and they hadn't showed up\nAnd it and it was late and those kind of becoming stressful so I went down on my laptop and opened it up to find the contact number for the person that I was supposed to be talking to and there was this email from Sean saying that we just wanted to the body\nAnd it was it was just it was a real I mean that was a wonderful day in the number of ways from that point on\nBut it was funny because the the director of veterans that there was a British woman and she had never heard of you know I didn't even really know what the body but you know I mentioned it to her she immediately got under a theater and it was funny thing was that\nThe other person who got him to show that was David Attenborough and then he was like God to her and it was like you are in the same way that you knew it was a funny day or more yeah it's real high\nBoom you know human beings have even been able to get into that but then they ... they gain by\n... being able to gain by\nThere and it has made a week as we look back on fifty years of afro pop [noise]\n\nA few years ago\nWe preach currents to come to the show on the route from Zimbabwe she was drawn in by the music but also by the instruments used in spiritual practice them here I used to connect people literally ... with the feeling of their ancestors\nThis is somebody you find all over the world you find it in sushi music and\nAt least you find it in a ... music Peru\nSo many places music is used as a way of you know ... talked about the journey of the ... kind of thing you're using the music to to actually transcend reality in the case of a Shona with your beer to they conceptualize it as bringing about\nPossession of an ancestor so that you can actually communicate with that ancestor and droughts\nResolve some situation or conflict that's another fascinating thing about a lot of African music is the way it forces you to re conceptualize the whole way that you think about music and\nCulture not just like the whole way you think about music culture on\nAncestry because the the purpose of the embarrassed to call on the ancestors and as a result all all of these people in Zimbabwe know who their ancestors are going way back um which I don't I don't know that about my you know like I Know a few decorations the facts\nHave that kind of connection to our ancestry\nRight right ... you know like on the air and you know it's not actually everyone it's about what you notice that because of the very harsh nature of the ... regime and its insistence on interfering with culture\nThat music remains stigmatized for a lot of involved with a lot of the urbanized send Bob ...\nHave this very ambivalent relationship with that kind of culture like it's it's something that you do when you go home to the village at Christmas but in the city you wouldn't want to be associated with this as a whole\nCultural divide but that thing about ancestry that's actually even more true in the other music I spend a lot of time with which is the Grio music of West Africa like Mali where again it's a very elaborate beautiful musical tradition and but the whole content of the lyrics in this case\nIt's not about possession or anything mystical but it is very specifically about recounting history and talking about ancestors had a good grief has to know\nThe stories of all the major family so they just stare at a wedding there is a person who's assigned to know each family the cubs is gay so the ... have just arrived so then the ... no weather\nAll the stories to tell and what how can I relate that to the present and there's this whole miracle improvisation aspect but as a result of that I was just so amazed when I Lived in Mali in the mid nineties that little kids just knew all this history you know and that's not\nIt's not true here but it's also not true and a lot of parts of Africa\nThink about the difference between us in our culture in school having to learn our history\nShut down our throats and then we can answer test question right compared to in certain African cultures where\nSomething that they learn from the culture yeah that's gonna that's going to stick with you know much more because it it has\nSo you know we spend a lot of time in Mali but you love love love love Molly\nAmazing artist a missing people managing stress but anyways um the resource it goes back to the thirteenth century you people the artist who are the keepers of the history\nThey can tell stories from the standing of the the empire ... that's pretty amazing band complain suggest a key to wherever he goes into Mali and contacts and that's that is the story that is the song of the jets and anybody can play that [noise]",
