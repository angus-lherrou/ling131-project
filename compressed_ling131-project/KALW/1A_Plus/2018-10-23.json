N. F. the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nIt's meant to prevent the u._s. or Russia from developing certain types of nuclear missiles but President Trump says the deal is passed its expiration date\nWhere no one said in there for him and we bonded agreement for Russia is not really going to terminate all out\nWhat has the INS treaty meant for national security and what would it mean for the U.S to end it\nCan aid Ullman was President Reagan's arms control director when this treaty was signed he's also a former U.S ambassador to the United nations and the author of Reagan at ... forty\nEight hours that ended the Cold War welcome back to want to thank you good pronunciation there drag racing event yeah now spell it I don't know what on paper right here I'll put it down and then just say I know how to sell Reykjavik I also know that some of you will have questions about the INS treaty not one of those treaties you hear a lot about will get the basics\nFor investor ate 'em and but we will be discussing this just for the first part of the program so we welcome your questions and thoughts about this right away email us one eight at W. A. M. U. dot org\nComments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one eh\nLet's start off with just the IMF treaty exactly can you explain a little more what it did what it does and and why was important ...\nYes first of all we don't use initials because they're confused as everybody right [laughter] but what it is is what President Reagan did with Mikhail Gorbachev the Soviet leader in Nineteen eighty six after they\nUh during and after the wreck of the summit was to have a treaty that limited in the higher class of nuclear weapons it was the first time that ever took place and what was most important about it was a two elements Joshua one is that the Soviet missile\nOr the ss twenty but the Soviet missile threatened all of our NATO allies okay it was the number one problem facing NATO and the west is when Reagan become ...\nIf President Carter before that but President Reagan really I've kept on the path and eliminated that threat to all NATO So that was an enormous enormous accomplishment the number one threat removed after five years\nSo it's just it's just kind of missile this intermediate range and the material\nIs not strategic which means real long real far\nIt's um was in a base in the Soviet Union and targeted Paris and London and Bonn Berlin and all of our NATO allies okay so that was one thing though is awfully important about a ... second thing is because you eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons\nWe started a decline in overall nuclear arsenals that has been stupendous\nSince ... right now today the Russia has about eighty percent less nuclear weapons than had at the time of Reykjavik eighty percent eighty percent less now anytime you move a social science indicator\nFive percent everybody says holy cow that's enormous but this is eighty percent lower than they had there were about um Seventy or Seventy five percent lower so to start to decline and nuclear weapons that has been astonishing and we couldn't even predicted or believe it in Nineteen eighty six\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine right is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty\nThose are good questions uh and uh it's unclear in the constitution what Congress's role would\nWas ratified or by the Senate ah and ah in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump presidents in Nineteen eighty seven a but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of a treaty that is the president's discretion in Congress has no role in that\nCan you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there's the threat from North Korea there's a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to ... closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces were this where does this set\nIt's just pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against a whole class of nuclear weapons okay\nTo me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear uh treaties and nuclear threats are that are bound by treaties is the nonproliferation treaty which really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons is bread\nAnd a buying large that's been pretty successful Joshua or the fact is in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy\nThere would be twenty five nuclear weapon states by Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six\nSeven and so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nAnd the ... the liberation of nuclear weapons was a disaster that did not and so and so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact that a treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know ... or a little tense right now\nRight it was and certainly the weekend in Reykjavik in October eleventh and twelfth Nineteen eighty six that I document in my book and thank you for mentioning it\nAh that will be turned into a movie fairly soon a is an exciting rollercoaster of up and down and emotions up as got up and down views in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produced the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy tug\nOf for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night\n'til six thirty the next morning\nGoing over the details of this and I could report to the president the next morning on that's October twelfth Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night than we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians it was just a whale every weekend\nBefore we move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if by way of wrapping up our conversation and I could ask you about the leaders who signed this treaty Ronald Reagan ... Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with mice Mr general secretary do my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise]\nMaximum is do vi no pro vi\nJeanie and that is you end up\nThe pattern every meeting [noise]\nFrom the meeting in Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and B how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua\nOr in the sense that um [noise]\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of the man the humbled and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with a Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or\nThis is probably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or whether they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really love the immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and it's a whole address was about immigration how wonderful life\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having terrorists at any time and he was very intense it's dry reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway this style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend are extra wide I'll work on it for a much a very good back [noise]\nTwo Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we studied them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following ... they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are of veered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership\nThere is no one formula no one checklist that defines all leaders\n... McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss it General McChrystal welcome to one day it's\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nI mentioned Robert de ... in part because his story kind of opens the book it frames the story in some ways you mentioned early on that you looked up to Robert ... as a leader you went to West Point Lee went to West Point and he's one of those kind of\nAlumni that had a major impact on the country for better or worse\nYou sitting on a Sunday Morning last year you throughway a painting of Robert elite that had been hanging in your office for forty years it was a gift from your wife that followed you through most of your career what was the last straw what made you get rid of that picture\nWell following the events that Charlottesville my wife asked me the question of how I thought others would perceive the painting when they came in the home\nAnd she made the point that although I may think about the normal leadership qualities of effective general she felt that in fact it might unconsciously send a message of white supremacy or other things that I don't associate myself with what\nWas it about generally before Charlottesville that you looked up to\nWhat if we look at Robert de Leon and he and I have a separate it by the time quite an association I tried to emulate many of the qualities that he uh demonstrated and\nAfter Charlottesville he had become a symbol that people even looked at the monuments\nBack now to our conversation with General Stanley McChrystal coauthor of the new book leaders myth and reality we asked you who you think of as a great leader and why here's what some of you left in our inbox\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush Bush forty one staunch Democrat personal hero and whom I think that leader I Know of\n... and one of the greatest leaders that we have an American leader that truly want people to live there live\nMy name is Rodney from Cincinnati, Ohio um some of my greatest leaders in my life ah where my basketball coaches um inner city coaches that had to deal with different personalities this is Harry from St Louis Missouri the leader that I look up to currently is Elizabeth Warren\nHi my name is Karen I live in Iowa and you Michigan\nMy greatest leaders example was my own father he ran for state representative in Nineteen sixty lost by a few votes was the mayor of our city for\nI grew up in a home where community service was the number one thing in our lives and he was a great leader because he stayed unbiased and\nGreat examples everybody thank you very very much for calling in and sharing your stories we still have more time for some more of your stories about where you find leadership in your own life or maybe there was someone you had considered a leader but you don't anymore what changed\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a act W. A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to lead but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThat they are retired from the military and I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then the short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better\nI think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent who pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military\nIn harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give along side to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our wheat demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them that we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and\nI thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star but when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that\nBut I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leaders still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on a leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nResults matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results that\nLeaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others\nIt it it is something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's probably a success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician in Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill she was extraordinarily powerful\nBut over time her art of power started to bend down and she became more autocratic\nPeople became less accepting of a very centralized way and when she fell she was essentially assassinated by some of our political allies she had left a bit of a vacuum because it had started to be about prime minister Thatcher\nIt's interesting one of the leaders that you profile in the book\nWho really did not leave a vacuum in a in his absence but rather really replicated himself was Abu Musab al Zarqawi the founder of the kind of the progenitor of what became the Islamic state when you were introduced the defense who are often credited as one of the people responsible for\nFor killing him I Wonder how we learn from people like ours our car we about leadership and whether those lessons could help us defeat terrorism\nWell I think we have to I fought against Zarqawi for more than two years before we killed him and I stood over his body\nSoon after a ... but on the other hand I Would say I have a grudging respect for Abu Musab al Zarqawi both as a leader and as someone who strongly believed in his cause I disagreed with his cause\nBut if you really look at what he did he lifted\nHe became ideologically fervent effort experience in Afghanistan as a young man he's at a very difficult upbringing than he spent five years in prison and during this five years in a Jordanian prison he learned that if he was ideologically pure and extraordinarily self
