W. A. M. U. dot org\nCertainly not we will not be ignore you at all this hour or at any time and we walk more of your stories and questions as well about dealing with these stories comments on our Facebook\nI Am you dot org we're speaking to Lawrence Taylor the founder and director of defend yourself and Harvard professor terrorists and Conan who studies sexual assault trauma before we bring in our next guest let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and the freedoms of dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it was thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but\nThere are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you are more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss is a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nOn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing\nStories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent got my own experience\nCan you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I had I had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and an interesting one other and\nWe drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time on and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly then I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I and ask them to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... frankly is probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible and they hit the camp this is the laughter so last the previous laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories ... perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does [noise]\nUm they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise] doctor for it and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her and\nThe human brain has specific parts that are involved too in code fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really\nLike to my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nBut forget other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThey've kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you describe that it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you were walking through on that house you'll forget all the decor was that thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but I'm a professor Conan will tell you the trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of ... um\nThis body so um we we do rural place of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\n... through a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me she asked me to show him my breasts while he stroked himself asked disgusting questions you did\nNot tell in my day my friend she left my friend she's not my friend and the longer\nWe're speaking tomorrow gay or the New York times editorial board Lawrence Taylor was the founder and director of defend yourself and Harvard professor terrorists in Paris and Conan Murray you said that one moment that stood out to you\nFrom last week's testimony has to do with professor Ford running into the person that she says witnessed the alleged assault I'd I'd like you to react to it as soon as we play a little piece\nMark judge has\nLooked like he was working there and a arranging the shopping cart [noise] and I said hello to him\nAnd his face was white [noise] and very uncomfortable saying hello back\nMara why did that stand out for you\nWell uh you know I actually ran into um the boy idea who raped me a several months ago in my favorite bar\nBack now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do because you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with us mortgage loved to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that comes\nAfter that incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nOr it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of Brian Brown is a social researcher yeah shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that chain need secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs on and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from\nOthers who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend or family member but\nHearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it knowing how many of the people I Love and care about\nAnd know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice\nThe real power in and sharing our stories and our numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real at\nAt the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if he checked patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant and are you do in me just went on for almost two years\nMore and let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise] I\n... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper Jeff Flake or or ... to me how responsible for that ...\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a sign of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rape is there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug anyone and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how this might be playing out differently from meal\nThank you for bringing this up because I'm\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there's even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel can identify with Dr Ford or would they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to him felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from at Mel perpetrators but\nWe also need to hear from mail allies and met males too had similar experiences I think that um that would also help this movement um advance\n... professor Conan what about the the nature of the reaction that someone gives you when you first share that story of sexual assault I imagine that that has a big impact on the way that you internalize process to deal with it there after\n... ... you're absolutely right it can have maybe the biggest impact um she'll ... survivors who share their stories and are there heard with support\n'em and I'm sort of allowed to speak as much as they want give us much detail as they want 'em to keep control over their story I'm Lauren mentioned you know control and um that's really important so listening and hearing and not pushing for ... for details or the person doesn't want to give\n'em they um are much more likely to feel better and sort of recover more quickly than someone who's blamed or questioned or um some people mentioned being ridiculed laughed at dismissed and that can be devastating and um\nIt's really reinforces the owned the survivors own probably tendency to blame herself in question her own actions", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
