calls California election special\nThe midterms are next week and in order for Democrats to win the house they need to flip twenty four Republican seats here in California where Hillary Clinton won four million more votes than Donald Trump it is a crucial state for Democrats\nDemocrats are targeting ten Republican held districts and analysts say they probably will not take back control of the house without winning at at least a few of those seats in California\nSo what are the most competitive races\nWho are the candidates and what are they stand for today we're joined by Brian ... a political reporter with the Sacramento Bee producer of the daily capital alert newsletter and host of California nation the bees political podcast Brian ... joins us on the line from the bees capital bureau in Sacramento Hi Brian welcome to the show\nHey thanks for having me great to be here\nIt's great to have you and congratulations on your new job at the Sacramento Bee\nOh yes go and buy month strong though it's settling in for a year\nWhile you're doing great work thank you for joining us we're also joined today by Ben Christopher ... is covering the election season for ... matters and before that he was writing about the economy and the budget and bend joins us on the line from Berkeley Hi Ben welcome back to the show\nHeard Robert\nIt's great to have you back and ask both of you before we start we've noticed that in the national media some reports say in order for the Democrats to win back the house they have to flip twenty four seats some say twenty five seats dino Brian ... is it twenty four twenty five\nHundred and twenty three from ... maybe I'm not ... helping your cause they're of the ...\nIt twenty three okay thank you and your times had I think twenty four twenty five anyway great twenty three okay\nSo California is now getting national attention Rolling Stone is writing about house races MSNBC had a segment about it last night I'm Ben why has California become is prime strategy for Democrats next\nI imagine that has the rest of the country actually care about how we vote I'm usually we are just sort of written off as a big state but\nUm yeah I mean there are a number of districts here ah you know Republicans hold a fourteen states across the state a congressional seats across the state and seven of them a voter is the majority of voters voted for Hillary Clinton so I think there's the feeling\nThat there's a lot of pickup opportunities here are across the state there's also a feeling that I think\nYou know there are a lot of these traditional um Republican strongholds particularly in orange county and San Diego county\nThat um have you know that they've been Republican for decades\nUm but these are sort of the the types of Republicans who I think a lot of certainly Democrats hope um are turned off by a doll president Donald Trump's particular brand of Republicanism these are sort of\nThe more affluent more well educated or districts um that suddenly look a little bit more competitive and that's certainly what the holes are telling us they're also\nYou know there's a broader story about demographic trends in California with I'm sort of a a falling a white non Latino population and that also bodes well for for Democrats and certainly I'm turning up in those districts as well\n... Brian ... what would you out about this district and these candidates\nWould try and not some historical context where Walters one\nSo ... that that's a a large sizable margin of victory and the fact that we're even talking about this race and the fact that we're talking about people like Dana Rohrabacher and Duncan Hunter by that same or even larger margin is something that cannot be stressed out as important enough when I interviewed\nA the the Orange County Republican chair Fred Whitaker and he told me\nThat the idea that this seat with Walters as competitive as quote mostly made up by the media but it can look at credible polling that shows Democrats with a slight edge or in a statistical tie it seems to tell a different story and I tried to interview a quarter but she wasn't available and\nSurprisingly I did get Mimi Walters to talk me out a gas tax rally a on Wednesday of last week\nAnd she made this race like then was saying a referendum on Trump she's casting this as if we lose the house as Republicans were going to go back to the old Obama era ways apart regulation high high and heavy taxes\nAnd we can't have that so for Walters it's really about putting the heat in a national context to try and mobilize your base and I would like to note to I went to UC Irvine and I talked to Fifteen college students there\nAnd take a guess how many of them said they were voting\nOh no I'm afraid to fifty you'd have to Fifteen\nFifteen college students at UC Irvine\nAll Fifteen\nOh good I'm so glad okay every\nSingle one of them and I went to Cal State Fullerton and there was like Thirteen out of fourteen or or something along those lines so we're seeing a lot of young voter enthusiasm this year uh even though there's a little bit of a lack of awareness as\nTo who they're congressional representatives are but I'm twenty two and I was a recent college graduate and and sort of taken aback by Fifteen for Fifteen and talking to people saying they're registered to vote I think that's something that's worth out into the conversation about forty five [noise]\nWell that's great Brian because the Washington Post had a pretty depressing piece recently the Internet and number of ... college students who are not voting and then I think it was al Jazeera or one of the videos streamers like now that is\nAnd there are a bunch of college students waiting for a bus and the interviewer walked up and said hey who's voting and no one raised their hand [laughter] I mean this had been again this just goes back to the need for civics classes\nFrom junior high all the way through college so people can realize that their thoughts and they have they actually have power\nIf they are they going to vote and get involved in an issue they care about\nI mean is it unfair to the post and and some of the counter narratives you're saying about young people not voting young people are are not filing mail in ballots as early as other generations\nSo we don't really have a lot of reliable data at this point showing enthusiasm or lack there of one way or the other so it is still anecdotal in early to say but\nI I think it's interesting to note some of\nThe enthusiasm I observed on the ground\nAnd I'm Sorry I urge that sort of just to have and we\nDid during the um the primary which you know generally midterm primary is a pretty dismal and two dozen fortune the last one was\n... I Believe a record low turnout this year we had the highest a midterm primary turnout so whether or not to Ninety eight I Believe and so there was a lot of them do given up there\nAnd early voting is huge and I was just thinking about the Parkland students ... Miami Herald reports that used to voter registration went up forty one percent in Florida after Parkland students started there get out the vote campaign\nToday it's our your call California election special and we are talking about competitive house races at California is getting national attention Democrats are targeting fourteen Republican held seats ten are considered competitive\nAnd number of analysts say that the Democrats probably won't take control of the house without winning at least a few of those seats here in California\nIf you have any questions or comments for our guests Bryan Anderson is a political reporter\nWith the Sacramento Bee producer of the daily capital ... newsletter and host of California nation the biggest political podcast and been Christopher is covering the election season\nFor count matters they also do great reporting on California politics you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five most of these races are in Southern California but it's always good to know what's going on\nIn Southern California has such a massive state and there's some competitive races happening things can really change next week you can also email your call it K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G. let's hear from Susan in San Francisco Hi Susan welcome to the show\nHigh ... running I was able to find her name on the ballot is he running on those campaigning down in Southern California was Gavin Newsom but I Want to know if she's running and where she's been on the ballot and she is running\nNo she's not so she was elected Senate and twenty sixteen and they serve for six years so she won't be on the ballot until twenty twenty two\nWell what about your friends he's running and what she did at the same time\nDianne Feinstein\nHe's an Feinstein's she's running this year\nThis time around it'll be on your\nBalance is okay that's okay thank you All right I think you I I think\nMaybe I could clarify one one point for that that my older\nOr so in the house of representatives you they run every two years so you see the exact same people showing up on your ballot at every cycle with the U.S Senate every six years\nBut it's not every six years for all senators across the country only about a third of them go every two years so that the the\nThe confusion maybe that that she's seeing there\nMay be another source of confusion murdered by your Google or walk very\n... and partly because she was a big name and she's very popular among\nDemocrats certainly and she's probably um you know a good way to to redraw times on to the ... down ... ... or you know there's a lot of speculation that you're going to be rather\nRather than if you heard of a random food or that you'd rather than um and so that you're seeing a lot of water and then there's probably more\nWell I Hope that helps Susan so this time around Dianne Feinstein and Kevin de Leon will be on your ballot we spoke with Kevin de Leon actually last Wednesday Dianne Feinstein did not get back to us a ... interview requests and you can find that interview with Kevin de Leon at your call radio dot O. R. G.\nAnd if you'd like to join us the toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and in about ten minutes we will speak with the league of women voters Carol moon Goldberg and take your question last minute questions about voting\nAbout what's happening at the polls are if you have any questions about measures [noise]\nAll right so we talked about two races [noise] what else what other races are closely following Brian\nCompetitive races in California for the house according to the cook Political Report of those eleven\nThere seem to be a that we're looking at more closely which are for ten twenty five thirty nine forty five forty eight forty nine and fifty the main you know to our northern California six or Southern California\nAnd of those races on the the general pattern that we're we're seeing is a lot of focus on\nSome of these new figures who haven't been heard before such as Mike loving and districts forty nine competing in an open seat against Diane Harkey that's the likeliest to go to the Democrats if you talk to any expert and district thirty nine is another open seat between guilt is near as in young Kim\nSaid the open seat races seem to be very tight but the interesting thing to note as well as your places like district fifty in San Diego county with Duncan Hunter who won the twenty sixteen\nElection by twenty seven percentage points and that's the largest margin of victory for any person who's in a contested competitive race right now\nLet's talk about Duncan Hunter seat you just reminded me of an article I read in the New York times back in August called Dunkin' hunters political promise foiled by hard partying and a corruption scandal\nDuncan Hunter was a fixture on the bar scene according to the New York times and spent lavishly over four hundred dollars for thirty tequila shots and a bachelor party he visited one of his bars sometimes multiple times a day piling up thousands of dollars in tabs\nAnd on occasion he'd get into loud arguments the patrons much of a choice of music on ... box ... a lot of 'em are articles about Duncan Hunter and how he spends his money well what is the update on mass\nBut it still largely neck and neck in within the margin of error so out of the testicles high\nThis has been a traditional GOP leaning area and it does appear that hoarders message is getting out to voters and he has somewhat of a narrow lead at this point\nAnd what would you add Ben\nYeah I mean I I Would say that the what would the cars\nAre familiar story for me at least anecdotally I don't know the data but certainly there are certain especially on the weekends the out of of an exodus of of a bay area I'm liberal heading over over the hills over to Tracy and just to get out the vote I Would say that this\nDistrict is um interesting in the way that a lot of a Central Valley districts are where they tend to elect\nA voters their time to relax Republicans but we're Democrats registered Democrats actually a number of registered Republicans and so I think from a democratic perspective the hope is that this year for various reasons and probably number one reason being President Trump that turnout\nAmong Democrats will be will be a lot higher\nAnd the Sacramento Bee points out that Tim has proved to be a loyal such soldier for Trump events Ninety seven point eight percent of the time to further Trump's agenda far higher percentage than many for Republicans to disguise very conservative ask\n'em what what can you tell us about the differences between these two candidates that really stands out trying I mean specifically when we're talking about health care women's rights tax cuts is it pretty obvious they on opposite side of the spectrum\nWell I think it's clear that they are very different candidates to to put it mildly or like you said done on boats with Trump more than Ninety seven percent of the time\nAnd that is something to note that I'm sure Josh Harder will not vote for Trump Ninety seven percent of the time so there's a clear right\nDistinct difference as far as issues go I I Do see a lot of differences in terms of health care both both I Believe had said that they're in favor of pre existing conditions that you hear that\nA lot right now with Republican trend methods that way so as far as differences by issues you can look towards the environment you could look towards healthcare you could look towards education and almost anything you could probably bought a difference but\nWhat I Would say is is this is a race where\nVoters will have a choice to go into very different directions\nAnd just\nOh sure or just to add to that I mean I guess one area where I'm congressman Denham has tried to mock himself as as a somewhat more moderate position is on the issue of immigration and that's not surprising given district has quite a number of immigrants and also um\nYou know frankly farmers who who rely on a labor from\nFrom a lot of uh immigrants um but yeah a lot of other issues when he voted for the the the federal tax legislation he wrote in to repeal Obamacare um and I believe he also voted to strip a sanctuary state and thanks for a city or jurisdictions as a federal funding so he's a\nVery consistent a Republican partisan that's ...\n... it's interesting that Republicans now saying that they support\nTo give insurance to people with preexisting conditions were as a you know a couple of years ago they wanted to get rid of all of it but what happens when the people have a taste of something that is just common sense\nAnd then they wanted including Republicans all of a sudden the Republicans are now support preexisting conditions are you hearing that from many of these California Republicans Brian\nOh you are in a row yeah in district forty eight as a prime example there's an ad from leave October fourth or fifth the tweet it out\nAnd had a bad a retweet to reply ratio like a hundred and fifty retweet one thousand plus replies and ... is a on a surfboard walking across the beach and saying that he supports preexisting condition and I interviewed a\nDemocrat hardly rooted who was quick to point out that\nHe voted against pre existing conditions on multiple occasions so regardless of the fact you certainly do feel a lot of\nA high profile Republican even the most the most Trump loyal Congress numbers really going and saying oh I've always been favored preexisting conditions\nOr President Trump and fill up with Florida so if you're like well we will be but [laughter] she's\nJust wait until we have universal healthcare imagine how the opinions on that are going to change the brain Anderson is a political reporter with the Sacramento Bee producer of the daily capital alert newsletter and host of California nation to be as political podcast Brian thank you for your work and thanks so much for joining us\nThanks for having me good talking to you\nYou too thank you and been Christopher is

R. G. slash see a and you can also find it at your call radio dot org before we talk about a few issues Carol ... what are you hearing from voters this is anyone having problems is there any information you want to get out to voters\n[noise] um I think that I haven't been hearing about problems we're fortunate to live in California\nI think that and the five counties that have the voter's Choice Act where they've system from polling places to vote centers and drop boxes there have been um a lot of questions about that um San Mateo county is one of those counties Sacramento County I think those are the two biggest counties that have a\n... made the shift and so eh eh put any change I think people are a little confused about that and so we are getting calls about that mostly\nAnd and what are the major changes\nUm the changes are in those five counties I'm every registered voter gets to vote by mail ballot they should have gotten one by October ninth or tenth of the latest\nUm and they're given the option to either nail in the ballot like you would with any vote by mail or drop it off in a number of secure voter drop off places they can that can be in libraries like there's a whole list\nA when a voter gets the information in the ballot there also given a list of places where they can drop the ballots off um and in that case they would fill out the ballot put it in that ping pong below\nSigned the outside of the ballot always find the outside of that I'm ... and um take it's a secure Dropbox where you get to put it in and um those are taken every day back to the registrars office\nOn the other aspect of it is a move towards vote centers rather than polling places and vote centers are sort of many um county elections offices so if you're still copy on your ballot um you can go get a new one out of votes center or if you accidentally mark something you didn't mean to\nUm you can go get a different ballot um we have to surrender the existing ballot in order to get a new one so they are a full service vote center some of them are open as many as ... eleven days before the election I Know in Sacramento they opened um last Saturday", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "31"}
