A. L. W. dot L. Archie last week California senator Kevin de Leon and Senator Dianne Feinstein had their first and is it safe to guess it is it going to be your only really face to face conversation senator daily on\nWell unfortunate that maybe the reality we had asked months ago for three debates a one and at Stanford University her alma mater a one in Southern California and one in Central Valley in Fresno and I think that it it is important because it shows respect to the voters\nOr a present ourselves to the voters who we are\nOr what we stand for what our vision is what our accomplishments are\nAnd what we want to do it given the opportunity to be your voice in Washington DC um they didn't want to do the debates uh we had hoped that the PBA see debate\nA in San Francisco last week would be a formal debate a with a independent journalist a live television that seven pm at night\nWith the vast majority electorate in California could actually view with themselves um but um unfortunately the negotiations um there was a refusal to um adhere to that you know they want at lunchtime no live television\nNo independent journalist 'em to ask questions um so I think it was a fortune I think it was deeply unfortunate because it's an opportunity in a very difficult time in our nation's history for voters to hear what our views are and more importantly what would we do if given the opportunity to be their voice in Washington\nAnd we've had several invitations to Senator Dianne Feinstein the her office has not responded to our invitation senator deli on why did you decide to run at such an expensive state as you know to run in and fortunately at Senator Dianne Feinstein is a long time household name why did you decide to run\nYou know I like I said you know a few moments ago these are very dangerous consequential times in our nation's history and when I heard that our senior senator or at the San Francisco commonwealth club last year\nStated that um that we needed to be patient ah with President Trump and hopes that in the hopes that he could be a good president in the future\nThat hit me like a two by four across the forehead uh I was stunned by the comment because comet showed a lack of deep understanding what was happening in the country but especially what was happening here in California\nA mothers and fathers will be pursued by ice agents are children who are uh uh uh weddings id panic fear because they don't know if their mothers are going to pick them up after school if they'd been detained by ice agents this was after the president pulled out of the Paris accords twenty Fifteen on climate change is after the Muslim ban\nThis is um after three weeks after the tragedy of Charlottesville, Virginia\nAnd to have the senior senator make such a comment\nUm was um uh was shocking to say the least so I thought that perhaps\nA California needs an an alternative voice a new voice or a new vision a a a new approach and and and change and I was honored in lucky enough to get into the top two a a huge field thirty two candidates\nNurses of California I'm working men and women who are home care workers in janitors and men and women who work in the ports of long Long Beach in LA and Oakland and San Francisco and\nIt's been incredible journey to go up and down the city California last night I was in Fresno vice cellular sangre\nToday I'm In Los Angeles helping San Diego and in a couple of hours I'm I'm traveling up and down the state talking to all voters and but that was the reason why and being the youngest child is single immigrant mother with a third grade education a woman who worked her fingers to the bone working in the very wealthy ... California\nUh I I was offended by that comment and it showed me the the huge a disconnection or the cognitive dissonance between the senior senator in Washington and the reality of everyday California\nAs you know I mean you said that you feel like the status quo in Washington is not fighting back you know a lot of people lately have ... are saying what what is Chuck Schumer doing\nYou know where is Nancy Pelosi I mean where is the Democratic party I mean of course there are different sets of Democrats in DC like there are in Sacramento more progressive more corporate what kind of senator would you be in terms of\nYou know what you kind of put yourself out there a lot of people are wondering this kind of like Harris was she going to put herself out there quickly and or or was she going to hold back\nWhat what would you say especially in this this very difficult time\nDoing these very difficult times I'd be doing what I've been doing a today you know speaking truth to power on the issues that I care deeply about for everyday Californians fighting for\nA health care for all or not to Medicare for some of fighting for what is an existential threat to our humanity to our way of life to apply to the issue of climate change\nFighting for immigration reform because I Believe our nation has turned its back on our family of immigrants I'm\nSpeaking truth to power even if ... mathematical you in the minority you don't uh psychologically assume the mindset of being in the minority\nA these are issues these are values that Californians as Americans care deeply about do you have to speak truth to power you just can't say well you know what we're mathematically in the minority we just can't do nothing we're just going to resign ourselves to be on the sidelines as opposed to the front lines\nAnd in and do and accomplish the issues that that I was successful here moving California one hundred percent clean energy raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour equal pay for women doing equal work I'm\nA century stay on the ... century state um folks say well you know easier said than done Kevin because the Republicans control or the or the bike camera legislative branch of the government as well as the judicial branch and\nUh the executive branch doesn't make a difference because you have to speak truth to power and you have to fight for your values are in Washington DC and quite frankly I simply don't see that with our senior center I see a the comedy\nOf a bygone era where folks perhaps got along with each other to a certain degree um but that's no longer the case I mean these Republicans a exercise power unlike any anyone we've ever seen before uh and uh unfortunately but the reality is they go for the jugular\nAnd we are playing by this country club rules in Washington DC and that doesn't work for California\n[noise] can you were speaking with California state senator Kevin de Leon who is running to represent California and Washington at a U.S senator and if you have any questions or comments for senator daily on the number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your colleague K.

A. L. W. dot org let's hear from John in San Francisco Hi John welcome to the show\nTo denounce Hi John how you doing good morning\n\nI'm doing well about a just a work in this campaign going up and down the state\n... it's like to Canada in California\nLeadership and many of the idea that you are talking about my own family I didn't want to hear what the question related to that and homeownership and\nWe're suffering a major crisis which homelessness which may be related to a mental health this year and a lot going on here\nUm you mentioned that your own rent or your whole life and what I'm Wondering is what is your\nPosition on home ownership in California after like a private enterprise in private enterprise maybe I'll be in the current crisis by building more on not pro government enabling ran of pride in the market itself\nWell listen I you know if folks want to own a home their own property I'm a I'm for it I'm not against it a\n... I Believe ... part of the the challenge is getting access to capital and if you're working family and you want to own home I'm going to be quite challenging given the devaluation of property today especially\nIn the bay area because the lack of been matory the lack of stock to begin with\nBut that's where we have to start building in very smart intelligent way that does that are adverse impact the environment but we have to build there's no question about it it doesn't make a difference if you're on the left or right you have to start building more housing if we can start dropping the price point of getting access to a purchasing a home but but that being said\nYou need access to capital and I don't think that the traditional banks right now a contingent on your psycho score or lending money or to folks whose quality paper is not Supreme and that's why you know the rich get richer\nBecause when the quality of your paper or is very high you get access to capital and when you're trying to make ends meet but you want that American Dream that California Dream\nUm you're not going to get access to the Capitol I think that we need to do better with regards to financial products at a low ... uh interest point price point a so working families can get access to it\nUm I'm not into irresponsible lending but I Will say this\nIs that if you do lend a and their cases with certain banks are there non traditional banks if you do lend to working class families they have a very high rate of pay back their loan or in not defaulting so I I don't believe the banks have been very helpful truth be told\nWith getting access to capital tactically we can raise the minimum wage we can\nCreate more parks and open space we can have health care these are all tactics overall to a a improve the quality of life the human condition for all Californians for all Americans but getting access to capital is really really critical and I think we have a huge problem in in this country\nWell thank you for calling in John and Saturday early on I wanted to also ask you about us foreign policy before we end the shell and this is another issue that came up during that conversation you were in with Senator Feinstein last week\nThat more than six trillion dollars\nAnd for example in Iraq and Afghanistan and these various wars that are lasting incredibly long you also said\nAnd you know you rarely hear that some Democrats quote we need to get out of the business bombing of the nation and we've got to get out of the business of nation building you don't go and bomb a whole country and invade a whole country\nTo deal with the issue of terrorism this really stood out for me because I rarely hear Democrats say these things why is that\nWell it's I think it's just common sense rose I Am not a a foreign policy expert and you know [laughter] I to me it's common sense when you will for war we have to realize what's at stake or that we're talking about American lives or their lives and American taxpayer dollars\nAnd when Washington sends our children our families are loved ones into war\nAre and where they have no credible plan to get them back home that tells me that something's wrong with individuals who are making the decisions and those who vote to enable the federal government to go into these wars and Senator Dianne Feinstein\nHas contingency voted for Afghanistan and Iraq and and to date a we've had we've been in Afghanistan for Seventeen years the cost of this war has been the disenfranchisement of an entire generation\nAnd their families who will never see their children again their children and the sons and daughters who will never see their mothers and fathers again\nAnd we need an immediate plans to exit Afghanistan because the British uh invaded Afghanistan and tried to conquer Afghanistan or the former Soviet Union\nOr try to conquer a Afghanistan a war there now Seventeen years that's longer than the Vietnam War we sent spent close to two maybe three trillion dollars in Afghanistan alone\nThe regions not safer or we invaded Iraq Senator Feinstein voted for that war in Iraq\nAnd be mindful about one thing\nLet's not forget that ISIS was created directly from the resistance to the invasion in Iraq there was no you ISIS or before the Iraq War so Dianne Feinstein\nAcquiesced in collaborated with George W. Bush with Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney\nThis is their war about we're paying the price for it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein was a yes vote up for the Iraq War as well as in Afghanistan these wars and when when our representatives ... take their votes or make their votes in Washington they have huge consequences so if we're spending six trillion dollars today\nOn these two wars and we're selling weapons to the Saudis and they say well we have no money\nFor helping homeless are folks oh we have no money to really shore up the budgets of hard to deal with the issue of affordability we have no money to deal with kids who are saddled with debt or paying with principle and interests well into the thirties and forties and fifties when they graduate from college is the graduate from college\nAnd very few graduate from college in four years or let's say we have no money for health care or we need to privatize Social Security we need to increase the age of Social Security because it's not sustainable well of course\nBecause we've been spending money elsewhere Juppe tax cuts which sign a center fights I voted for in the past along with two wars\nAnd those are the values that are not reflective of who we are today as a state where innovative were created for disruptive we challenge the status quo we're the most diverse state in the nation if not the entire world\nAnd that's why we need a new voice because when we're dealing with the issue of foreign policy\nFolks who are fleeing Central America because they're caught between the Colombian drug lords the manufacturers and the largest consumer on planet earth of illicit drugs which is the United states America\n... deep entrenched poverty you have climate change that as wrecking a already very difficult poverty poverty stricken nations that never had strong democratic institutions\nJudicial legislative executive branch you have a U.S government that always aided you know strong than dictators in Central America that felt foreign policy of the United states\nContributes greatly to the mass migration patterns\nTo the United states of America [noise] and do these are the decisions that are made in Washington DC\nAnd Senator Feinstein last year titled matter Jones that quote\nA you know voting for the invasion of Iraq and two thousand to call it the decision that I regret the most and I have to live with it and I can I Wish we could have had her on today to ask about these issues that we did reach out to senator Feinstein's office and she did not respond to our invitation\nThat senator daily on just recently a couple of months ago forty Democrat forty Democrats and the Senate\nJoined Republicans and voted for a seven hundred and Seventeen billion dollar military spending ... which does not include money for health care so much of ask us to weapons companies Senator Dianne Feinstein did vote for that how would you have added on that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
