A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a\nSusanna Craig let me start with you how did this report come about I assume it was kind of a natural outgrowth of the times is previous reporting about Donald Trump after he declared himself to be a candidate it\nIt was we I'm In late two thousand and a sixteen I was mailed three pages of\nDonald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns and all of his reporting as sort of been in one way or another you know just an outgrowth of our our study of his taxes and and and those taxes in particular showed something very interesting which was not your Donald Trump at a loss\nEssentially gave him a bit of a gift card from the IRS allowed him to shelter hot up almost a billion dollars going forward um and we learn then six months later we thought you know these losses were so huge\nAnd then in March to thousands Seventeen three more pages of his tax returns um are found um released on Rachel Maddow show\nAnd they show that he made a hundred and fifty million dollars that year and this was for two thousand five and this thing started with a simple question which is how did we get from this law to this profit in two thousand\nAnd five and we just started to to ask questions around that and pulse string and we quickly realized after that that much of it um came from a sale of his father's real estate in two thousand and for his father Fred Trump the real estate developer who died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd we just started to pull and pull and pull and we realized um as we did in the reporting went on just the great fortune that that Donald Trump um inherited not just in two thousand four from his father after his death that throughout his life year by year a writer by dollar loan by loan\n... can you give us a sense of how you reported this out I I Know you've gotten a number of documents from a number of sources tax returns are not a document that presidential candidates or or anyone really is required to release\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump at least one\nShelters lifted as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bond that was sent to John Brennan was sent in care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise]\nLater during a rally in Wisconsin and in a tweet the president once again urged unity but he also blame the press for supposedly stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote this story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot\nThat we do not know including who is behind the suspicious devices and what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep that keep you up to speed as quickly as we can you'll get more details of course on your NPR member station and online at NPR dot org\nLet's get back to our discussion about the Trump family empire and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan ... must be ... of the New York times we walk more of your questions about this investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us ... won a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities but weren't\nSuzanne and one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when Fred Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business was off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than the valuation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once\nI'm sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuation of you know five ten million\nBut on the same amount when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately said the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer rough [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed\nBy a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took ownership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of when pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people the trumps really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent in a ... voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all areas\nThat he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do we all take adoption standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to Jeff\n...\nThe top I mean these aren't standard deductions one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the ... you mentioned um with a company that was set up it's it's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich\nCross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the higher for fraud the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're talking\nTens and tens of millions of dollars so what they did was for years Fred Trump he would go out and he would buy supplies for his buildings you know we're talking boilers paint everything boilers paint supplies fridge is does all those sort of things and then one day\nInstead of him buying it all counties starts buying all of this stuff all county is owned by Donald Trump and his siblings and another family member\nAnd all counties starts paying for all this stuff and they'll pay let's say three hundred dollars for an air conditioner ... the company all county then created a padded receipt and with Bill Fred Trump five hundred dollars for the same air conditioner the two hundred dollars in profit was divided between siblings\nAnd then there's another step so they start they drain cash they drained we sought millions and millions of dollars from Fred Trump's empire ... money that no they no longer have to pay the estate tax on then they turn around and they take those receipts\nOr don't plan on voting why or why not\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one egg again for starters if you live in Kansas Michigan or Colorado is there a candidate or ballot initiative that you're passionate about or if you do not plan on voting why not\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nThat's eight five five to three six one two one two you'll find more details on one a across America on line at the one eight dot org will share some of your stories and tell you a bit more about across America this Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Susan Craig and ... of the New York times two times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of\nThis is their job to catch the French trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through I'm an ... I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the ...\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were ... where were problems are found and eventually they come to his settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or or their statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne would you say there as well\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent\nWhen I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he it incurred throughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would've been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips\nOne of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us so\nThat was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in its darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he owns owed to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue the casinos his father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rain down to a full force civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality\nI mean we talked about one area without county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that vote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at um\nWhat is this could they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be lower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Suzanne ...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald\nDollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there's no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire\nBut what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune um and where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um stay he didn't get revenue or money from other areas um you know there's been stories that some of it it's come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\nUm over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line\nUm to shelter from having to pay taxes I think that's an important chapter and the president's life that\nYou know people can digest it the way they want it but it's it's important at least to us that those stocks and not truth is out there\nThere's also like a secondary aspect to that as well he's always portrayed his father is too much of a small timer that any money to be even of interest to him and what we've seen clearly sue scribe who they're rewriting of his father's will in Nineteen Ninety\nOr in these various schemes that Donald Trump engineered in the nineties uh when he was like it a low point is it not only was his father of incredible wealth his father himself fifty million dollars in Nineteen Ninety when Donald Trump was flat broke\nA but Donald Trump care very much about getting as much of that wealth that he could he went beyond the bounds of law unsettling says to try to claw as much as he could\nAnd all the time that he was doing this over the decades he was hiding it from public view very aggressively and that really does kind of if you're interested in Donald Trump's real life story rewrite that story\nI mean it's it's not the story that you were going to read and I'm In the art of the deal where you know everything that Donald Trump got was got you know by his own hard work and\nAnd uh and shoo Heather I'm you know business smarts and all that it's a story um we found that sucks about it at about a young boy from the time he was very young who got millions of dollars every year from his father and really every ... that he made ... covered", "show_name": "1A
