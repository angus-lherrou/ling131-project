Peter feel is supporting Gavin Newsom he is a venture capitalist who supported Donald Trump and the twenty sixteen presidential election\nJohn Cox a Republican is a real estate investor from San Diego who is estimated to be worth more than one hundred million dollars according to the LA Times\nJohn Cox funded his campaign with five point six million dollars from his personal bank account and has raised another four point six million dollars from donors including professional financial investors a property investment firm and marine and cinema counties\nUs to talk about where these to stand on issues are two guests Phil ... covers California politics for the LA Times state Capitol bureau in Sacramento he previously covered Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ... show\nWhich led to beer great to have you\nLearned Rosenthal covers California politics for ... with a focus on power and personalities and the state house her weekly news analysis explains political dynamics and the capital and examines how many advocacy and relationships shape the decisions that affect Californians Hi Laurel thank you for joining us welcome back\nHi rose happy to be here and great to have you so what do you think about what Gavin Newsom I mean really it sounds like it was his decision because John\nI mean this wasn't even on TV this is on ... D at ten am and I'm guessing a lot of people didn't even know about it ... what are your thoughts on this\nJoseph ... it sounded like a leash a ton of didn't want anyone to watch or hear what was going on I think it's not really a surprise given that he's the the the front runner in the race and this has been a trend\nEspecially in California and then we should general elections where the front runner doesn't want to give any oxygen to their opponent and if you had a series of debates so kind of lifted that would have lifted John Cox his profile\nSettled would've put them on the two of them on par\nAnd it's not really to newsrooms advantage to do that um it is to talk to his advantage to have a series of debate so that's why he's been somewhat frustrated\n[noise] what are your thoughts on this Laurel um\nOh I completely agree you know for new some this is his race to lose at this point given his advantage in the polls and in the fundraising so I could imagine that there would be no incentive to create any opportunities to mess up you know and so\nUm he's gonna make his public appearances in as scripted in a controlled environment as he can where he is going to be surrounded by supporters and not have any opportunity to um you know face off with someone who who who who could somehow\nUh talks is going to lose him quite hard about all the ills of San Francisco as far as like some of the open road the street the homeless is I'm a that a lot of the larger cities were on the street or are facing\nA new some I mean it hasn't been mayor of San Francisco students are obviously two thousand eleven\nG um instilled many programs I Would hope alleviate those problems but here's a bit of the wheel for years\nAnd Laurel what can you tell us about Gavin Newsom and where he stands on issues I mean he talks about inequality and poverty but what what is he planning to do to tackle these issues [noise]\nHe he's really talking a lot about\nEarly childhood and even prenatal care um and sort of tackling these problems from the root cause which is kind of how ... we have massive inequalities in our state you know just from the get go for that\nThan persist and and get worse as you know children enter their school years and then you know so many don't go on to college at cetera so he that is one piece of what he's talking about is um is you know I'm a huge investment in\nUm in prenatal care in um early childhood education so ... even zero to three years expanding preschool all of that\nThe huge enormous question mark with that as many you know those are extremely expensive propositions and um\nAnd there's not it's you know it it would take\n... ... it would take either new money I eat taxes to pay for it or decisions to not pay for other things that we're currently paying for and so those specific conversations have not yet been hashed out and I'm ... and and that is a\nIs a big question I I think on the issue of poverty generally speaking as far as the politics of talking about poverty we're seeing California Republicans really make this an issue\nAnd it's very um interesting and it's also I think smart they are\nDying for relevancy because their numbers are dwindling so massively and the state\nAnd they're really trying to find a message that can help them kind of gain relevancy I'm with lots of Californians and the\nMessage from Republicans at the national level\nIs um you know very unwelcome ing too large parts of the California population um who are young and who are people of color and so the the national Republican sort of branding\nIs um is not going to be welcoming too many people in California so what you have is California Republicans at the state level really trying to do this message that will reach more people and so talking about poverty\nIs one way to do that and they are it's it's so good it's a good message because it's true they haven't been in power here\nThey don't have to take responsibility for the problems that we have it's easy to put it on Democrats who have been making\nAll the decisions for the last many years\nUm and also talking about poverty is a way to kind of scoop up lots of other smaller issues that do sit well with the Republican message for example in this election cycle the gas tax you know so Republicans are\nCampaigning for proposition six which is to repeal the twelve cent tax on gas that Democrats approved last year to pay for road repairs\nAnd so you know talking about repealing taxes\nUm you're paying too much for gas you know life is too expensive we have the highest poverty rate in the in the nation you know that kind of all goes together\nUm and similarly on the cost of housing ah that also that mess that sort of overarching message of hammering on poverty and the cost of living here works well for Republicans because they are also arguing for\nIn the world and the kind of business at housing construction and making the case that if we didn't have such owner is um\nRegulations and rules and environmental laws in this state that they would be easier and faster and cheaper to build housing which would then reduced the cost of housing so it's an interesting um it's an interesting message and it's a way for Republicans to vote or\nTry to reach more voters and build up their brand and also um deliver sort of pieces of their platform that are in keeping with kind of Republican traditional values\nSo they're talking about poverty but what do they want to do about it I mean Paul Ryan spent years talking about poverty but he also wanted to cut Medicare and Social Security\nOr yell at me like like Laurel or said it'll be for new some whose prescription is to a multi pronged one as early education he he also wants um support universal health care to make sure that people don't go bankrupt\nUm are paying for medical bills um he wants to he said\nTransform the economy um uh for the future knowing that\nUh some major forces out there like automation may be putting a lot of people out of work um so he he's talking about some really broad brush policies um talks um again is talking about cutting taxes plenty more more money in people's pockets\nOriginally in the gas tax putting regulations and hope that will um increase uh uh there's a success and the state and create more jobs so the we're not hearing a lot of specifics about exactly what they're going to do in the future is a lot of really kind of um a subtle I view type of a\nA policy of proposals that they're putting out there\n[noise] this is your calls election special today we are talking about the governor's race they took part in their first and only debate on Monday on ... D at ten AM you can listen to it we can find a link at your call radio dot O. R. G. was just an hour\nThey did not open the lines but they did bring in some questions by listeners who called in earlier at just one debate for the governor's seat John Cox that he wants to do more debates but Gavin some\nHas refused and today we're talking about this important race with Phil will on he covers California politics for the Los Angeles times state Capitol bureau and Sacramento and Laurel Rosen hall covers California politics\nFor cow matters and news websites nonprofit they do really great work on California issues and if you have any questions about this race have you been following it what do you want to know about work avenue some and John Cox stand\nOn the crucial issues facing our state you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and if you listened to the debate what stood out for you you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nSince we're talking about taxes Laurel or ... have you been able to ask we know that as John Cox wants to cut taxes ... have you been able to ask Gavin Newsom where he stands on taxes\nUh well yeah he supports the gas tax we know that and um as far as income or or other taxes I'm a you know I'm not sure if he's laid out of the broad tax proposal like like a talk show ... but he has come out in favor of the gas tax\nSaying that is the central for or against the five billion are going to be raised annually for that are essential to keep our roads and a public transportation systems running smoothly and ... has really\nWe can we can do all this through a efficiency a Caltrans I'm ... and basically saying we'd have to lay off\nThe entire department in order to like twice over three times over to make up some of the money so I mean the gas tax has been the biggest split between the two on on that issue I mean to Fox has talked a lot and really broad terms about wanting to lessen the tax burden\nBut as far as specific plans ... he'll cut I mean I have not heard of\nThe issue of ... Thirteen came up at the debate the other day and you know new some said he was sort of wanting to have a discussion about changing prop Thirteen he didn't\nCommit to any specific proposals but said that he thought it was something that should be discussed and I know I'm you know when we had to when we interviewed him a couple of months ago um he talked about wanting to sort of\nConvene I'm a really broad discussion on on the tax structure in California I mean these are things that are\nReally not sexy 'em and hard for a lot of people to wrap their brains around but there's a there's a lot of wacky things with the way taxes are in California and prop Thirteen is by far not the only thing I'm you know we also have a tax structure that\nRelies extremely heavily on\nWealthy people and I'm In order to fund the services for very poor people but the the\nThe way it's structured means that when you know that the stock market crashes and those wealthy people have a bad year the amount of money that the state gets to fund programs for poor people\n[noise]\nUm I think he is going to be you know more\nProgressive than Jerry Brown I mean he's basically said he's wanted to kind of continue Jerry Brown's vision on a lot of issues like um you know his climate change policies and ah\nThe high speed rail and um and but then I think in some other areas he said he's wanted to push it even further um basically further to the left so you know brown has resisted 'em this eh activism around\nBanning fracking new some ... you know didn't commit to it but sort of seemed open to limiting fracking\nUm he also said you know he supported the changes Jerry Brown has made on criminal justice but said there might be some areas or even want to kind of push even further\nUm so I Would expect him to be progressive on a lot of issues I'm including environment including social um criminal justice [noise]\nUm and I think that and that the the question mark is on you know fiscal policy I mean and and that's huge because the state spends most of its money I'm On public education and health care for the poor\nAnd so if you want to be um progressive on those two issues then you really need a lot of money to do it and then the next question becomes you know what are you going to not spend money on or are you going to raise taxes to spend more money in those two areas\nThat's really going to be the story over the next four years in a lot of ways because there's going to read a lot of tension between the governor's office and I think\nThe state legislature there's a lot of pent up desire among our state legislature to for a lot of these programs and the the that deserves been bridal to a great degree by Jerry Brown\nSo I'm here you have new stuff coming in with all these promises a about pre K. funding about universal health care about keeping keeping the high speed rail project going I'm doing making all these major investments in the money has to come from somewhere and the question is where\nAnd on the horizon and Jerry Brown has warned about this quite a bit is old there's always the chance to do charts now of an economic downturn\nAnd that may Rob the the city treasury or I mean the state treasury of you know billions of dollars so if that happens you know then what are those always promises made and all this all this desire but what what are they going to do and that that's just going to be fascinating to watch and see how that unfolds over the next four years\nYeah I'm so glad you're both bringing this up we need to do a show about just how California spend that money and the tax structure hair because ... California gets international headlines for being the fifth largest economy in the world and we've got the largest most profitable tech companies and the state\nSo many billionaires now not just millionaires and so you hear people say on a regular basis how is it that in this wealthy state\nWe have so much inequality people sleeping on the streets people sleeping in their cars teachers can't make ends meet and I you know I just don't think a lot of people know just how the money is where it comes from and how it's spent do you think that's correct floral [noise]\nI think it is correct and um it's you know it's it's hard it's one of those things\nUm budget nerds or government nerds who just geek out on this stuff and really know it but if you're just an ordinary person going about your life and you're catching\nA little bit of political news here and they're in between doing all of the um important things that matter to you this is not that type of issue that's going to rise to the top I Will say I'll take a moment to kind of plug here\nThat I'm explaining these kind of deep policy issues is that the mission of\nAt the core of our mission that cow matters and if you go to our website at ... dot org you will see on the menu that there is um\nAnd um something we call the explainer is and so we have these explain or is that really do try to make all of this stuff understandable to regular people who are not budget nerds who are not policy wonks\nUm but who wonder about the things we have an outstanding one on the cost of housing and that really explains why the cost of housing is so out of control in California\nWe have an outstanding one on taxes that explains um all of those different sort of pieces of the tax puzzle that I wrote alluded to earlier um and these things are written very um ... in very small chunks of writing and lots of graphic than in a tone that's kind of conversation all and so\nI encourage people to check out ... and um subscribe to our newsletter where we send out daily emails with links to our stories and other important coverage in California and that's ... dot O. R. G. S. L. what would you add\nWell I mean for me the fascinating thing about about California now and even cities like San Francisco and LA is the fact that\nWe're both the richest and the poor state in the nation and a lot of ways the the the recovery from the recession has not been shared a or the at all is is really concentrated in pockets of you know the Silicon Valley in San Francisco in the west side of LA but if you travel to places like\nLibya Inland Empire where I live for about ten years you don't see it there at all the construction trades really have not recovered\nFrom the ... uh two thousand a recession you go to the Central Valley you talked to farmers are you ... you don't see the recovery they're either they're having trouble getting farm workers to stay in the state they're all leaving the state um so that's the most striking thing for me is that there's really is\nThis is really kind of two ... two different states and people are living to defer lives at the same time and\nA and the child to the next governor is to basically a can or raise all boats in a way and it's easier to give lip service to that but um it it is if it can be extraordinarily hard to do especially in this political climate do room a with DC and California at loggerheads with one another\nFilm while uncovered California politics the LA Times and Lauren Rosenthal Covered California politics for count matters today we're talking about the governor's race Kevin ... and John Cox method are first and only debate\nOn Monday on ... D and Laurel you brought up fracking earlier and I want to play a clip from that debate\nThey were both asked about the environment and fracking and this one starts with Gavin somebody's talking about fracking\nJerry Brown has been taken flack from the left from it keep it in the ground a lobby about fracking about drilling in California not off the coast but it in a in the mainland of California would you reverse those policies but he's an\nEthical tying them up I think fracking starting to fall into I'm tired of Wall Street is the one leading this recognition ah you're seen interest rates rise the fracking a experiment is beginning to Wayne so I think that's a natural opportunity for the next governor\nEating in almost every capacity we're creating jobs were leaning into the future of this is California has a great uh ice rink foreign policy is one that I'm very proud that Governor brown has led a and boy I really hope folks are paying attention I Would be very cautious to revert back\nTo the normalization of duty as soon as it relates to a lack of intentionally and leadership around climate change California has a responsibility has an important international role to play I Am committed and passionate about that I Want to lead\nThat's wonderful except that people can't afford to live in the state and they're moving out at our electricity costs or gasoline costs are pounding the average person and it's all well and good to talk about this\nWonderful goal that we have what's worked for it but let's not kill people in terms of their ...\nAnd that's a clip from the debate between ... and John Cox Scott Shafer from ... was moderating that debate that was interesting Laurel when Kevin ... will tighten them up what does that mean and Riley\nYeah great question I mean I it remains to be seen and I think that you know Jerry Brown's argument all along has been he doesn't want to ban oil production in California\nBecause he wants to concentrate on reducing oil consumption with the argument being that as long as ... Californians are buying as much oil as buying as much gasoline oil petroleum based gasoline as we are\nEvery year that I'm reducing production in this state just means that people are going to buy oil that's trucked in here from other states or other countries and so\nHis argument has been he's advancing policies to reduce oil consumption things like um\nYou know there's something called the low carbon fuel standard which basically requires that cleaner blend that has less petroleum based and um you know and other policies that ... that that would urge the state to\nConsume less petroleum and um news hum if he's in a position to you know make those decisions in the future will be faced with that same conundrum do you cut off production", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "10"}
