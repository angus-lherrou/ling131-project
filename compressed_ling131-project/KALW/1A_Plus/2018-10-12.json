A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\nJohn ... we've heard a number of accounts\nDid to Mr to show you that they basically said hit and then after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he walked into the come fill a in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go ... jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men them they they go into a blackout a vans a drove to the ... so the ... generals residents which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken\nAnd they did what they did to him now there are reports circulating that attack ish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd I met the most brutal brutal that's under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia\nOn that gulfstream jets a little later in the day now we know the the planes that were those to paint movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to Riyadh\nWho was on the wall that designation was within the state capital racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will thirties here in the U.S on the side and he's not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that that has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into that category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies any press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about ... disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're looking again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay\nWe're all like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four\nOr five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from home the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case fits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nThere is no reason to maintain close ties with a country that has more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family\nIf I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fat check that\nYeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand it seemed so\nKnow we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I Am so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy and that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said I'm\nNow we're supporting a war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporters this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports of showing that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um you even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. trumping ministry didn't have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this too which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of set the quiet part out loud a little bit and the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money\nAnd oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia that didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values based allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut it's been somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time\nYeah sure sure if I could chip in exile here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister subsided ... could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nA ... and you know it was clear that Saudi ... you've got to call this the core off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy\nAnd highly unusually massively controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was too big a customer\nToo important an ally and you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether that requesting that oh no it's an open question however they they are there and they and Donald Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead John\nFor four we keep ... ... oh I was just\nGoing to say if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month at the un and the United states has pretty aggressive and calling around the biggest threat\nArabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion across the middle east on and of course Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping in Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of um to to what happened in Saudi Arabia and if it is and in fact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside their conflict who was it a rather than the United states\nSpeaking of journalists who have been killed there is another journalists being remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria Murray nova was found over the weekend near the Dan River in northern Bulgarian town she had been raped and strangled\n... apparently German authorities have arrested a suspect in this case do we know anything more about it particularly whether her desk was connected to her reporting\nYeah there's kind of a battle of interpretation over that so they Bulgarian authorities are saying no it was and this was a spontaneous act by someone um they say was wanted for another rape and murder so this someone with a criminal background um ... there are others though who argue that\nWon the authorities were too quick to say this wasn't a contract killing before known all the facts which raises suspicions and then too I think people are just really primed at the moment\nTo see things as retaliation against journalists because we're in a very bad climate for journalists right now and actually in that and I'm married to a final broadcast she had interviewed to investigative journalists who are looking at government corruption and so that raises questions here so we don't know and\nWell he's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalties said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than ... oil and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody but she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see\nOf China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen and so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband it's it's something we don't normally see\nWhat's hard now to Brazil were far right presidential convict ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the rings she nearly took the election with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth\nRe Freidman can you remind us who joy ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nYeah he's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been a Congress for almost three decades um he's a law and order candidate that it's his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he's very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to loosen gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae beauty and one other thing that's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or returning to democracy in Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was law and order one other point to know is that he is an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations\nA you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is I'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about his relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing views\nThat he espoused so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption um crisis odd that affected all parties except for both narrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his\nThat was his winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article in which they interviewed\nA a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this myth and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that is worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nInbred that in Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries in the world\nBut to hear from some Brazilians who are listening and today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm\nSyria I'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massages and homophobic since\nLast Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both ... supporters social media specifically what app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with Wilson out of our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nWas the last poll I saw suggested yes that the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent on the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... Fernandez her dad and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that it's it's with ... sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of kinds of it\nTo come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both not that he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence round but his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates but I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for the stopping that I had been so I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the un Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they saved that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that ... demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nation's already seen\nAs a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat sell on\n... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nI was in Europe at the beginning of the week\nOn the main national news shows a half an hour long and so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean that's one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... ... in America where you get more whether I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet or you could huge amount about whether\nThe climate is not discussed and that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate a competitor in other parts\nOf the world and judge said one thing to that I spoke with the un secretary general Antonio ... recently right before the U.N General assembly and ask them what is the greatest threat the faith right now what is your greatest challenge I expect him to say a voting and disruption with the United states or the conflict in Syria\nHe said climate change he said this is the existential question of our time this is what I'm focusing my most energy on conflicts you can try to solve you can always off if we don't stop at the next few years it becomes a reversible damage and that is what he's running most of attention to you know I thought he is one of the people I thought of this report as\nAlmost the un standing at an intersection in ... and ... wildly to go in one direction in the world in a convoy of cars is zooming Seventy miles per hour and the other direction you know that we are moving not in the direction of what this report recommend than they are saying we need to take action immediately\nYou know the reaction from some international lawmakers has been pretty new to this is environmental campaign or George ... he gave his take on why politicians seem reluctant to speak out on this\nYou know they're just one issue to go way for people start talking about it and it's only won't because it just messes up everything you know all that nice cozy relationship for corporations or a five year plans and everything just goes by the wayside because it\nDoes just question ... premises on which are politics and economics and created\nIts environmental campaign or George ... would be worth noting that we didn't have a longer conversation about this report earlier in the week you'll find that on our website the one a dot org I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one day",
