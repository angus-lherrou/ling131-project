A. M. U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty but in other countries actually guilty David what do you think\nI better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide to announce it as happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders in um\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back you know who to attack\nYeah great married before we move on\nFrom this first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to\nShut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the ... because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of the you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear a Russia China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with us here on\nThe what we've seen in the last couple of days is coordination of um indictments and ... you know raising concerns about I'm signing an otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place where countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter\nThe threat that that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah\nRestrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general and cyber threats and as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves in\nThe past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward and having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nIt's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we felt that we have so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way\nFact that we've got all these different utility company yeah that you know ... but but the key element here as we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the ... digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prizes particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... Luke ... is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims nutty a rod is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state skates captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr McCoy gay founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning this prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handle that with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent\nBut as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue a huge problem that the various factions un peacekeepers were involved in in rape there\nAnd so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been at this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah a dicey region of very deserving winter\nVery I I can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen\nI'm intervening gives you the women who were released from captivity from ISIS and\nThe impact yeah obviously psychologically physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in a war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially an ended by this their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so uh you know it's something that you should raising awareness for that's something really really important and you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq trying to educate these families that this is not of no fault of the women that they had no say in the matter but\nObviously you know changing cultural perceptions it's it's it's an uphill battle and so this woman obviously I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that she's getting\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermined the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy\nDavid what is vice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually used it\nIn the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities\nThat the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it\nIn their arguments with Tibet they've used it internally a lot they've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists the United states put on China\nThey are aiming at states and districts that are key to President Trump\nAnd therefore causing pain\nTo workers there and they're saying that that accounts meddling well if that's the case we've done the same thing and foreign countries where we when we imposed tariffs frequently do it with a political goal in mind you're trying to change the political behavior of the country\nUm the Japanese did it to the United states both in the negative sense with terrorists but also in the positive sense putting a putting facilities mostly car plants in key districts would they want to make sure they maintain some interest\nThere's not a whole lot that is new here what is interesting is that the administration is doing now a broad spectrum attack on Chinese activity today the president is doing something involving the supply chain of parts critical parts of the military and others that the Chinese provide there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I I think um in general it's more just I'm reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions um that we they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBring my we step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise]\nUh I'm sure that was the question of the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking\nTreaty I really am a nature really am I [laughter] think through what we've heard about you know ... the the big acronym to Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what is this treaty of Amman\nWell in Nineteen fifty three the U.S help orchestrate that coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or if they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's yeah you brought me back to power sure treaty of him to the great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until\nThe Seventy nine revolution this is the shah who was deposed in these women revel in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us in a rod um this again seems very symbolic\nI'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution in Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days by mayor was permanent\nRoosevelt I'm taking it I I liked that name for for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and I know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am at sea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounced would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big um oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect the with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to us was Saturday evening\nThat he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on\nWe have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really is around nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop\nA nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard sending the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put us any closer on that path\nOr we still kind of in a holding pattern me what is what's that looks\nLike well the Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or and love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea and the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rogue nuclear states and so I'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument as to why\nThe nuclear deal had to continue despite its imperfections and so um\nThe issue is is that um as far as violations to the actual and denuclearization goes\nThat is not something that's come up as an issue it consistently around has been found to be in compliance with those\nPromises of the nuclear agreement and so that's been a lot of the pushback to President Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement as if they're complying why would you do it so\nThe administration is sort of catered its policy\nTo instead really focused on destabilized Asian efforts that the Iranians are doing in the middle east are sending help to Syria sending a fighters to Yemen et cetera you know helping Hezbollah and Lebanon on all of these issues\nAre what the administration underscores as the reason that Iran needs to be kept in check is that if you clamp down on Iran and the funds that go into the coffers in Iran with the government uh you know getting rich and basically prospering off of this\nOn the Iranian or a revolutionary guard prospering off of this nuclear deal than Iran is just going to wreak havoc all over the middle east and so that's sort of the way that they've catered their argument to get around the actual nuclear issue\nGreg what happens next and this and the state of the treaty of and but he has apparently been torn up what what now\nWell that's been the big question the administration wants to put a lot of pressure on Iran is inflicting some real hurt to its economy its currency is falling through the floor as oil exports are already going down but", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
