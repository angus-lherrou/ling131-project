A. M. U. dot org\nLet's keep going with this investigation into the disappearance possible murder of ...\nCatherine wrote on our Facebook page putting denies Russia had anything\nSaudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that show was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of the various behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that [noise]\nYeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it\nAnd you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered and he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world part of that is about moral values\nWhen we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen how can we say that weren't uninvolved party\nUm you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled\nBut I kind of take Sonia point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it well\nThis was the let me ... me amplify that point just because it's absolutely critical\nYou know someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a center Ruben\nLindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press and much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of jihad isn't other extremist in Syria\nWe never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran\nWho has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of\nThe issue so basically the people who killed ... may get away with this then we may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or dress recognized coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot speak to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence with the Turks now have they've photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nOf the ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened to her well\nWe will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now\nHave flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given the course but there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight yesterday the Taliban killed at leaving police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed\nToday the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow\nThose elections will carry on his plan and the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least ten candidates and scores of voters\nIn the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election voter turnout the reliability of of the results what's the the kind of shovel\nUnfortunately every election in Afghanistan has been marred by violence so this is not unique but the ability of the Taliban to take out this really legendary police chief in Kandahar general Abdul Raziq and also his provincial intelligence chief is really stunning and it appears to have been an inside job\nI'm someone from his essentially his Guard Corps um you know it is it is striking that this happened he is someone who was very hard line against the Taliban who was a real ally for the United states and all these years\nUm you know going on Seventeen years now since the U.S has been involved over there\nAnd what is what was really you know sad\nOne of the things that's really sad about this\nIs that these parliamentary elections had already been to lay you have more than twenty five hundred candidates who are running on this sort of positive side\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at or do you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell like where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you were to bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have merely a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana what you do is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade it and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where the clause asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol in the ... give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of\nAnd then sort of pulled the TPP things ... said it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean Justin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move or a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level might meet for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggest\nPoint of being syllable and there are a long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out I Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nUh all over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and the use of happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see is part of the continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nIts issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana since two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim 'em by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M. J. Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith the story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out in India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching\nIndian waiting wondering when is it going to affect this culture where uh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nAh we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusation sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and us altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account and um it's\nIt's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nThe BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no I wouldn't want to know that the media and it turns out to making this they don't really\nKnow what to do this story goes up under the religion that's the only thing\nThat some of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in Carol estate outside the ... temple there in the ... I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this extraordinary pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says\nWell obviously that's not true let's I mean it's the most obvious part of that is that ... Modi who is the prime minister of India is from a fairly far right Hindu nationalist party so he's clearly not trying to destroy the culture and the religion\nThis is a historic Supreme Court ruling um that basically order that women should be allowed and have equal rights in this particular temple in ... you're talking about but it's not the first such\nA court decision that's actually the third case in India of court saying and the other two I think we're in my garage stressed state\nUm where Bombay as I'm saying that women had to be allowed into temples and this is not that I I Want to say this is not like\nA hugely widespread practice in India most temples at least in my experience traveling across India as a reporter uh most temples do allow women in um but there are you know some extremely conservative temples where they weren't and the court said no you can't do that because of equal rights\nThey told me to think it's really interesting just in the last few hours to more Bollywood director is wearing broiled in this so as Hayes was saying this is really spreading suddenly now in India but\nI think it's really stunning that women at the lower levels\nUm lower cast women poorer women rural women are not getting the benefit\nThat some of these you know prominent journalists or prominent women in Bollywood are getting um there's a huge problem in India of sexual violence and many of your listeners will remember several years ago the horrific case", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
