foreign twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had\nThere so uh ... dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of of free speech but when ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the\nThe Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name was ... maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive venture for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note notice that at that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying ah words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of a free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences than than there is sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protect it's so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nJacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate so online is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nThe line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given them a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and that's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's\nAnger but we've seen nothing like the white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes and so we\nYeah but I I I'm Sorry where am I going to do want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of talks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil\nOf anti Semitism and every fan of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nAmerican people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nNews accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role and all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira\nI'd well this was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nI'm going to be under the tree and we the people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we are not able to inform and educate citizens um about what's going on in their country if we are not able to hold\nPublicly elected officials accountable um then you don't have a true democracy and the president and miss understands what the term fake news means fake news actually means misinformation false stories that are made up\nWhether they are spread by Macedonia teenagers trying to get money for sneakers or Russian propaganda or American fake news factories where people can make tend to thirty thousand dollars a month\nOn advertising and penny clicks from people clicking on um salacious headlines that are completely made up he has taken that term and twisted it and appropriated to try to mean any news he doesn't like\nBut the issue here is that\nThe mainstream media by and large is accurate and true just because it may be reporting things that the president things are negative doesn't make them fake\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant ramps if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower except in on the left of people who have started with religious views and a close connection to the state of Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small school here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable about Yeah Bill that um\nYou know the express a strong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you or how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know announced they shut up that you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYet to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not\nThe not settle everything will David I'm going to be can be very hard to even let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs right but what do you make of Davis comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course that high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you know I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all that and very often it ... itself\nAs as attacks on Israel and Israel is right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism that Israel's policy is it anti Semitic which is not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nThat is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy as we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear it out where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a Jewish store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escaped and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind or wounds and set us on the path for making our town better endure would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favorable one of the things I think helped him this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked\nArms with one another that's right I mean scroll hill is a very this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet and a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and in Annapolis news written the capital Gazette so you know I I Do think we have to work\nA line between a hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least yielded any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do and after all this\nUm puns very upset and it's you know it's it's devastating of a family um friends and customers in there and that live in a squirrel hill it's um [noise] it we're taking a brutal hit\n[noise] um but like my comment is is that I I think that the ... I'm sure a lot of good for the polar polarization of the um ... the climate and the politics is\nIt's just gotten out of hand if we would just be more centralized do I have people who who are um left right friends and um but when we sit down and talk we mostly mostly come to agreement\nVery closely on our on our feelings and and our um how we feel about things and and the politics it's just too far left too far right and I think we were more centralized that a lot of the frustrations would be tamped down and wouldn't be so nearly so bad\nLee what do you find works with at least your friends in terms of getting to that place I feel like some folks just feel like they're too far apart and they just can't they just can't what has worked for you and your friends in terms of finding common ground how do you do that\nI'm ... ... ... you leave out the politics and discuss the um the topic um and and your viewpoints on the topics and when we discussed that we find that even though you know we we come back to very similar feelings on things\nAnd even though we vote differently but if it just just stick with the topics and not the politics around it\nThat's that's actually very good advice Lee thanks very much and thank you for calling in to talk to us we're hearing from several of you from the Pittsburgh area including Wendy who emailed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
