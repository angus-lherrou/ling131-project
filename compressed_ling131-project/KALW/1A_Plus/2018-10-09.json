A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one day Patrick Smith let me start with you\nGive us a quick overview of hula climbed McDonald an officer Van Dyke war over particularly officer Van Dyke and what his record was like within the police department before all of this happened\nWhile the climate Donald was a Seventeen year old um he had he had a difficult life before before the shooting he um\nHe was in the foster care here in Chicago a foster care system he was sort of in and out of juvenile jail but his friends describe him as a fun loving guy who was who was you know always sort of cracking jokes um and you know even though he was in the foster care system he he was mostly placed with family he grew up with his grandmother\nUm officer Van Dyke he joined the Chicago police department in two thousand one\nUm we got a chance to interview him before the trial started with our partners at the Tribune and and you know he said he believed he was a good officer he joined the force 'cause he wanted to help people\nHowever in his uh years on the force he racked up you know more than twenty citizen complaints against him most of those were not found to be true by the Chicago police department however they don't or they don't they side with the officer and most of the cases and we heard from experts who said that sheer number of citizen complaints\nMick rights I'm In North Carolina and the geo piece state super majority pushed to bill through last year to not release any body camera footage to the public\nI could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one be showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd assess wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nJust go do I Know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances ... what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago Graham case that basically said that\nWhen you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force it much basically take the in the faith that the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have done it in that\nSituation so it is not an object that is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find very few judgments\nFirst of all you know in in civil and suing police departments are jurors have to again how hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have done so\nIt is the Supreme Court that has set this world for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the keys is Graham versus conference of tastes from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on in officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like to do with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm they use deadly force in the new somehow justify\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military where they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon Spalding Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such a stern did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely dash law I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually in ... and ...\nAnd therefore I began an operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist or they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on with into ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement and my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drugs all of us though why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\n[noise] you know honestly a lot of police officers did approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on his police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and what was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there's this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them\nThey complied because they it ... it's easier it's easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to\nThey thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police coven ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easy podcast on the corner McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nWhat I Do I Do believe when some voters\nAnd we're certainly enters the interviews this change one thing and I want to remind everybody ran for billions of dollars every every every year in this case really took ... which is an unfortunate because I Am\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions in stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will doors Cordell because it's more of your comments before we start kind of looking for that were the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHe sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however down even had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nIs a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable misuse\nWe said well this is in the eye of the beholder\nIt really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers dating thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it that but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income communities\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in a community who knew everyone\nAnd they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth with\nTanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues why can't that come from within the humidity like Kent individuals' community members somehow be debt the ties to that deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim and somebody has to be searched gr do and I'm I'm not disagreeing with your just by way of topics there are some places where a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole\nImage we have of police being occupiers and look at a different\nWell justice reform but look what happened we may get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers so oh don't turn the Amazon or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so\nThat the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nIs fair and that'll sunshine and police say wait don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplining history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with a comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland left this in our inbox\nI talked to please both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know it's just that we\nWould rather have conflict wave or with community\nRather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nYou know take away the first couple of months but at least to buy the it's added a community\nWithout guns make them stand up comedian to force me to have a dialogue with me I think it'd be a lot better\nUh which certainly a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict them but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was a veggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cornell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you have those relationships but when you have this occupying force were you know none of the people who are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict when the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform river community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever\nWith the community decides what's important were the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions as political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community to side and they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to\nMeans that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including a larger scale Jamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments\nThey could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into what's going to these photos with this dance to police forces not your friend even if you're a regular law abiding citizen so maybe trainings part of it\nAnd Hector emailed the u._k. and other European Union countries have unarmed on duty police officers and we should have more on armed cops to\nPatrick Smith I'm not sure if anyone is advocating that any officer than Chicago disarmed themselves but I Wonder what people are suggesting I mean is there a conversation about lasting change after the ... McDonald's case or are there still other loose ends with this that need to be tied up first before we talked about before\nWell there are I mean the uh the video of a crime McDonald's shooting a prompted the department of justice to come in and investigate the the Chicago police department which has been done in other cities\nAnd actually um our state governments and the city of Chicago are are in a very a final moments of sort of hammering out a consent decree to make big changes over the next you know decade to the Chicago police department um the police union here is very opposed to that effort they think that this reform\nOr is not going to help it's gonna make us less safe\nMany activists think this is a a a really good you know a really big step and then of course there are some who are who are skeptical of this is going to be the change\nThat we really mean and I will say one thing that has been talked about a lot here that that some of the comments you've gotten\nA ... have alluded to is is the idea of having\nUm officers in neighborhoods that they really know or something that I've heard from a lot of people is that there are\nWhite officers you know Chicago is a very segregated city that there are white officers who really didn't have much ... interaction with people of color before they joined the force and then they are sort of dropped first thing for you know as soon as they are out of the academy into some of the toughest neighborhoods in the city where they are", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "09"}
