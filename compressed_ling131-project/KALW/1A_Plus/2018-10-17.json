A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nHere's another one that's not getting that much attention proposition twelve bigger cages for farm animals and California we tend to get a fair amount of propositions that would affect animals [laughter] what what what this one too\nYeah so this is ... days however the voters voted on a similar measure in two thousand a thought was proposition to and this was sort of in a way to double down on that this would place specific size requirements on chicken coops and cages are used to compete in pigs cows\nAre on on farms in California I'm In actually require\nIt it'd be applied to any of food or or animal products sold within California so in fact this would be barred not just to California farmers with farmers across the country who want to so or ... or ... in California\nUm and so this would uh you know the specific dimensions it'd be you know\nOne square foot of of floor space for free Chen by twenty twenty and then cage free by twenty twenty two or another you know specific size requirements for for a pigs cows as well so the back story here is that she does it in the states are voters passed proposition too\nAnd that was a similar initiative which required that the farm animals um be allowed to to stand up and move around and turn around or rather and in their cages I'm an actor that path or a number of commercial and farmers argues that that does not actually require them to go and\nI suppose you could start clarifying that point on by saying no in fact by twenty twenty two ah clearly written into this proposition cage to you have to go cage free um for for egg farmers um the debate around this is really a kind of interesting because the\nThe proponents of this and that the the folks who wrote this proposition with the humane society humane society even the United states and they actually got them buy in from\nUh some groups within a California agriculture is the Central Valley eggs for example they also got the support of the California Democratic party um and and the anti side of the people who who are against proposition ... well it's a it's\nA pretty weird coalition on the one hand you have sort of\nPredictable arguments that it would raise the cost of doing business in California or raise the price of of food um and so you have that argument from the California Republican Party from\nUm a lot of agricultural interests but you also have the opposition from\nPita and from the humane farming association in these other um animal rights groups or who argue that no in fact you know we the California voters and two thousand they said we want to go cage free and that's that's the rule and and so we shouldn't give farmers additional time\nAh to to meet that requirement for twenty twenty two so so the politics of this or a little bit confusing\nAnd some animal groups also say that this at the end of the day this I mean it might be a bigger cage but the animal and this will be killed anyway and so they say it's kind of a false it's ... it kinda paints a false picture asked to citizens about how adults are treated\nSure that that that's absolutely right maybe on the day we're talking about or cows and pigs are being\nRead for for slaughter so so if you're opposed to that are across the board than than certainly um this is and this is not going to this is not even a half measure um but you know in the past you have animal groups like Peter who have who have been on board\nUm ah with these kind of more incremental steps but but this I I Believe it was a they consider to incremental\nWright city yes on Trump's side has raised almost wow ten million dollars three million from the open philanthropy action fund the humane society just more than two million a couple of individuals at the humane league Marcy for animals they've already some money on this\nThe no side has raised five hundred and sixty six thousand dollars and that has all come from the humane farming action fund\nRight and again those are a animal rights activists ... so it is kind of interesting that even though you have opposition from from big agricultural groups again the than the bulk of the money\nIs coming from animal rights groups which you wouldn't necessarily expect given that this is being um but you know branded as a as a animal rights initiative\nRight okay so that one is from\nTwelve that's twelfth yes and we made a mistake we sent eleven pups there's actually twelve props\nAnd well no actually there are a lot I live in its its top official one through twelve but nine of missing a oh voters\nMy uh find that confusing but there was initially a a a measure and some people might remember lists that I'm Around a proposal to divide the fate into three parts we're gonna have three California and that was ... nine\nOr ... or a court ruled that the no actually of voters can't use the the ballot measure to destroy the state of California [laughter] so that was taken off\nWe have other important things to do it on [laughter] well All right so now the one that's not getting much attention but it's very important is proposition eight dialysis clinic profit printing\nA a hashing it out through the ballot initiative process so on paper what this would do is that this would require companies that operate a dialysis clinic or throughout California\nTo uh to effectively um kept their profits at at a profit margins that Fifteen Percent of of their business costs are above their business costs\nAnd so uh any payments that are that they receive a above that profit margin they'd have to pay back to insurance companies or her or individual to pay for dialysis treatment so I'm effectively as it it it's a profit cap for fees for this industry\nThe back story here is that um the vast majority of the houses in California are owned by a to a for profit company there's the veto a kidney care than present his medical care\nAnd for years the um\nThe service Employees International union in the United healthcare workers the union that represents a lot of health care workers and California have um been trying to to unionize this the workers with them as industry they sponsored\nLegislation they floated other ballot measures as well to to to require higher staffing ratios\nAnd so this is sort of the latest um ... I mean their argument is that the um these companies are um have a giant market share and so as a result they're able to cut corners of the expense of of a patient care\nSo their argument is pretty straightforward but you know these companies are extremely profitable and they need to make sure that that they're not putting profit several of quality of care and the sort of force them more to invest more in equipment and training and in a ploy use\nMushroom from from the federal government or even more importantly a it would be potentially quite inconvenient I mean obviously reset her car who over inconvenient but there were times where they can be in the California with what we were there for a\nTime schedule from the ... maker things a little bit\nComplicated for for trade or communication and then there's the question of you know do we want to have a situation where winter uh folks were getting up in the dark and and kids are going to school and and you know going to school when it's still you know as far out of ... I'm an for those of safety concerns well all\nRight and said the groups for at California Democratic party Republican Party Green Party and friends committee on legislation of California\nBen I Know we have to let you go and I just want to say thank you so much to you and everybody account matters because you all have done excellent work on this election and you did a great job of explaining these proposition ... thank you for your time and thanks for your work\nOff by ... by from\nChristopher is covering the twenty Eighteen election season for ... matters a nonprofit journalism venture committed to explaining how California state Capitol works and why it matters they do really great work I Hope you can check out to count matters and also if you want more information on props KLW news cross currents\nIs doing a a ... on the website ... yet KLW dot org you can find their explanations also of the propositions what it means if you vote yes what it means if you vote no and those are election briefs\nNow we're going to switch gears and follow the money the amount of money raised for the midterms has already surpassed three point nine billion dollars which is another record and voters across the country will decide on the future of the U.S Congress\nCalifornia plays a very significant role in shaping control of the house\nAccording to Rolling Stone California is home to ten or more swing seats nearly half of the twenty three that Democrats need to recapture the house in November\nJoining us to talk about money and politics in California is Daniel Newman president of map light and nonprofit that reveals the influence of money in politics Hi Danielle welcome to the show\nThank you it's great to be here well I Want to thank you also because voters edge dot org the ballot guy that you put together with the league of women voters has really it's just amazing I think we use it on every single show so thanks for all the work that you're doing there\nIt's our pleasure and I'm as or your listeners may know you go to voters that shut or you type in your street address and it tells you who's on your ballot even down to the local level the city council school board and judges as well\nAnd it's a fantastic and information and you know Daniel the way that things are these days unfortunately as you just have to follow the money with everything and in some cases that can really determined the way you vote I mean I'm so glad we did the show today because I just didn't know that the proper eight dialysis prop\nI mean the no side has spent over a hundred million dollars do you know is this a record for balance in California\nUm it's not a rock in some but it is a ... a very high one and we we see that here you have an interest of the kidney dialysis providers would be limited in fees and they're gonna they're spending an enormous amount of money to try and block the measure\nAnd is there anything else stand out for you it just in terms of how much money's being spent on the propositions\nThink the really the prop ten which is the one that would allow local cities do have their own rent control laws um is is a really a a large money one also be due to the financial interests are on the yes side you've got twenty million dollars I'm so far with the largest funder being age health aides healthcare\nSixty million from realtors and property developers who obviously are opposed to uh rent control laws\nRight at the numbers have gone up since we did a show a couple of weeks ago again ... ten would repeal Costa Hawkins and allow local governments to implement rent control laws so as you said the yes side the group that wants to repeal Costa Hawkins for more rent control\nHas spent about twenty million the no side almost sixty million and California association of realtors is at the top with five million Blackstone property partners they bought a ton of housing after the two thousand eight crash five million western national\nGroup another five million so there's a lot at stake on ... on this one in so many others\nThere isn't that great guy that this the government send you in the mail that explains the propositions\nOr unfortunately doesn't have the up to date or any money information and so sites like voters edge and others will have that and I found that the these propositions obviously there's so much to learn and going to the voters that China and looking at the money in favor and oppose can I can really shortcut voter decision\nMaking and have you decide who who who thought are you on basically in terms of his supporters and opponents on the funding side\nAnd ... also unveiled another great tool to track money and politics the California political money tracker tell us about this project and what we can find out about individual candidates\nYes so on the the you go to the map lake out or exciting can see the\nPolitical money tracker and it shows you or you can look up a any candidate that you want that is running for state office so do you look up a Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of course\nAnd you can see his support are right now totally forty throughout wrote forty three million dollars and one of the neat things about the tools that puts together the money that's given to\nNuisance campaign and also the people spending what's called independent expenditures which basically means unlimited money and supported him and his his opponent in the primary opponent John Cox\nA raise about Eighteen million dollars so\nFar and I'm just searching for Gavin Newsom to come up with some names here what oh this is interesting to support for new some is forty two million opposition to new some Seventeen million\nTop contributors a California Democratic party a hundred and twenty thousand dollars green spoon a lot of these things I've never heard of United Health group United food and commercial workers\nAnd so you've got that and then you see the top independent spenders which is really important\nExactly for the independent spending is really the unlimited spending so you have groups and individuals that can spend an unlimited amount and support or opposition to a candidate and those are really I'm driving a lot of races right now in Congress as well as the state\nAnd the top independent spender for Gavin Newsom as citizens supporting new some sponsored by labor organizations and Blue Shield of California five million dollars\nRight so we're labor and health insurance group and then you can go in and and type in the name of that group in the state website and and drill down further if you want to [noise]\nWhat strikes you about some of them house races in California and how much money Republicans and Democrats are raising\nWell so I Would not have an exact figures in hand it's really the competitive races obviously Dr most of the spending and most of the fundraising and and the um what what's really a difference in the last eight years since the horrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision\nThat you have corporations and individuals are spending unlimited amounts to um to influence politics and and it's especially problematic in the so called dark money groups which is groups that don't have to disclose their donors and have been a big factor in all the um\nPlay in California nearly half of the twenty three that Democrats need to recapture the house in November and according to the LA Times and the top seven most competitive house races in California Democratic candidates raised as staggering Twenty one point six million dollars\nOver the last three months by comparison Republicans running for the seats took in four point two million that's a huge difference\nIt is and and I think um you know even though these these numbers are large is really hard to get a sense of what they actually mean\nI mean a elections are really inexpensive compared to how important they are for people I mean we're going to spend as a country a much more on Halloween and we are going to spend on the federal elections this year\nAnd cheese [laughter] that Daniel when you look at the money I mean at the federal level according to uh open secrets we've already hit about three billion dollars just for the midterms which is at a record\nAnd you know a lot of people actually I'm Sorry three point nine billion and people are really just tired of the amount of money that's being spent on election so\nThe real issue is is not so much the money being spent I think where it comes from and right now overwhelmingly corporations and very rich people are providing most of the money or unions also contribute but there are a modest factor compared to the the um the the very rich people computer into superPACs and the\nCorporate donations notes that ... what's needed is a public funding a lack of elections are voter owned elections and so in Berkeley for example ah the um voters last year rebounding in twenty sixteen resoundingly passed\nA matching funds program so now if your candidate for office in Berkeley and you opt into this a public funding system\nIf you decide to limit your ...\nYour campaign contributions to only fifty dollars than every dollar you raise is matched with another six dollars from the city fun and so what this means is that you don't have to depend on special interests you don't have to spend your time calling people on the phone asking for big donations you can go door to door you can have grassroots event", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",
