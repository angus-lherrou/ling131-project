as senators debated whether Brett Kavanaugh was right for the job\nKavanaugh is confirmed by a vote of fifty to forty eight the closest vote in more than a hundred and Thirty years\nHe was sworn in hours after the vote but it's ceremonial swearing in takes place this evening at the White House\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have energized Americans on all sides and the midterms are less than a month

a one a comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org today is one of those kind of got checked days where we just want to check and see where people's heads rat answer questions dispel misconceptions\nBut maybe the first place to start is like where are we now it feels like this has been America's one big story for weeks now a Elliana Johnston what's your sense of just kind of where we are right\n[noise] well I think that cabin not\nNomination and now confirmation will have some at lasting effects and I think as we\nGet further away from it it's sort of easier to see it with clarity at the first\nIs that that you did show a confirmations are getting more polarized on John Roberts was confirmed Seventy\nEight to twenty two Alito fifty eight forty two courses\nEight so these votes are becoming narrower and they're occurring more along partisan lines and I think that will continue particularly as the prospect of a Republican president\nUp potentially replacing a justice who was ... I put on the court by a Democratic president comes up the next justice to go is likely to be a liberal they they are older\nUm and the second is sort of the opening of a places previously considered not open to scrutiny the high school and college years of\nNot just a judicial nominees but perhaps cabinet secretaries and political candidates\nI'm to scrutiny at ... I was one of the first or maybe the first to have his high school years are open to public scrutiny and something that almost derailed his confirmation I think that's a trend likely to continue today we saw CNN reporter under fire for tweets\nThat she sent in college and she had to apologize for those so I think those are the two trends that we're likely see continue and the cabinet confirmation really set a precedent for them\nInteresting you bring up the cabinet the kind of get into that Senate rule of advice and consent with federal judges and cabinet positions and so you're kind of opens the door for more political situation in the future you know stepping where'd you see this where are we right now\nWe'd love to hear from you to comment on our Facebook page tweet us at one a email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org and we're always checking or phone voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one a this has not been quite a few weeks including here in D.C\nWHM used Patrick Madden was there on Saturday as hundreds of people protested on the Capitol Steps\nKind of reflects when we heard from ... in North Florida who tweeted\nWe better vote like our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme Court if we can possibly help it\nSharon emailed I was behind judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed but he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn brought on our Facebook page you can't soft sell this anymore which unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the white didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks much and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment but evident cheery question of whether they should have should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court for or you know ... like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed\nOthers what did you make of that\n[noise] so this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um both parties in Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nOf sexual assaults us and take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and to and to the president himself and so forth so that's their view on the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing forward one was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test um the the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in but says to Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to the students in that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks and girls with clay lose and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it so um\nSo so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with lazy Ford's more\nUm believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an Audi a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nThe president did also make some political hay with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well\nIn Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president kind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to say\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember when I was trying to remember how many I don't want to I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] I don't I don't know what I mean that's the only thing [noise]\n\nI don't mind my Saturdays a man lies just shattered\nPart of what the president said at his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor for to remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hip boot camp is clearly a psychology professor\nWas the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things that President did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking her and diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people uh from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of a absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that uh the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh would seem to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of the nation from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes ... on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather first moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the way ... [noise]\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in cabin up in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nLousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of\nTheir their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about\nTemperament and did he had the appropriate temperament sit on the bench\nAnd it ah their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that are Democrats had said he was to block they in the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they that that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective and that the temperament question was an\nOne to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar\nOh all of their politics are based on the president to a point that it's based on the way they ruled so ah the temperament question was interesting I'm not sure how relevant it is because we know all the politics of all of the justices not really sure how cabinets temperament plays into\nIt with regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One\nThomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one there's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have some support from both sides you know what do you make a simple Thomas\nDid not require sixty votes confirmed but\nShe did not ...\nNot that we never required sixty votes to confirm um he may have required sixty votes to proceed to the vote ... Clarence Thomas did not get sixty votes\nSo you're talking you're talking about the ... to ... suspend debate on the nomination exactly for what's called culture that and then move on certainly\nWe saw that question come up here where\nLisa Murkowski and others voted for cloture and there was a question as to whether their vote would stay the same\nWhether it will reflect what exactly will during ... and her and we\nSaw that with McCain also in in the health care vote round where he voted to proceed but then voted against ... um but\nI mean that's not the norm now not requiring the sixty votes for culture for Supreme Court nominees I mean that's one of the things are actually a wreck happened on his testimony said anything in a different context right what goes around comes around and politics a that was something that Democrats put in place\nUm and now it's difficult to drop the or the number of votes for for cloture and including for for cabinet nominees in particular that's allowed the Republican Senate taken from most of Donald Trump's cabinet picks a in a way that they would not have with a prior rules\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a where you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file let's keep up to date on future topics will share some of your stories tomorrow\nOn one day back now to our conversation with you know step in LA on a Johnson and motive sharing you know let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comic before we could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice\nWorth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business or your ah but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness it was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that know what I mentioned right the idea that single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized ...\nThere's no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\n... emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time when one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood\nBoils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nStarted when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one in four than America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein into shearing said that according to federal statistics is one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a\nYet or not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against your will ... should be careful with the number yeah okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of\nMale sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera so\nIt is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of\nFinding a guilt a finding someone guilty of rape mean years and years and years in prison\nAnd so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nLike this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this\nBeen waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear you Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics early on I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised and it was should he at\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should I had the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that I mentioned face a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should know that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was\nVery high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of a reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox my name is art\nI'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nAnd our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time Dan an African American woman I really do feel that it was all of the joke that they went behind doors and say okay let's get the country a good show they already know what\nThey were going to do it's not a government either oh oh Oh yes it is only up to take care of a group of people\nFor pre shirts calling and sharing your thoughts with us when we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that it's absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court her life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined\nThe me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kevin uh really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with\nPresidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will\nDrag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nLook I'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift\nJered than some art cleaning um I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states\nI'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester is I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I Do think that she's in Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was asked a judge on the court he was following Supreme Court\nA precedent his job as a judge was tried to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now that he is setting that President he's played a role in what he thinks that precedent should be\nUm I I Do think um something that's under covered we we may now have I don't think that we have the votes on the Supreme Court to overturn roe versus Wade I Do think that we have the votes on the court potentially can narrow something called a Chevron precedent\nUm that grants federal agencies incredible latitude that grants them um a lot of lot of heat from the courts to interpret the statues that they are down regulating on so I think\nIn terms of agency power regulatory power the administrative state not as sexy a topic I Know uh but I\nDon't think I'm sure it is yeah I\n... I think it's an incredibly important issue so I I was excited as a conservative um to hear that Brett Kavanaugh is quite strong on this issue and he has a very strong record on on the D.C court of appeals on this issue\nOr what was your clips from one of our listeners too concerned about the future of the Supreme Court as a result of this process ... she left in our inbox\nThis is Jane outcome Thomas move will Kentucky and I feel this is a sad day for America\nThe Republicans and Mitch McConnell has made our Supreme Court into a political institution and not the fair just just judicial court that is designed to be\nDriven appreciate your calling and thanks for talking to us I Wonder are we ought to what you make of dreams comment or heard what you said earlier in terms of these votes confirmation votes getting narrower and narrower but you know spring court has always been something of a political football to varying degrees basically throughout American history [noise]", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "08"}
