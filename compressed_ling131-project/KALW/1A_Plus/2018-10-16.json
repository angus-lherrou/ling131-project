I'm not denying climate change\nBut it could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just said with Michael says that they say when they say that and and but what about ... scientists who say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence\nOr maybe because of that evidence I mean think about it if someone tried to hit you over the head with a bunch of facts and figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong how would you feel\nOr if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the facts being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument\nWhat would that be like we want to elevate this debate\nTo change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what is it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours\nWhat's worked and what has not\nIs one a at W. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one egg\nJoining us from K. U. L. W. public radio in Seattle is Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington shield a PHD in ecology from UC Davis she also founded the row in Institute a group that empowers leaders to tackle climate change Sarah welcome to want to say\nThanks for having me joining us from NPR in New York is poll Bledsoe a lecturer at American University's Center for environmental policy American owns W. A. M. U. the station that produces one a\nAnd the strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome\nThanks structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just framed a discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is bigger than just is climate change real this kind of feels to me like the human aspect of working our way through this issue right\nYeah I definitely this is something that impacts all of the political a decision making aspects of our public life right now how we're integrating science and how were you how we're essentially distorting science across this partisan divide that Israeli characterizing this political moment in our nation right now\nNow we heard from President Trump and that sixty minutes interview momentarily just a few minutes ago on that note John left us this note in our inbox\nMy question really is why why does the president insist on\nDenying that climate change is fact and that global warming is something that we have to contend with that a nation as a nation and would require you know in Manhattan Project or an Apollo program level of effort to try to them what's coming in the next twelve\nYears if we do nothing so that's my question and who's advise him on climate science and why is he being so adamantly ignorant about the problem\nAre you having with people in your life about climate change have you been able to win any one over have you had any arguments that just went sideways tell us what this conversation it's been like for you\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change\nFor what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm\nFor my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nRural routes or Okrent wrote that than I Am an offering and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and\nTeaching about climate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I have had that climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just outdoor comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate Katie emailed\nMy family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much\nHe won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to this\n[noise] like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nAnd I anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions ... into our partisan corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSure if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change which we discussed last week on this program and not feel like well\nWe're all going to die anyway why bother run up your\nCredit 'cause they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that\nWe're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us and specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strength and our resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead but oh I Would just add that the St\nLouis in Missouri reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the could golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon\nIf we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate we can limit near term warming and prevent run away of climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it\nExactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really\nJust to be against that a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are harder floor carbon sir manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration huh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush\nA Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nI didn't realize it HFCs these are some of the the refrigerant chemicals that kind of kind of safe and the heat out of a refrigerator and help it than to actually go back to the rise and there's three thousand\nTimes more powerful PR molecule been CEO to incredibly powerful chemicals\nAnd if we keep using them if we had kept using them we would have raised temperatures more than a degree Fahrenheit by twenty fifty now that we're phasing it out we're preventing that warming we can do this\nLet's talk about that that one degree to degree three degrees thinks they're a cause that also came up with a number of comments we've gotten and the number of degrees that the earth's average temperature increases\nIs a key part of the latest report from the un Ron emailed I'd like to hear the scientists talk more about the likelihood of the world reaching higher temperatures in two degrees centigrade for example\nI've heard that if we reached two degrees centigrade and the likelihood of reaching three or four degrees higher becomes greater and greater what would the world looked like not at two degrees centigrade but three four five or six degrees hotter Sarah give us a sense of where you think of that\nNative American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life\nWhat did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blitz so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on\nNoel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess let's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean right\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to\nThat well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal thing\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise] yes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the the\nThe day that the and the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why and people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for our planet has been ... authorizations between glacial in inter glacial state abrupt warming into into glacial\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial state so that pacing of glacial into glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun Sarah backup\nOranges along and they're changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial state last me it's so cool it's amazing like always confusing like like bring it down to earth from me\nOkay so in the last million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American\nAnd you're Asian continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in inter glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this I'm off ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you this yeah this heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we hold too warm cold today warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it\nTo us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes for a pattern\nThat's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying earlier on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever\nThat will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nSo former climate advisor for the Clinton White house professorial lecture at American University Center for environmental policy at a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much\nAssociate at the University of Washington and founder of the ruins Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get in the way of us finding agreement and compromises we just discussed\nBut we're not alone no matter how fraud things may become sheer between now and the midterms at least we're not trying to work out a divorced that's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nAt stake a claim on these negotiations are necessarily\nBut the reason is because it affects the future of our country is that John and I think in every community is kind of country the all time off in a democracy\nI continue to believe that a negotiated deal without the u._k. and for the European Union continues to believe it's up to them is achievable I'm not much I Will continue to where it was all European hot and I commend this statement [noise] tomorrow\nBritain's prime minister Theresa May will face European Union leaders in what has been called a make or break summit this week the president of the European Council ... to ... the u._k. is barreling towards a disastrous no deal Brexit Britain's exit from the ... you\nKnow these are tough times for the Brits so it's no wonder they look for some good news elsewhere anywhere and not for the first time it was news from the royal family that came to the rescue\nThe duchess of Sussex Megan Marco and Prince Harry will make royal history their baby will be seven in line to the throne and\nIt will be one of the first acknowledged heirs of mixed race in the royal family we should note queen Charlotte back in the Eighteen hundreds was believed to be of mixed race and she went on to have Fifteen children ...\nJoining us from Brooklyn is Christian mine's ... the director of nonfiction programming at the podcast network ... she co hosted the podcast when Megan ...
