A. M. U. dot org and we're taking your calls and voice mails at eight five five to three six one a one a speaking of calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line Hey David what's on your mind\nHey Joshua how are you good what'd you think could be a hearing last week\nThat's a ... exactly what I Would comment on I feel that uh I'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made a public because it allows us\nAs a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington worth of our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on in regard less of a or political or aspirations uh I myself\nHave a they also at the alcoholism in my past ah I found a recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to uh he was able to hide a my drinking and justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that uh they do not have a problem so um I think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects\nThe future of all of us David how ... how do you think is\nHow do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations that need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nA ... one particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the Senate session was questioning him about a an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was open to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife\nOr her response to him because when he was not answering that question was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly\nWas she thinking when he refused to answer this question regarding an FBI investigations yeah your your your that\nYour friend that I watched enough that senator ... Illinois puts of rights have enough\nAnd there's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYeah David appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired in Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bringing our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party I'm off\nBecause they are to some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but I think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful just as well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll\nGet beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nWithout another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth wide drove the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law for a think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth welcome great to be with you let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how well that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw judge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request that Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain game like she\nCame up with this decades long con to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nWonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there have emailed the Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but\nThat would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be overhauled well I think that most people\nThe lower courts and the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nWell let's first talk about Dr Ford and her very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court I think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold him criminally liable\nSo it isn't a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of thing it said let's try to get all the facts which is what the FBI investigation shouldn't be doing and I think we'll get to that as soon\nAnd and then decide whether or not this is someone among other possible candidates who should be elevated to the Supreme Court and I think a lot of people would say if there's any doubt for the integrity of the Supreme Court\nThen you should vote no and it doesn't mean you think he should be locked up in jail forever endeavor um but it does mean that perhaps he should not be elevated to the Supreme Court\nYeah ... Jeffrey Rosen I Want to ask you about that in terms of the nature of what we might find from the FBI and what we do with that a number of folks have been asking about the evidence Sherry standard as it relates to whatever happens after the investigation\nLarry tweeted and important take away is the way the Republicans successfully changed the standard by which they judge how they view Dr Ford delegations from meeting merely a credible belief that it could have happened to be swayed to a criminal trials beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd commit to vote tweeted what if the accusations by Ford and others are corroborated but a criminal prosecutorial standard cannot be met since this isn't a court of law what would actually affect this nomination\nTell us your story you can email us one a ass W.

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about or emails involving lower court confirmations which rebel and support programs and the evidence tested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho's your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school\nWe have been her Pamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this for across the country\nAnd even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat the suit and tie to decide the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not at the partisan tones the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happened here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember\nOur conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do which is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward I Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means\nFor just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling this\nWell after last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken part is and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame is the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats\nFor retaliated um with this nominee a and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWorks better we're going to have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity to our judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement\nIf presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process and it would become more\nI'm sane [laughter] um and law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices yeah time\nYou have ... I've I've I've heard I was I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically if you would come open kind of like clockwork that this might not be quite so much like\nOh we're making this decision that will look like our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable\nI Wonder if that just depends on whether we American people are willing to pound the table and demand it until the law changes it's not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but what what are you yeah I mean I think that's\nProposal for the particular Senate ah right now um but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because\nI think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh's being a case of quote unquote retaliation from the Democrats you know there are a lot of issues with this particular nomination I'm In addition to the fact that he would be taking over Anthony Kennedy's\nSeat on the Supreme Court Kennedy being the vote that basically has preserved meaningful access to abortion preserved major civil rights and protections and so on and so on you know\nThere's also wrote a decision in the ... the marriage equality was protected by the costumes right\nWe are talking marriage equality we're talking about housing discrimination we're talking about affirmative action and we're talking about environmental protections I mean this is a huge nomination\nBut this particular nominee comes with a lot of issues you know my organization constitutional accountability center\nOpposed him after the hearing based on his record because we looked carefully at his cases and saw that his views of individual rights did not square with the text history and values of the constitution his views on frankly extreme conservative views on the way that the government should work\nUm are are we think again out of step with the constitution and\nAnd then there are people who raised the you know a credibility issues as a Professor Rosen was just discussing\nUm and then of course now we come to the doctor Ford and others are making allegations against him so you know I think we're very entrenched in this current moment and we should be um but there's been a lot going on in this nomination leading up to this point that isn't just about\nPartisan politics it's about what impact this particular nominee will have on the Supreme Court\nAnd with regards to the way that we choose Supreme Court nominees Joseph emailed part of the problem with the Kavanaugh nomination is the fact that Republicans lowered the bar for Supreme Court confirmations to a simple majority had the previous two thirds majority brings fill in the ... President Trump would have had to nominate a more moderate conservative\nI'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one hey", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
