then twenty twelve Castro became the first Latino to give the keynote address at the Democratic national convention\nNow Castro is forty four still pretty young looking and contemplating a run for

Texas by a single mother and an immigrant grandmother\nThe book is called an unlikely journey waking up from my American Dream and he joins us now in Studio secretary Leon Castro welcome to one day it's great to be with you will be speaking to him for the first part of our program before we move on and talk Saudi Arabia so if you have questions or thoughts\nThat you'd like to share it with secretary Castro we'd love to hear them email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a\n... tell me about the title of the book first of all waking up from my American Dream what do you mean by that\nWell you know this is a memoir and so it's really the story of my family's time in the United states and it starts with a my grandmother or whose name was a Victoria who came over with her younger sister from Mexico and Nineteen twenty two because for parents who died and her nearest relatives lived in San Antonio\nA and the subtitle waking up or my American Dream is really about each generation of my family\nI'm kind of confronting and figuring out that to make the American dream real not only do you have to work hard as individuals and a family but really that you had to do something broader than that but you had to try and push\nYour community and the country to get better so in my grandmother's case you know she came into a Texas where she would still see signs in storefronts that said no negroes no dogs or Mexicans allowed\nA my mother ah\nKnow was the first in her family to graduate from high school and then go on to college she got very active or as a student or in the old she'd gone a movement the Mexican American civil rights movement to the late Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies uh and so she tried to improve her community\nEggs full bore and uh we've tried in public service to make sure that other folks could have the kind of opportunity that we had gone to the public schools there in San Antonio and then getting to go to college and you go to law school to become professionals and reach our American Dream and I think that message of of waking up\nI'm is something that I Hope uh a lot of young people will take to heart today because if there if there's ever a time where we need to push back\nAgainst folks and forces who are trying to take us back word it is today\nWhy did why am I appreciate you saying that I didn't want to clarify the subtitles so that it didn't sound like you were saying that the American dream was some fantastical thing that we need it as a wake up from and kind of a cynical way you talking about in your writing the book about kind of\nParticularly your mother and her advocacy at the birth of the ... kind of movement how much work went into kind of making this American Dream real or or more real yeah\nI mean you know I I think about uh the generations whose shoulders we stand on and uh in in so many different ways whether it was marching in the streets picketing I'm obviously fighting for the franchise and then actually going to vote in organizing people running for office\nWhat can one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\nNo thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to ...\nFor decades um\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nThe problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity\nIn their community and I'm very proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who were able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is Huck doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know secretary bank are yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that as a four to ... to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also to work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly with China\nAre but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that impacting our producers negatively\nThat's Mike ... the secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture is you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are are some of them okay with the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here uh you know I think a lot of folks\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way\nIn this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by a while the president has done this\nOr David Young is another good example up there and so I heard a disappointment\nWith the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic\nWhen it comes to China now my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states as possible [noise] we've seen some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics of warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from a perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost icy immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade\nAnd leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say to those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise] uh what I say is that number one I'm\nKnow we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nUnderstanding the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting their\n... and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deal\nTrump Administration is any kind of a of thoughtful plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of your story is obviously an immigrant story so I Want to ask you about immigration policy particularly because of the significant enthusiasm that Trump supporters have for his stance on immigration even if not on all of his policies you right in the book\nAbout the difficulties you and other Latino families experience kind of struggling families you work with poor Americans homeless Americans while you were HUD secretary give me a sense of what\nDemocrats should be saying to Republicans too conservative to moderates who lean toward President Trump about immigration especially in light of the concerns over one immigration means to us what should Democrats be saying\nWhat folks I think or whichever party there they're part of war they're independent um\nYou know to understand is that the vast vast majority of immigrants in this country are are law abiding\nAre good people who have made their community stronger\nAnd that on balance immigration not just now but throughout the history of this country has contributed tremendously to its forward progress and the messages that we can both have a sensible immigration policy\nOr that continues to allow folks to come to the United states um improve our legal process and also a humanely deal with the ten or eleven million people who are here who are undocumented and also have\nTo three six one a one way or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our

A. M. U. dot for\nCarrying house let me start with you as we said secretary Pompeo is heading to Saudi Arabia today many people around the world are up in arms over this is it fair to call this an international crisis particularly a crisis for the Trump Administration\n[noise] I wouldn't use the word crisis but it's clearly a problem for the Trump Administration and an even bigger problem for the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nNow it's evident I'm Sorry go ahead Ken\nWhat he has been seen by including by me I Confess as a a\nEconomic and social or former I I understood from the beginning he was not a Democrat he had no intention of reforming the\nMonarchy hit the boy a death as with Mikhail Gorbachev efforts to reform the Soviet Union does or does save the\nCommunists and this is to save the whales so monarchy [noise] so it wasn't about democracy but I Am shocked that he could do something that is so short sighted for the goal of ultimately reforming the Saudi economy which\nIs not done well coached them at least think the monarchy because they are not going to be able to look forward cradle to grave lives for a growing number of ...\nRight and just to be clear she you're referring to his Mohammed bin some on the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who is now are in charge in power now it is evident that the issue of arms sales to the Saudis is very much on the mind of President Trump's Sarah Leah Whitson let's listen to\nYou're on sixty minutes between President Trump unless we stole about what actions America might take and he's speaking in the context of that arms deal was\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China water that we wanted it we got it and we got all of it every bit of it so would you cut that off ... well what I don't want to do Boeing Lockheed\nRaphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs tell everybody what's at stake here you know that well there's a lot of ... there's a lot at stake and\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going to have to see\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nPresident Trump speaking to us we stole in an interview that aired last night on sixty minutes Sarah what do you make of that\n[noise] um well I think it's definitely an indication that President Trump is trying to appear to be taking this more seriously\nUh initially I think uh he and others were hoping they could sweep this under the rug with a lot of if then you still hear hear the if then language a in a President Trump's remarks but there's also a promise of a severe punishment um which is interesting and important\nI think the other piece of this that is distressing and interesting is that while every single American administration has sold weapons to a tyrannical abusive governments are like Saudi Arabia\nUm there was also a little bit of embarrassment about it it was something that ah wasn't boosted about\nAnd uh there were sort of measures of condition analogy that would be attached\nI think President Trump is the first president that is just clearly naked leaf saying I'm that well this is about dollars and uh it doesn't really matter what the other side does we're never going to sacrifice her dollars for it I'm ... and I think it's it's\nMaybe it's a good thing to expose the harsh reality of of what us arms sales are really all about 'em but I think it will also make people very very uncomfortable or to recognize that it's a value free transaction that that the U.S government the purports\nTo stand for certain values actually doesn't care about them if it means a enriching blockades in the ... of this world\nYou're let's clarify what some of the\nLuxury though of it being about defense if you will and not dollars during the Cold War period and that is gone so it is more um ... dollars I'm under not just Trump\nYeah I Do want to ask you about those dollars themselves we got one listener who wrote on our website the one who dot org please discuss this one hundred ten billion dollars how much is really contracted and over how many years how much is just letters intent carrying we've been hearing about this hundred and ten billion dollar deal do we know what the substance of that really is\nWell that is what the president announced when he visited Saudi Arabia in June of twenty Seventeen even then and I'm not the leading expert on this by any means but even then\nMany people said some of that is already sold some of that is still not contracted so this is a kind of mystical aspirational promise number as opposed to the checks in the mail\nAnd I'm Bruce\nSay that there have been ... in essence most of that is still on the calm this is not um [noise] money that the Saudis have paid um\nIt is true that every time Trump says he ... you know I've got to pay their way I mean we\nWe are not unlike we are with the NATO allies were not funding Saudi Arabia to the fans ah we they do pay by buying American arms so\nI'm Trump is uh\nHis desire to sell them more a and get jobs is perhaps understandable if you're an American president but he is wrong in saying that we're somehow pain for their defense the reason they want American arms as because\nIn an emergency when their regime their country\nShould be at stake as we thought it was in the nineties when Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait it is the Americans who would have to rescue them not the Russians not the Chinese so they won't arms that our guys know how to use and could use and are compatible\nWe're speaking to Karen Elliot how senior fellow at Harvard's bill for Center for science and international affairs and also the former publisher of the wall Street Journal and Sarah Leah Whitson executive director of the middle east and North Africa division of human rights watch Sarah we heard from Karen in terms of Mohammed bin ... among the crown prince who is now the\nHead of the Saudi Government what is your view of him you as I understand you've been rather critical of of what you refer to as kind of normalizing of Mohammed bin ... on by the way she was also featured on sixty minutes as well a few months ago to try to suss out\nWhat seemed to be some kind of modernization of Saudi Arabia\nAh yeah sure so Mohammed bin sudden mine was deliberately packaged and sold to the U.
