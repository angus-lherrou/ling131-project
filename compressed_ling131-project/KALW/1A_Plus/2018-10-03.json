did we get all of your information right um yeah more or less um I haven't endorsed by about Nineteen labor unions as well so I'm going to include that yes of course she couldn't name I Know you don't have to yeah exactly and both of you but I just especially with the money I just\nWant to make sure that is all correct because it's so important so before we get started there's so much to talk about before we talk about your platforms why don't you tell us a little bit about your background and why you decided to run for uh the assembly and the state capital a chunk of backups let's start off with you\nTo um a a commodity\nOur our our homes our health care our education um and so we are where we are because of\nMoney coming into campaign than electing a public official now in Richmond we we showed how we can be done we were once a a company town run by Chevron who inserted millions of dollars you throughout the years to put in elect\nOfficials who would look out for their bottom line and as a result of that um we suffered the people of Richmond suffered\nA but what we did we started running people over profit we started running a Kennedy who would not take one dime and not only not take it but not but also not benefit from it and by that I mean a Kennedy benefit from independent expenditures\n[noise]\n\n[noise] All right we are back in ... sorry about that again this is a cook presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system and you cannot opt out of this but there's nothing to be concerned about sorry about that again junk\nOut his sewing Richmond when we started running truly corporate free candidates we it it that message that value resonated with the people of Richmond so we went from a city council that was loaded with Chevron candidates\nWho and and now a ten years later after a electing\nThese corporate free Kennedy we now have a super majority in the richest city council five\nOut of seven council members to no money and now we see what happens when we have that in a political office\nAnd we did a show actually about that book company which are featured in yet look talking about the money in a minute because that's very unfortunately very very important right now the Buffy Giovanni said that you know one of the reasons why we're in the state and a democratically run state most of the big cities are run by Democrats\nIs because of money and influence by billionaires and corporate greed linear thought how did we get here sure\nMean I think you know you look at 'em as you mentioned California the fifth largest economy in the world and we take into account cost of living it's the highest poverty rate around forty percent\nUm that's unconscionable to me that's something we have to fix I think part of the challenge to if you look at um the California budget and how it's financed it's it's it's a pretty volatile budget in terms of its um really relying on personal income I'm One of the things that I think we absolutely have to fix this proposition Thirteen\nYou know to me that has created one of the biggest funding structural inequities in our state and you look California used to the best public education system in the country\nAnd it started to decline in Nineteen Seventy eight and for me you know doing things like you know split role which is basically closing the commercial loophole and prop Thirteen that's going to be on the ballot and twenty twenty this is one of the mechanisms that I think that we need to implement to create a more sound um funding\nYou care about right but it's also about you know making these things priorities if you look at your budget is your priority so since the early eighties we've seen a five hundred percent increase in corruption spending\nUm as as funding for schools has not kept up right and we've built twenty two prisons and one new UC campus\nSo it's also about what our priorities as a state what our priorities as a community what are the priorities of the leadership in Sacramento to really talk about these things head on and in my opinion we need to be investing on the front end in terms of education as opposed to criminal justice or or or corruption spending and I use that as an example\nOf something that I think is a really important thing that we have got to confront here and you know we've started to but to me the our budget is how we make these decisions it's what our priorities are right and so those are some things I Want to fight for but I think it also comes down to\nUm ... you know closing a loophole in prop Thirteen and some of these other things\nRight well and so can I again going back to how we got here because again these are Democrats that are making these decisions and a lot of these Democrats are supporting you so how are you planning to go\nI mean look at prop Thirteen that was in Nineteen Seventy eight right and right and so and and you know and\nA very Brown's budget is pretty conservative a number of nonprofits say that yeah no he didn't want someone who is known for\nBeing very um you know he's a penny pincher right um and I don't agree with Jerry Brown on a lot of this stuff right some stuff I agree with him on some stuff I don't um I Do think for me we unequivocally need more resources for things like public education right I'm for things like more affordable housing to address our homelessness crisis and I do think\nYou know if you look at what's going to happen you know in the next couple of months right Gavin going to be our governor I think he cares about a lot of this stuff is well he's someone who's been on the record supporting single payer more funding for public schools you know he and I are in a line on a lot of these issues\nUm I think that's why he's endorsed my candidate see someone I Want to work with if I get the job\nBut it's also here's the other big challenge when you look at Sacramento you basically have three parties you got the progressive Democrats moderate Democrats and Republicans right and so it's figure out how to use stitched together the coalition to address some of these\nIssues so obviously democratic socialist javahn because we know where you stand what about you but I\nFeel I'm a progressive Democrat I mean I've spent my entire life working in progressive politics you know and I kind of rattle off some of the things I've done before here in the beginning the show but I've spent my whole life working impressive politics um and I think the exciting opportunity for me about this seat is because it has this seat is a progressive seat\nYou know and it's got such a rich history and culture of organizing impressive activism and it's you know part of where the black Panthers came from the free speech movement so that the exciting thing about this see it as you know this deserves a leader who's going to go there and be very progressive and also deserve someone who can go there and be being a leadership role\nWell let me ask just quickly and then I'll get back to the money where do you see yourself fitting with in the Democratic party because you're both running as Democrats and Giovanni ... we've seen you know a number of democratic socialists are winning their campaigns but there's pushback from the corporate Democrat absolutely so where do you see yourself fitting in that\nRight I I fit in that a base it's a movement I Am a part of a movement a to change politics as usual\nUh right now when you have a a a a a state legislature that the majority Democrats and yet we don't have the things that we need we have to ask ourselves why\nOne of those reasons is always follow follow the money\nAnd so we don't have single payer health care right now because the bill was stuck on at at Anthony ...\nDesk and he and refused to move it on and you look at him he's a Democrat why did he stole this bill will you follow the money and I always encourage people follow the money regardless of what people say and how nice it sounds you follow the money\nAnd with Anthony rent and you follow the money and use\nOf of donations of of of him benefiting from money from the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd so we are where we are because when you have Democrats that are taking money from the very corporations that we are fighting against\nAs people uh we are not going to get the things that we need and so in this movement\nTo reform the way that government is run from from looking at profit and putting profit above the needs of people and above the needs of plant of the planet when lead together\nCome come together in solidarity and change that weekend and have a government that actually works for the people and puts people over the prophet of those corporations insults you follow the money you always see whether or not how that person's going to what is going to vote and really people's voting record also is\nIs very telling of how they're going to continue to vote and whether or not that that you know those individuals even have a voting record or to begin with\nAnd ... according to the California secretary of state's website your campaign has raised just over three hundred and forty nine thousand dollars and I didn't see corporations on your list so you're not taking any money from corporations not taking\nAny money from corporations are not benefiting further and from their independent expenditures because I Will be beholden only to the people of California just as I have been beholden only to the people of Richmond Richmond now has the resources that we need because the only way\nTo know that a candidate is going to actually stand up to those very corporations that are keeping us poor and struggling and without health care and dying\nIs whether or not that Kennedy is an end to know how they're going to vote 'em did that Kennedy ... where did that candidates money come from\nAnd as you both know this people get so angry about this right because there's so much money flooding our system Buffy according to the website California secretary of state you have raised a one million one hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nUm and so we're out there I'm Talking to folks across the district but um so I Can't speak for every volunteer I'm On my campaign but um you know we're very I just to make two hundred and first house party recently so\nI'm a lot of organizing work I've done other campaigns I'm applying to this campaign as well um so uh we're out there um pounding the pavement and and looking to talk to voters\nThink you're a fan and let's go next to Alan in Berkeley Hi Ellen\nOr when I'm I'm a a former I'm a community college graduate and I'm just wondering um er but also been involved in housing activism throughout the day and I was just wondering what do the candidates for the record with the housing crisis and they're\nGreat question Yeah John ... they're\nThe root cause of homelessness is which is an as something that I'm I'm advocating offer us to to not only talk about 'em but to create policies around them and the root causes of homelessness is a\n... you know below living wages people not having living wage wage uh people\nHaving um a issue you\nKnow mental health or a disability people having um\nA substance abuse issues we have to the root causes of homelessness is not is insufficient resources to address the causes of homelessness\nI'm In Richmond that's why we raise the minimum wage we have raised the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour enrichment\nTo really help so many families who are struggling to pay their rent and I and I realize\nThat Fifteen dollars an hour is not a living wage it's still you know but it's it's still leading the way in so many ways a I'm a mental health specialists I've seen that people can get a cat and get the the health services that they need\nThe root causes that we don't have a single payer Medicare for all system uh when people have to go into bankruptcy because they can't afford to pay a pay a medical procedure people lose their homes because they they have to decide whether they will live in their car or afford to pay\nFor the medical procedures that they need there was an awful story of a family who sold this this car that's going around and it was a you know something that was their to their heart sold it because he needed to pay for his wife\nA chemotherapy and then years later\nThe good thing I guess about this story was how the that the family now that then\nBought the car back from someone who is now selling the car to pay for their mothers chemotherapy services sold the root causes is we don't have a single payer for all system the root causes that\nA ... of of homelessness is that corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes so we have to reform a prop Thirteen\nThe root cause is is simply a not simply but in addition to greed um is just we don't have a single payer for all system we don't have the resources in place to provide for um health services mental health services substance abuse services and so\nI think the caller asked about housing but we'll go there and it might write but they're connected either ... yeah ... and then if I may just add\nAnother example is that in ... in in Oakland just last year in Oakland\nThey built four thousand four thousand new luxury market rate housing only three hundred and twenty four of those Hal me was he was a low income affordable income that's the problem we have to build more affordable housing that's why we have to support ...\n... and ... and so I'll answer that question I think the root cause of the housing crisis is that we have not built enough homes and you look at all the research on this and I'm a lot of research says that we're about two million homes shy\nAnd we have the the the least number of homes given the population in California than any other state in this country right and so that's what I see the costs going up\nYou know I strongly believe we need to build more housing bill more transit trends that aren't housing I Believe we need to do more affordable housing you know my opponent has made different decisions on the Richmond city council she abstain from me one hundred percent affordable housing\nI'm a development that would have had a hundred and fifty five units [noise]\nUm I Would have voted for and champion something like that and so for me I Believe the root causes we need more housing we need more affordable I support more affordable housing middle income market rate workforce housing all of the above we've got to build more housing and that means approving projects that actually result in building homes junk\nStaying I Would love to talk about that because it's partly true ah the the the crews and the fact of the matter is that I voted\nFor we now have in the in the works of we're going to be groundbreaking for\nA one hundred a hundred percent affordable housing on McDonnell won on having another one on cutting so the one that I voted for that we will be a that will be breaking ground soon is going to be a hundred percent affordable housing I\nAbstained on the developer\nWho had so many issues in different communities of color\nTaken advantage of this the community so I did not want to vote for them but I did in fact vote for another developer who will be building those affordable housing and we'd just a cut a ribbon on a beautiful one hundred percent affordable housing\nOr in the south side it's called a ... a housing development where the old a Japanese American a rose gardens where we just opened a hundred units\nAre in every last one of those units accepted section eight and this was for seniors and so I'm really proud of that\nWe also opened up a couple of years ago another one hundred percent affordable housing on harbor away for seeing it with the seniors in particular but the three new developments that are becoming on cutting avenue that will be coming on ... avenue that will be coming on McDonnell avenue are all affordable housing and I'm really proud of that\n... [noise] yeah I mean I I I for me the root causes the lack of supply\nUm and so in order to ensure that we are building enough it means we need to support things like transit oriented housing and and I think Sacramento can play a role in helping to do that I mean those are things that I wouldn't want to work and you know I've been endorsed by David ... who is chair of the housing committee who's been a champion on these issues who I'm going to work with hand in glove\nI'm In Sacramento we've got to be able to do more housing I also think we needed to do things like\nUm incentivizing things like eighty units right there's a lot of housing in the East Bay where folks have detached garages they want to be able to turn those into um livable places they don't have a lot of money lying around to do that 'cause it's very expensive but if we had things like a public infrastructure bank\nThat would then allow for um a reasonable rates if you how someone who's low income there's things like that they think we can do a win win win but I Believe that the you know my opponent has said we don't suffer from a housing shortage crisis we suffer from an affordability crisis\nAnd to me when she says that that means that she believes that we don't actually have a shortage of housing and I believe that we have a shortage of housing junk I Do think we have a shortage of housing\nAh we have a show at the statement as you said was that I said is we don't have an a for a housing shortage we have an affordability shortage\nSo I had on my platform or I Will be proposing a housing for all program that will build hundreds of thousands of new affordable housing and affordable public housing\nSeeing speculation and taxing vacant properties a ... for it to be a fully sufficient as sustainable um little let me just jump right Lenny of vacant property\nI also want to ask about the people who are wake up every morning wondering if they're going to have an eviction notice on their front door because the rents are off the charts I've talked to you know people who are on Social Security a thousand dollars a month and at the end of the month they've got fifty dollars less\nI mean it's it's horrific so Trump ten would repeal Costa Hawkins which would allow local governments to implement rent controlled junket you support it absolutely Buffy where do you stand on prop ... I don't\nSupport it and let me tell you why you know I'm ... and first of all let me say I'm I recognize the value of rent control and I know that there are families across this you know our cities here in the bay area who that's listening separating them between being in a home and having to leave our communities or or potentially even be on the streets [noise]\nUm but my concern about it and I've talked to a lot of folks that um the work in the Affordable housing space that build affordable housing\nUm affordable housing advocates and others um as well as the building trades labor unions and the ... and they're all and opposed to prop ten because they're worried that while we all agree the rent is too damn high that's the saying right I agree with that sentiment completely\nThat if this passes there's potential that because I actually exacerbate our crisis by helping the construction of new homes\nAnd to me my I Believe that the root cause of the problem is is that we don't have enough homes right now I strongly believe we need reforms\nAnd you know it depending on what happens in November with a ballot measure if it doesn't pass I Will work for those reforms in Sacramento I think there's a couple of things you could do a rolling date is one idea to exempt new construction which would thereby\nIn my opinion would be a little bit more of a um a appropriate way to deal with this that allows cities have more control but doesn't have the unintended consequences the other thing that I think we should do is\nI'm immediately pass some kind of anti gouging um rent rent control caps at the state level rent kept the state level anti gouging so that landlords can't do this raising twenty thirty forty percent that's where I think you see the real detriment of what's happening right so to me that's another way and if you pass it legislatively it could go across the across the board statewide instantaneously\nVery quickly wouldn't have to go to the ballot fill and there's other ideas to I can", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
