I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew what passed for them and not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of strength to strength become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my eating whether they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons of important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean amount for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very sort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real right like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nNow I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know\nIt's like ... it was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed up as you say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm\nSo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives in like that\nWas important um but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just get language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out for ... most of my all their career if not all of my career but I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute\nWhere it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there's a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ...\nAnd they have to yeah you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there is not to waste to be gate and like\nThose white pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like\nYou know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life do I leave so that like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that we were working with research right now and trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that it's not that people when people get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that ah\nThat they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin or friend re like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'd say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protests community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds\nInteresting is that all those people who who commits offer for quote participating in this system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally when like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now like that is a ... that was a wild statement of the day and it's wild to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\nTo put in the face and you think about even there are a lot of really really public people and movements face who literally just would not say anything about Hillary that wasn't she was a monster and like you don't have to agree with all the Hillary stuffed to know that like she was a better choice in this guy so it's about what sort of interesting\nUh well we tried to charge right there for this was I hate to cut you short but I like you I Want to dig into that a little bit further because what you touched on\nI think is also one of the issues that especially Democrats are wringing their hands over with regards to the midterms a lot of the polls suggest that there's real strong activation but you're right there were a lot of people who said\nAnd it's not going to make a difference I don't like her at all like on their mob since I'm staying home on election day ... and ... it seems like the tide has turned for a lot of Democrats I Wonder how you see it though do you see\nPeople more willing to engage in politics conventionally voting for example or do you think maybe Democrats of being a little wishful in their thinking\nNo I think people definitely want to get into that I think the big lesson twenty six team of that like\nJust voting against something actually isn't a motivator I think the younger people want to vote for something and I think that's where the party is sort of missing their messages that like\nTrumping crazy he was crazy before he became president and that alone wasn't a motivator he's crazy now and like that actually it still isn't necessarily a motivator for people for some people with a D motivated because they feel like he's so wild and nothing can change to like just voting against him if not I think that's like the wrong message\nThat second hand like this is sort of battle with Obama that just\nA telling people what they really care about the countries that do vote is also the bad message at like there's a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
