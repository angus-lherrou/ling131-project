A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one eh\nWhat is it about this mid term it's energizing so many voters so much and getting so many of them to vote early\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is David ... the director of American University's Center for congressional and presidential studies American University owns WAMC you the public radio station that produces won a David welcome to the program\nThanks a lot I'm Glad to be here can we be clear on what we mean first of all by early voting are we talking about people showing up at a collective polling place or people mailing in mail in ballots or all of it what do we mean\nBoth of those so other really three different types there's absentee voting that takes place in in most states where you just need an excuse and and sometimes as excuses had been been loosened for people are there is a male and voting which is distinct from that in certain states where\nAnybody can mail in their their ballot early if they want to uh and then there is early in person voting which has been expanding cycle after cycle in recent years but when you say an excuse what kinds of excuses or are we talking about\nWell if you're serving overseas or in the military of course or if you're an ex pat but\nIncreasingly just if if you're sick or if you're um elderly or if there are reasons why you know you're not going to be around on election day they'll give you an absentee ballot what's our sense of where the early voting total stand right now\nOr across America team is headed to use this election season with live a fence town halls are just conversations at the coffee shop\nThe corporation for public broadcasting do you feel like you've been ignored by the national media especially getting ignored around the time of big elections\nYou can tell us all about it on the across America page of our website the one eight dot org that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org or you can email us across America at W. A. M. A. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua laugh joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an election just 'cause of turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know a ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated county Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had request for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me speak with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how this Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas\nTo a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it I'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option we heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWill ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you so you got to do a lot of research in Colorado is your is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or a cup of tea my whatever you want a bird with\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm a you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um and now you've got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting and\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object in mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day got to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan if if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and why are they are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another is maybe due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nPossibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having that\nOr is and wait to vote for that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to Philly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and the environment for K. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nTracey is listening from Texas and Tracy emailed\nI cast my ballot first thing on the first day of early voting because no one ever knows what may blow up and getting your way hello Harvey referring to that hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast last year\nInterested so he let me stick with you for a minute about what issues voters are fired up about particularly those that are showing up at the polls early\nSure I mean I think sort of the pocketbook issues right one of the things that I've just been fascinated about here in Michigan but I think it's a you know throughout the country is health care\nAnd we've got a democratic candidates are running at about you know that Republicans want to take away health care and you even have Republicans right now basically I wouldn't say running\nFor Obamacare or the a C a they don't talk about it that way but saying things like no we want to keep that you know coverage for preexisting conditions I'm thinking about our gubernatorial race and\nBack now to our conversation with Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio Michael do you want to move to UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian Gorman of K. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America\nWill be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role in national elections before them come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted\nI voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county wrote on our Facebook page I'm choosing to vote on election day because I bring my children and want them to see and feel the import of this right\nAnd Melissa tweeted I Love to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nZoe I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're at one a vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting after you do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation\nProposal and to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier\nMakes apps and chain voting available to all\nAnd finally to prove it straight ticket voting those are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving his voice mail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking of that proposal to which is a redistricting as he is ... and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a barn storm of up\nA ballad I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays for signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians is propped to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Fay he's twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nYou've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of\nSeniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls this year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de ... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures\nAnd who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization got four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nLike you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get the money from the device organization just last week or putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is that promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for human I see it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me\nBut the ads me see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by companies and they say you're going to lose all your jobs all your schools are going to close\nFires going to rain down from the sky it it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly vis couch or argument the ... and Jennifer so she's been seeing on MTV\nAren't sure it will be a ... to put a finger pointing out at right now there are also a a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are and and supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells are you know just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's homes schools places work\nAnd that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh the MIT pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which has been which big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site a but just how difficult that is will you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted are but there was an analysis from um another one\nThe methodology are taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost in with it\nUm there are jobs and a potential economic impacts um estimates are into the billions of dollars a day one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side as supporters one twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuated and decline in recent years and it it's now about five percent\nOf the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs um and ah ... you know they um note that the um uh current oil and gas operations those wouldn't be affected at all\nRight Michael let me speak with you for just one second uh you've been covering the governor's race to rather well the candidates are running one related to the Bush family the other made millions in online businesses can you give us a sense of how much that race is or is not driving early voting\n... you know it's it's tough to sell or the two candidates are a Democrat you're a polish and Republican Walker Stapleton and\nI'm a you know a Walker Stapleton is currently the state treasurer a juror polish is a congressman I'm a ... a Stapleton as a relative of the Bush family planned and I'm\nAnd I'm a poll is um he has made his um millions in tech and and business and\nUm you know so far a polish has consistently leading in all the polls though the ones that are public but there there haven't been that many polls and there's probably room to quibble about the polls and I I don't want to go into a rabbit hole writer but you know uh\nYou know they're going to involve telephone polling in I mean landlines right in so I'm most people have a lot of people have cell phones these days and it tends to be older people who have landlines so\nI'm a you know no doubt though of of both of these candidates are wealthy", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
