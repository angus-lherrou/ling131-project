Joshua Johnson well the report is in the FBI has submitted the results of its limited investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report came in late last night we're told hours after that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion\nFor a friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor the final vote on whether it confirmed him is expected to happen Saturday\nJoining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome thank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we do people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of a judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim ... and Chris Garrett\nA as well as one friend of of Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't\nKnow what all\nThe FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a trim and Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public of this one didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it and and every political operative does too\nWell uh the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that the dates back round a decade uh but what journal\nI'm an nominee that will send it over to a Senate Judiciary committee us generally held in the Judiciary Committee safe\nToday it's being held in a secure location in the capital and which senators can come down and look at it there are dismayed is basically working and shift right now we're Democrats were getting our um to take a look at it and then Republicans and there are small handful of a staffers who have clearance to see this as as well but basically\nPeople are members are coming in getting a a look at the report they can get briefed on it but this is all happening within basically the bowels of the of the capital right now\nNow I'm Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer say she has not been interviewed by the FBI and this inquiry doesn't appear that Brett Kavanaugh has been interviewed even though he has gone through several levels of interviews at at several stages of this\nOf this process I'm Ryan what about the seemingly large list of people who said they had or have information relevant\nNot only to Brett Kavanaugh's behavior in high school or college but also whether he was truthful or may have lied in front of the Senate when he gave sworn testimony about his past what about that listen to people who says they want to talk to the FBI but the FBI never came calling\nOr if not the Olympics do you think of the host of the twenty fourteen fee for World Cup [noise]\n\nNeymar has got a goal or maybe your mind wanders back even further to two thousand and one when Brazil was predicted to become one of the world's top economies by\nBut there's not a short amount a list of goals and ambitions these countries lay down and our second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average\nAnd its current president boasts of an approval rating of just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival\nFernando ... died on Sunday\nAnd the lead up to the election has already been packed\nWith drama including balls and arrows near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you on her ... year to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAs ... as a\nRetired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nUm but despite having sat in Congress ...\nFirst so much time and he he shows ... open loading for uh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple\nOf years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot more with\nPeople when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and old over his nearest rival it\nLooks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth and that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to\nFace with this Fernando ...\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty fifty\nAnd this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five\nBut being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people that we both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as fiery as ...\nYou ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the tea um he's someone who sort of an outside are when you look at the composition of the beat the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUh that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so\nA lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow um is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who\nNecessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend that\nWe're gonna talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're gonna talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're going to talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nOr one important feature here is ... how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nWith both for when they more like the according to the late ... that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood before and with people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil a regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics\nWith politicians and there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics now right I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm\nRO has a history of violent rhetoric has been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers are thieves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his state\nIt was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both in our own he he almost died by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by\nThe more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both so narrow as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic simplicity they really had to tone down or in\nSome cases eliminate totally they're attacked it's also allowed ... to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as the otherwise would have had to I mean he either as a huge\nProbably the biggest presidents debate\nIs scheduled for tonight he's not going to take place will be the only candidate who's not there because he says the doctor has ordered him to rest and it's basically it's it's created a situation of huge uncertainty\nWe we don't really know what kind of leader are both in our would be selected um but\nHe continues to grow in polls perhaps as a result because again as as Monica was saying that the fear of the leftist government of the Workers Party coming back is so strong that even people who kind of are disgusted by some of his political rhetoric in the past against or even recently against women\nAnd gays\nBlacks and other minorities are are just so terrified of the other side coming in that they're willing to to throw their support behind\nWhere we've been hearing about just that from one a listeners ... writes the center left workers' party ruined Brazil as a nation take note America\nOr wash scandal they will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party now Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and abroad\nOffensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have all the will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred well let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context to think\nThe most important I'm finding of love as you had to or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty sixteen\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of her of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation she wasn't she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that she suffered\nWas really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow love our jobs if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instill defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment overt sad as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated in the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources\nBut it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states Apollo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nBut now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country protests and\nTo be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build the country ah one of the major ... is the size of the workers for too far to the was led\nBy a man born in poverty a that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a\nA basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression to Brazil\nThan reality hits a ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a lot of a shot to Cain\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians\nA and another thing that just pull things should be positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke and we have run off the money\nAh all that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government says run all the money we have to adjust the economy\nThe measures necessary to do this are very off an\nUnpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why how they plan to go from the\nJews now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion\nWell if you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going\nReally well which you've mentioned tied the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its\nPoliticians because of this corruption scandal\nThan virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew\nResearch Center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both in our own if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turned it could involve the curtailing of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I and my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile I and that's just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous\nPeriods of military rule Nineteen sixty four\nWas the last two I thought that that was real results that had been firmly relegated to the history books and you know maybe\nMaybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are stared right now\nWell Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian said\nAnd it now um and right to the point frying Ramirez emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus elect in Brazil ... is another ... he's an air to want a ... a Kim ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America\nAll of them are loads for their corruption their narcissism\nAnd a total lack of democracy and power in\nThe United states it's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian\nVersion a Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump through both right wing they're both populists\nAre these are these ... comparisons apps do you think\nI don't think so I think a President Trump is quite sophisticated compared to both of them are really really ... sophisticated but he has obviously a uh dealt with businesses in the United states he has\nA a a history in Wall Street in a hotel business boso NATO has memos that he has zero sophistication a he has never run a thing in his life\nHe has been in Congress for twenty seven years there's one law\nOr to his name and ah ah he says\nIn the face of does more on those economic problem Brazil has he says more he said already more than the ones I Know nothing about the economy\nAs he has one economist is a liberal a saying that we're going to privatize state confronted we're going to read for this and that we know for sure that we will not be going we're not going to be that\nDo that because Congress or will block and such that nothing will change in the\nUpcoming Brazil in Congress also being elected the Sunday so you have a polarized presidential election with a kind of normal election for governor for Congress level where this very exhausted political system in Brazil has not renewed itself\nAnd things are probably going to stay stagnant", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04"}
