immigration policy our economy national security diversity is Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's an election about everything that makes us in America right now\nAnd in states like New Hampshire those national

P.

H. M. U. dot org the medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked Casey Kendra\nAnd voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's name still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primary than in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and mentor mirrors\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that they're focused on delivering that\nTwenty three at turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference\nYou about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do well\nWhen we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about them in terms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina\nAnd I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House but they house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own it so I Need to know what the host or not if it's a it's an issue where\nIf my vote might be the deciding vote\nAnd I need all I Need some old you are to divide and it it actually changes my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment Dominican that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean the the tried and true a criticism\nI Would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling uh I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nI should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which he called can we trust polls\nOn our website to search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one bullet or a dot org\nWanna I also kind of feel like the comment we heard from Alan Hughes exactly what many democratic operatives are afraid of that Democrats would be like oh it's a shoe in ... I ... I don't need to go vote as opposed to saying no I'm going to vote because my vote matters Allen sounds exactly like the kind of voter and God Bless them\nBut the exactly like the kind of voters it makes many democratic operatives tear their hair out\nThat is absolutely right when I've spoken to democratic operatives and those and democratic and progressive leaning outside groups they're worried ... about voters like Alan while they see their chance they're good at taking back the house they've really been focusing on a message of social responsibility and take our thinking of the conversation I had with\nFolks over at the end up ... who said that they're telling our message to make sure\nThat voting as a responsibility that comes a pattern for their voters so that they show up again and again and again because there are elections every year and they're trying to set the sense that yes while maybe Democrats stand a chance of taking back the house and twenty Eighteen there is an election almost every year coming up now and this is really the ground game they're setting I had for twenty twenty so that those voters\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think lawyers pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump and they said um I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they salmon and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out they said if they got to try a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump face on it they'd be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that matching you're talking about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear that healthcare message I think as demanding to know that being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene with one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould try and raise ... New York\nSo often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for searching for\nThe Republicans that stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\nThat to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too\nBroad brush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did a regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the party sand for very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nStudio I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listening\nTo go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do\nA it is a memorable and it certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... [laughter] that's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nThe medical touch on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers\nOf women running a record numbers of el ... out L G two candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier give us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire their ... who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again and we look at the power of the midterms women they have been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected when we're talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill area have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have\nA female senator in that seat I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of the Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to chew women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went and\nFrom the local the local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when in female candidates so there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel\nBrett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and these women were really and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that's something he doesn't like it is something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where does women come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have helping you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\nRunning or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before that long expedition she gave in the Senate floor\nThat made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I haven't personally seen that'd be made into any kind of political hay for democratic candidates would have have you\nWell she's lucky she's not up for re election year if she were a she would certainly have a lot of pressure on her back there in the same way that a lot of these Democrats\nIn red states that President Trump won have had to weigh and measure\nTheir vote for Brett Kavanaugh I mean you know it's no surprise that Joe mansion minutes after Susan ... Susan Collins a says she was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh he released a statement saying that he would vote for break out on it would've been a whole lot different if Susan Collins I come out and said she was going to be against Brett Kavanaugh what would Joe Manchin do then\nJenny from India emailed my concern is voter suppression\nI'm terrified that the votes will not be counted correctly it is frightening what is happening in North Dakota in Georgia what can be done to stop this we heard from quite a few of you about voter suppression including one of our listeners in North Carolina who lifted notes who are out one a vox pop\nThis is God's ray from Charlotte my biggest concern is that people will not understand or recognize how important their vote for this election and how that can have ramifications on\nThe elimination of names from voter long how can we be a country that champions and promote democracy when we don't make it easy for all citizens to vote not just for what benefits certain party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "18"}
