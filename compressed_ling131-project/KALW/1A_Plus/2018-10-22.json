A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one hey Mr Mayor you're in the home stretch of this race just a few more weeks to go how's the campaign trail going so far it's going well we're\nUh here in the final Fifteen days of this race filling\nUm amazing energy out here on the trail we feel the wind at our backs up proud of our performance last night at the debate and frankly all looking forward to over the next Fifteen days making the closed in case the ... as to why I ought to be the next governor lead this day forward\nYeah wonder where you see that closing case right now I mean we're in a very polarized political environment but we are also a nation with lots of moderates and independents Florida has plenty of them as you know it's kind of why we're a perennial swing state and I'm speaking as a native Floridians I Wonder what you think\nHas those voters who haven't quite decided between you or Rhonda sets us on the fence where do you think that you still need to close the case in the next few weeks one I mean I think I still have to work to expose a\nMystery to standards as record to the the people of the state of Florida particularly on the issue of healthcare\nA while a member of Congress or he voted over a dozen times to repeal Obamacare are going so far as the the the government shutdown in order to see his a radical extreme policies at the far right of the governing party I'm a six years in Congress never saw a piece of legislation passed a under his signature\nUm uh and uh I also voted wild there to see an insurance company to be able to discriminate against people based off the pre existing conditions\nUm there are a lot of areas where we disagree but certainly on that I consider him unqualified for the office when you consider that one in five people in the state of Florida don't have access to insurance and that we've got a probably every one of your listeners are sitting next to or have someone in their household who has a preexisting condition\nUm the fact that you would be in favor of allowing insurance companies to charge more or to deny coverage\nOr in my opinion again is disqualified for the office so\nI Want to make sure that people understand who Methodist than it is and the reason he has yet to produce a healthcare plan for the state of Florida is because Floridians would be terrified to learn if he were to speak honestly with him about what his plans are quite frankly to increase costs jak costs and reduce coverage\nI Wonder how you view the perspective of Florida voters considering that the outgoing governor of Florida Rick Scott was a health care executive and he's\nA ... pretty well aligned with President Trump on many things I was a two term governor of the of the state of Florida do you get the sense that Floridians are really tracking with you as it relates to health care or maybe as your diversity in the political views\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the reddish to parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our states Larry\nThat is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael uh we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nUp to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return that we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not the politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm ism no consequence there Floridians and they were part of a of our state they is often been forgotten whether forgotten cos would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to defined in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of\nThe state of Florida before we had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor ... that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYeah no it's it's such a fair point an ... and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger\nGulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't lift that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well listen\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes\nI'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an ... resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea Mm I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is going to be a statewide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda ... take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice of the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is released Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor again thank you are or appreciate the opportunity I Do want to know that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties mostly the counties here in the W well around listening area\nIncluding Palm Beach wrote in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Louis good to hear your voice again or I'm too I'm well aware and thankful for your mind to it the early voting we actually has some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think what we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm a I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together for two years or making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that the main then I'm convinced them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing or maybe on dealing with\nThey pulled down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through\nAnd he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can\nProduce and and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with a law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nYeah I mean so first I mean a shape that shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience and I remember deciding at a very early age that I never want it to see\nThat expression on my mom's face because of something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first of my seven siblings to graduate from high school and as a fifth of seven kids in the first to graduate from college when my brother guy home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job to job and got told no after no after no\nAnd it really did shake my belief that listen how can we say we want people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps to redeem themselves to reintroduce themselves into society when we then create all of these barriers that keep them from being able to do just that\nAnd so you know as a as a mayor I led the effort to ban the box in my city we don't ask about criminal background history and less answering yes as a disqualified for the position if it's not we're going to measure people off their merit argues skilled you qualify can you do the work\nAnd what we've learned is that these individuals' happened to be some of the hardest working people we have within our government because they know what it means to be without\n'em and if we're serious about trying to re introduce people into society that we've got to think about what are those ways that we can get people dignity that comes with work again because once they've had access to a job where they can earn an honest wage an honest living and it'll be a good example for our communities um\nIt helps us that our crime rate level because the best way to control crime is to reduce the amount of people re offending it's important and it's played a big role in my thinking around\nA criminal justice reform writ large mayor Gillum one of the key ways that some are proposing to reintegrate folks back in the society has to do with a ballot initiative coming up next month it would give formerly incarcerated people they're voting rights back in the Florida now former attorney general Eric Holder has spoken out about this issue before here's part of what he has set\nTo three six one a one a or use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nYeah definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election\nYeah I mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate across frankly all communities um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump won ... thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today um which students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nUm um buddy quest forget them I'm a a little while ago was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... baby ... uh which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand Buddhist turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor deal in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps all of a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida let me amalgam eight to questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground or you know it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders I'm a onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of context the castle doctrine you referring to basically is that kind of your home as your castle idea that says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened anywhere you have a legal right to be just\nTo be anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nI'm In black and brown children feel particularly\nI'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and trace of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to claim as dangerous as stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say Iran\nI Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check to do things like a convicted or a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gunshots\nBuy the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks you kiss you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was to assume decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you for the opportunity good luck everybody go vote to liberty in St Louis Hernandez the host of sun dialing double you all are in public radio in Miami you can find more of the stations excellent coverage including a guide\nTo all the referenda in Florida on this month's next month's ballot\nAt W. L. R. N. dot org Lewis thanks for talking to us\nAnd thanks you Joshua thank you let's see I'm Out from Florida and look more nationally now what's going on to other gubernatorial races around the country which one should we be paying close attention to and with all eyes it seems on Washington these days how local are these elections really\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Daniel Strauss who covers politics for political Daniel welcome to want to say thanks for having me thoughts on Florida's governor's race it sounds like\nIn some ways the Florida gubernatorial race is a microcosm of politics in America right now in addition to all the other issues that are kind of spoke to Florida but it kind of seems like Florida is always microcosm of national politics\nYeah I I mean I Can't think of a better a\nGubernatorial race that represents a two of the key sort of issues right now one is a President Trump as embodied by mayor Gillum challenge or a or opponent a round to Santa's the Sanders has been a die hard fan for a lot longer than a lot of Trump's\nA standard bearers in Congress and in elected office\nAnd uh the other thing is you guys had on his race um this is a topic that\nIs coming up throughout a number of major gubernatorial in Senate races or it is voting rights as a key issue in Georgia right now and this is something that a a certain sort of overshadowed the Florida governor's race as well\nYou know it's something we didn't have time to get into with with mayor Gillum but there was that comment that Ron dissent dismayed basically right after the primary after Andrew Gillum became the Democratic nominee and he became a Republican nominee\nBasically expressing his hopes that Florida didn't in Mr dissent assist words monkeys is up\nBy making the wrong decision that of course was widely taken to be a sideways slam at Andrew Gillum who who is black to sit still feel like it's an issue at the top of the race has a kind of blend in with all the other big issues it's funny and sort of the seed\nFrom which ah grew the sort of the plant or the tree that\nUh is dominating this race right now um I don't think that particular a comment is the trending a a topic of discussion in the Florida governor's race but it it underscores that race relations remains a key issue in Florida\nSo of course Florida is going to be a a big race this year I may be a bit biased considering that I'm a native Floridian it always seems to be a big race but there are thirty six stupidest oil races around the country right now are the one or two maybe other than Florida that stand out to you as the most worth watching kind of no matter where you are in the country\nOr Georgia would be one uh Stacey Abrams versus the secretary of state Brian Kemp uh Ohio where are the former ah", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
