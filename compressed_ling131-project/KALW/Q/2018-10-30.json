I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but he renounced his racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\n... welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black\nIs still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find done black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white national slogans fourteen or first throughout a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm fucked us about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this quote unquote race for that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a I'm a ... I had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to that sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about uh you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people you know it's it's\nA ludicrous idea um but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and now white genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and washing my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting and synagogue\nI'm In ... is the same that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nSome really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to the people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but\nThe people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the Pentagon yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think\nThat for him because I think every time something like this happen he feels small way it's awful and he wanders at you know how much three messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism\nPleasing to incidents like this and there was central to creating a phrase white genocide into the popular movement said to them that somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio for years and you're young wife is a I guess it's haunting\nYou liked fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack of former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n...\n... ...\nNo Mm Mm\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we announce in those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front [noise]\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included Sasha though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to is like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by my race\nIs an idea but in popular everywhere and white nationalism is so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when you found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody in that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what did they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that the uh\nAnd racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and maybe unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward they lay their clients to word um\nRacial less racial ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nUm I'm\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY

music continues at ten with the record shows and an eleven relevant tones all had here on K. A. L. W. stay with us\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives and their parents had had because society was trying to\nUndermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think gets to the core issue that um your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we gonna\nAnd the issues are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and be a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September

September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader who renounced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo Derrick one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were outed by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must of publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when I found that you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nAnd then exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stevens and and mostly Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart\nOf it or not talking to me about it ah I went\nTo those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interest that and did a and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at\nAllowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from and it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about what we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that offensive I actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy when you stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of ... out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who\nAh who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him\nBut to build a relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that's not happening quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWhich sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\n[noise] uh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and\nAre are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degree\nA family of Hungarian Jews that was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in ... and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by ... by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact of the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have in fact\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement [noise] can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust and ... and", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "30"}
