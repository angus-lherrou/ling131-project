Jared J. ... and his official author name as a tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph jak because ask a welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award\nOh thank you so much Terry Gross\n[laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting me 'cause they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it when you when you have these addictions and your families I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school somewhat but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share that story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how come your grandparents are raising you as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are though I'm an adult and I really liked it\nNo\nAt the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience it to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday on my wedding shower was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always have thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so\nWe're raising in the family they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always frauds [noise] ah ... surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but then of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing I mean you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but catching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know ... the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so we certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to carry your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have that reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh this is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book\nThe whole book and without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just\nAdd like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that the that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the arts and specifically use teaching ... classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally and this and that moment ah and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upsetting but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think one should be you know [laughter] route one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction is\nNominated for a National Book award in the category of young people's literature we'll talk more after a break I'm

I live in North Hampton I live an hour from western no agency the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she is she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah there was the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested um and then get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the a police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her without a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always\n... ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long in Detroit process where I'm really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and I know I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the work to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open a closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven company me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly will be living with you till later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all all of her drug paraphernalia [noise]\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know there's there's the cedar closet and this other room right now of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the feed her closet\nSo I ... I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little nicer than I saw a handgun and then on the lazy boy there I saw three handguns and next so that was to handguns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who's high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom his last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me\nSo I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know as loud as I could I said well Steve and you know the the dresses in here I'm just going to go to Macy's and uh by her address and the and he just looked at me

things I wanted to hold onto in the event that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for my mother's memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper till afterwards\nBut now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut the ... in the interim between that moment and and the

the police it's good and and and and come to find out all of those handguns were Bebe guns made to look like real guns\nUm and that but that didn't change\nMy heart was racing in that moment
