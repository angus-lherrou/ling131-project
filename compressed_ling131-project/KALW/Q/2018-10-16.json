as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air and it's a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years or near okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lotta straight white guys so women some people's color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of times standup feels incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men and the audience [noise]\nYeah I mean I think he just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really started posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I finally got into a place where I can ... is that allowed now have to believe it too so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not gonna [laughter]\n\nI'm Sorry I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a ... we did our why why tore across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we\nHave different energy that allowed the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell a joke in a different way or different style and we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm like thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about oh this one time I got my hair done\nAt the salon and they did this to my hair like totally like messed it up I couldn't talk about my black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she's she's just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman\n[noise] you're right about body image in your book and you say yeah as you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dues and\nFor failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to like\nAll edge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self doubt come and so I think what I have done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house\nI make it is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nAnd a few more powerful the little bit of experiences that

I'm so sorry and I'm like they knew what size I was four weeks before I showed up\nI is not my fault I'm decides that I Know\nThere's an afterword an addendum to your book in part of your book is

defined me or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of\nFigure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never wants to check in and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um and just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the

the division welcome to fresh air [noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here um the plantation of your novels in Barbados as I gather you do\nIn Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings I from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know there were were expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe yeah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character book or George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work around those plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and ah he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested wash because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes led forever

and not are betraying us forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiments in that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this\nThis young man is just completely [noise] you just don't naturally a gifted it a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nAnd in ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of were prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy or about life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash escapes from slavery and becomes a free man he is not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on them plenty\nHow much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that to try and teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in my ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nAnd he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place in in the world but he's not really thinking about the fact that
