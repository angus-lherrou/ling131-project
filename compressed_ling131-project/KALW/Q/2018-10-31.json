I don't need a continued right okay great um I think first and foremost a\nAnd this was just kind of lifestyle and approaching generally how we make decisions I Want to make sure everyone is at the table when I get a good understanding of what exactly is happening or at the school like given that I probably not there on a day to day\nI think first and foremost one I Want to make sure I bring school a school staff of family I and districts got together to better understand the situation for myself speaking with my colleague on the board et cetera or number two I Would immediately reach out to the superintendent to make sure that they're aware that I'm aware\nA and ensure that the parents and their families directly connected to a superintendent to figure out how to best navigate the situation\nI'm I'm deeply deeply committed to ensuring that our district staffer fully aware of what our expectations are as a board and how we communicate with families and the time when it's in which we respond to incidents on campus um and first and\nFeel that they are hurt a I think the timing of that response is going to be tough and depending on the superintendent I'm but I'm committed to hearing the voice of parents thank you the next candidate as a leader Fisher place\n\nFirst I Want to correct I I realized after I was thinking back I call myself an African American parent I Need to be very clear I'm a white parent of African American students that's just for those who are listening on the radio um\nBut I Would approach this with the mentality of those who are closest to the problem are also closest to the solution um and as the chair of the community advisory committee for special education I Do a lot of work with my fellow advisory committees a pack\nThe parent advisory committee the district high English learners advisory committee um there's a lot of us who work together on joint problem solving because so many of the issues that students face whether it's a student with a disability or minority students are in English learners they're very similar in nature and so we do a lot of community brainstorming\nOn in fact we have a recent situation at ... ... elementary school where families have\nBeen coming to the board because they haven't been able to hire a Spanish emergence teacher all year I'm so one of the things that we've proposed to bring a central office staff to the school a certificate of teacher we need to do some outside of the box thinking for situations like this thank you the next candidate Roger ... place\nUp\nThe first thing I Would do would be to meet with the parents are that were involved an acknowledged the situation get their side of the story and make sure that I truly understood what they were or what the issue was\nAnd let them know that I was hearing them than I Would go and meet with people at the school site or in the appropriate department\nTo make sure that are that they understood that there was a problem and to find out what could be done about it and to come up with solutions and then\nDepending on the situation a turn around and meet with the the parents are given to let them to give them an update or making sure that there's translation available and case that's part of the issue\nUm inappropriate involved the principal or other departments are who might be a need to be there and then if it were something that we are going to take was going to take a while to resolve I Would update them frequently thank you\nThank you next candidate lead me I Love it please\n[noise]\nThis is not a hypothetical situation that one of my City College students said that in high school she had not had a permanent teacher in our math class all year and this was an advance math class\nSo three steps first step is a critical meeting I call it that from personal experience having worked with a self USD adds to the college where you have to have that meaning right away to build trust to build planned\nAnd if it's the case of a classroom that's been destabilized let's spring and the families with spring and the principal or the vice principals and you'll start conversations get things going the next step is to actually close the loop because that's not sufficient to have that first conversation\nYou really need to bring the stakeholders so again the family also the educators I'm into school social workers were needed a minister ration and perhaps elected officials as was recently a case with a\nBilingual classrooms that was missing a teacher and then finally the community if this is really important we have to look to see if there are systemic issues and is there special ed involved um or their budgetary issues by that classroom isn't I'm being\nLisa thank you next candidate is lack life Hi please\n\nBut we have twentieth century communication and I think in order to get out from under the just the volume of requests um\nThat come in we need to have some systems change and one thing I Would look at it as a three one one system that helps parents to navigate common question and common issues that arise and also use that system to have accountability about who gets answers who gets responses and who does it so we can move toward equity in how\nWe're communicating with parents and family and\nUm so that's sort of big overarching changed the second thing is that as a commissioner um whenever anyone emails me they will get an immediate reply that lists the staff contact information for the most commonly ask questions and give some guidelines for you know what steps I Would hope that parents and families and students take\nTo explore something before bringing it to the board level because we can't answer every question and do the work that needs to be done and finally with those situations that are truly urgent I Would you know the parent and tell them what was going to my timeline for looking into things in responding and then do some of the things I mentioned before thank you\nThank you the next candidate is Alison Collins please I'm I've dealt with this gene\nParker we had a teacher that was out we had rolling stops\nIt was difficult because a lot of the families were Chinese seeking and so I think that's also something that needs to be addressed there's a lot of times with monolingual families are families that are not professional they may not be emailing or you know they're ... lifting their complaints\nAnd so I'm Talking to families is important but also making sure some families are telling me that they're going to the office for family boys they are getting turned away or they're not you know we're we're not documenting what's happening and I think that's a crucial step\nIn following through with a with the sights as making sure that things are getting documented I'm In a lot of times these aren't getting documented and then they just purchased\nUm so and ultimately this comes down to management and resources um as it was as we mentioned before sometimes teachers are leaving I'm not just because there's like a fluke but there may be systemic things going on at the school um when there's leadership\nThat maybe is not as supportive as we would like or when there's not enough resources to deal with issues of the school that's when you see large numbers of teachers leaving and that's something that needs to be addressed as well\nThank you the next candidate is gravity Ellen Lopez\nWe wouldn't need to fill this role immediately I've worked at a school three years ago this happened where\nOne of the classrooms and have a teacher for three months and I'm seeing the impact that that had on my fifth graders currently so\nMaking sure that the ... a permanent substitute in there a para educator a certificate to stop from central office\nAnd ensuring that they're not alone in the classroom because this community has already been affected and when you throw in a new person without any support that's going to continue this process in the classroom there won't be but they won't be building community which is much needed [noise]\nUm I Would be periodically checking in in the classroom teaching myself if I have to [noise]\nUm and making sure that were being held accountable we are here to serve with our families and our students and\nChecking in constantly as what they need to ensure that we are here for that there should be no classroom without a teacher\nThank you\nI Want to remind everybody that if you have questions please write them down on a card there's some up here and waves them around um if you like to have them collected so they can bring them up for 'em that part of our evening [noise] the next candidate is Martin Rawlings fine\nSo um I I was starting to be a rabbi before the [laughter] so my porch might be a little different um I I was\nWhat's happening in the classroom go to school figure out what's happening really dive into it because you know without community\nReally nothing and I think it's really important that we have those connections I Would really love to to find out what's happening and then keep that communication line open\nThank you again do you see increasing as ... as if you're damn romantic priorities the priority and if so what is your plan for attracting and retaining more families\nAh the male love it please and also Alison we're going to have you with us too so\nThe city college we dealt with this huge enrollment crisis after four and a half years of our school threatening threatened with being shut down and so from first hand experience I Know how important is to build a robot from the ground up\nWhy don't we change the enrollments Eris was not this big scary thing when that just happened\nBut that we actually create opportunities to celebrate the arts and know showcased with students do in their schools you know bring you know there are tourists but let's maybe have hubs throughout the city where people can come and observe firsthand and talk to parents and families and and even the kids\nI think that we need to know do this in a systematic way to where the communities can be promoting their schools because they understand what the hidden gems are that are out there beyond the new specific toddler schools we can be very intentional about that and and central office needs to support this kind of homegrown effort\nYou Alison St grow simply um so I guess I just want to say that the student assignment system is always described as a lottery and I think that's really problematic because people win and they lose and I don't\nUm but unfortunately I mean there's Seventy schools in our district and most parents choose maybe ten to Fifteen of those schools and so it creates a high demand for small number of schools and so families in those neighborhoods\nHave a really hard time getting in and then there are families and the baby most of them leave\nTheir neighborhood some of that is because they feel like their schools are under resourced but there's also like a lack of information about some of the amazing schools in our district so number one I think we need to do a lot more to reach out to families I'm currently I have twins applying for high school nobody from central office has reached out to me to help me with this transition\nAnd we rely a lot on schools and a lot of parents to do a lot of its marketing work I think that's not fair because there are some schools that don't have parents who have that capacity those schools do get marketing and then we just continue the cycle of of\nThem being under resourced and I'm an an under enrolled so we need to really push up\nThe um marketing from the central office and in ... outreach and customer service and then we also need to fix some of our schools that really do need improvement\nThank you so much right the next question will be for Martin Monica and all that and it comes from the second district PTA what will you do to help families become more engaged in their children's education and we'll start with Martin plays\n\nSoftball for me I guess um [noise] how do we get parents weren't age ... how ... how many people are here to make it look around\nThere are parents who are here it's it's great\nBut we need to be filling the streets right we need to be bringing people in to potluck and\nIn ... in the interesting things uh PTA to putting on making things that parents want to come to um our our PGA or ... or to a great thing we started pairing you know learning\nWith food and socializing to PTA meetings\nAnd that was a really big draw and I think that's really important community you need to stick together and\nEach school needs to have a school board member come out to them every once in a while and people need to see those were members and the people from the district all the time and then you know them\nPart of that is treated engagement you got to get out there you got to reach out to parents who are applying to schools and really bring those people\nBack like thank you Monica\nAll right so first we have to create environment or our parents feel safe and they said well and\nAnd I know this is a challenge especially you know for English language learners or for community that have been impacted by racial trauma within our city due to being left behind and broken promises\nAnd so first it's on us as a as each school to create an environment so when new when new parents come in that there are things you know like mindset like a pot luck that the elaborate a pack is having an orientation meeting in a meeting with parents and a cultural sensitive way and especially I Know you know Latin American families there's a huge difference\nIn the way you engage with their schools and different countries and and so if you have families are coming from a different country to have to be talking about the culture like how how how you can get involved with child at the school you know um volunteering et cetera working with the teachers and especially when\nWhen ... students start is new school year is so important to build our relationship with the teacher so making sure each teachers taking that time to really get to know the parents getting to know the family so that parents feel safe and welcome to to engage\nThank you I got a phone call it like for the question so\nYou know uh I worked at birth in high school you know were there were two people in the PTA right and so when it comes off Pacific Islanders African Americans Latino live next families right\nHow do we increase parent engagement on that level as well right\nAnd so also for me what's important is there's a bunch of mothers in his room there's been a bunch of mothers all of these forums how do we engage products right how do we get father so we ... we created a father initiative and the hope is a public housing or seizing here in San Francisco to really start to get fathers back into the picture\nRight so those are things for me to the communication process right and so when we were in high school there on the verge closing down there at like eight hundred kids uh we did a a\nA parent engagement process and the communication process that was able to really pull parents in four years later the school went up by a foreign to kids for the kids' parents gave me it was about Ninety five percent you know just as simple as communication so Texans emails males in the mail\nEccentric thank you\nThank you write that next question is going to be for Phil Roger and lack and the question comes from support for families of children with disabilities\nDo you have personal or professional experience working with children and or you know that have disabilities or their families and if so what does that experience and if not how do you plan to serve this community\nBest and we'll start with Phil\nUm yeah when I was teaching um I was part of I ... process for several students of mine um and worked closely with our learning specialists and identifying the best way to the poor students I thought that we are legally not only legally required by also additional support services are provided\nA we've developed what we call ... teams at my school site where we are essentially brought handmade ... our teachers um and a special education teachers are parents caters into one room out for every single gene that we had our our caseload in our classrooms to talk about ways that we could we can support a moralistic lead a student [noise]\nUm and I know that a similar program exist here that if you're the as well I think it's really really important that we know ah that parents have a good understanding of what their rights are that are students are aware of a self advocacy and what that looks like and what that feels like and that teachers are also clear\nThat an IT is not a burden it's something that we use the better support our students are and how they actually go about leveraging their time to ah actually differentiate their lessons to better support students with special needs\nThank you Roger\nThank you um [noise] so I I have a little bit of experience in that my daughter does have a five oh for\nIt's not the same at a level of severity that many do but it gives me a hint of what the process is so that I can empathize with those who have gone through it [noise] um\n[noise] we need to support one of the things my kids are at their elementary school all three of them\nThe had the experience of\nThe special ed students the special ed class being included with the regular classes and all three of them made friends with children from the special day class and I will say that it was a huge benefit for my kids as much as for the other kids\nAnd I would make sure that that's continues that we include everyone a all students together and for benefit of all thank you\nThank you max said that for me\nIt's in director of the green street art center which was a partnership between a low income neighborhood action team Wesleyan University and the city where the colleges based and uh what part of my role was designing a curriculum and working with home school families and many of the families had students and had children with special needs\nAt the university hadn't really thought about what that meant before they started this program they needed to do more on the ground planning with parents so we were in a situation where my role was really to identify resources and training for the instructors and I did that very much led by the parents and what their needs and what their suggestions were\nAnd then when it comes to working with a family is in the school district\nI think you know two things I've heard one is uh that inclusion is very important", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "31"}
