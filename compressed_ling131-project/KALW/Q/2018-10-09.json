long Marianne famously raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows tower ups on I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just wanted to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his homes and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in this new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nI used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh\nThen we both wrote a look and look was always you put on a uniform to fight the civil war or tried to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for\nSo let's drink too when it's over and let's bring to when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they are used to be street wasn't all that do you see when you up and walked away\n\nBut all the that little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens had videos you will it through the night to ... says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's light\nSo that strength to when it's over unless strength to when we meet all be standing on this corner where\nThey used to be a street you're left me with the dishes or the baby in the back and you're tied\nWith the militias I knew where their their capital flowers will I guess that makes us equal but I Want to march with view or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's bring to when it's over unless strength to one way to meet\nYou know like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who is in my estimation become nostalgia acts there the subjects because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate him things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to it and they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works\nYeah that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I've always wanted to get on record as say what I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they are contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nOr that of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are imbedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nWell since you've declined to read more pounds that your father I Wonder if I remember reading about being ... tankers are in transit you know it's just it's a\nIt's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six\nAnd this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and lyrics so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely carrier June\nOn a shake my head in war robes and got up very early I hated everyone but I actor generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly through the ten thousand nights I spent a loan\nFrom a third storey window above the park deport you go I've watched the snow come down all day as usual there is no one here they're never is\nMercifully the inter conversation is canceled by the white noise of winter I Am news or the mind the intellect nor the silent voice with you that's also castles\nAnd now gentle reader in what name in whose name do you come to Idaho with me in these luxurious and twin ... realms of aimless privacy\nI think that home Adam gets a little about what you were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone and has entering his [laughter] yeah and during his solitude yeah\nAs you noted also a kind of humor you know half of the river a loved one of his lines where he says a few so good not to love you like I did it's like the tour away my blindfolded and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] is that those hilarious\nMy

father's most famous ads are already written in recorded by the time you were born Suzanne selling Marian had that's no way to say goodbye burn a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear him he didn't he didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and\nSingers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what is the son and who's singing it Mm um but but you are you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that song writing was a craft that's something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old uh on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language\nAnd um [noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me\nMe me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and I was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSandwich or move he says yeah\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel and\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise]\nWere you and your parents separated um five six from the don't remember so how much did you get to see your father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father would often even park a caravan\nUm he he's always been part of our lives feed always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation so ... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nOkay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things it put it to the tea where the road and met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people\nUm I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your father's savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression\nUm and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry um in incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work and with his devotion to black and white pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself\nAnd um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I was a festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities that suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for that economic crisis\nSo did he ever get the song
