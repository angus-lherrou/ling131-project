{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "In Ninety One point seven ... elderly San Francisco coming up next it's six o'clock is looking at education with Carol ... followed by the San Francisco Unified School district board meeting and deeply ... tonight at nine depending on how long the board meeting takes 'em that could be preempted this evening\nRight now it's six o'clock this is looking in education with kale kale kale Carol ... for ... ...\n[noise] this is Carol ... of our looking at education on K. A. L. W. and joining me as Jonathan Raymond who has written a really really interesting new book called the wildflowers a school superintendent ... challenged to America\nJonathan is the past superintendent of Sacramento\nA Unified School district and presently a president of the steward foundation and he has a very unique perspective on how to make our schools that are particularly emphasizing equity and empathy So Jonathan if\nIf you were talking to a new superintendent ... what what would be those words that you'd say like hears the vision we're looking at\n[noise] I'd say Carol first of all congratulations you've got the greatest job in most important job in America\nAre you've got the hardest job in America to\nAnd you can make a difference for children you can make a difference today you need to be bold you need to be courageous you need to be thoughtful you need to be a politician you need to have a really thick skin most important you got to have a hard for kids\nA heart for kids a lot of times the decisions that superintendents make are based on we've done it this way it's hard to change ah I don't have the staff to do it how do you get past those things\nYou really need to have a sense of who you are and what you believe in in other words you have to have a set of values\nAnd a vision and ultimately our shared vision or vision that you've developed with your with your stakeholders um we're really good at strategies to how we're not so good at why are we doing this and what do we hope to accomplish and achieve\nAnd when you have all that it keeps you on ...\nAnd sure when you're running a ... a school district like Sacramento we had\nForty seven thousand kids four thousand employees a lotta stuff happens every day that you have to react to so I understand that\nAnd I get it and you also need to stay on course and stay on focus on where you're going a vision and having a purpose and living and leading that way helps to keep it straight and going in that direction\nSo when we talk about having a vision a division as I cause I Know you\nAnd the vision is not a moving a piece of paper on the superintendents desk from the left side to the right side of making sure that everything is stacked up right ear vision really is is driven by going out and visiting schools talking to kids talking to teachers talking to parents and that's important isn't it\nIt's critical I Would tell folks if you want to see me don't come to my office because I'm not going to be there because I was out in the community I was out in schools\nI've told this story several times Carl when I went to Sacramento I didn't go there to green schools are necessarily change the way we fed our kids but when you're out in schools and you're meeting and talking to kids things happen\nRight and that's the thing about being a superintendent you have to make change\nI was visiting a school in a second grade classroom when students said superintendent why do we have Styrofoam trays in our classrooms and in our cafeteria is\nThat take fifty years to break down in a landfill my classmates and I bring our plates and flat we're from home\nWhat are you going to do about it exactly what are we going to do about it well in that case three months later we had biodegradable trays and that's my point if you want to learn and you want to listen and to be able to lead\nThe answers and directions come from outside the answers interactions come from in the community and the only way you'll know is if you're out there\nListening and then being willing to challenge and ask questions I was fortunate and a lot of ways that I didn't grow up in the education system\nI came from the outside so I just had different eyes and it's important not that my eyes are the only eyes but it's important you use the eyes and tools that you have\nAnd that you also build a team and surround yourself with folks can compliment your skills right\nSo that it's not a question of yes Mr superintendent um that's right or your people are telling you what they think you want to hear you need to know what you need to know and what you you need to hear then that's the good and bad and sometimes the ... the ugly but that's the only way change happens\nLet me are going to be leaving ... famously Unified School district court has been the meeting\nSuch as accessibility information for the public's section B. open an items um can I have a motion to the second for approval of the October night ... many minutes I'm not certain thank you as a reminder speaker cause for the regular meeting\n\nOkay ... he's with us though things [noise]\nIs that what you know and it's to mine yes thank you ... you know the doctor I see I missed Sanchez Mr walking yes yes it is for I\nThink you\nSpeak of cards for the regular agenda in for close session as to say if you wish to address the board of education members of the public a reminder that\nItem being

superintendents report Dr Matthew ... thank you president cook good evening everyone [noise] October\nIs national principles month I like to take this opportunity to personally think all of a hard

thing that would try to get across the community and as we advocate for school starts to get people understand\nAll of our schools the one common enough denominator for all of our strong schools is a strong parent community in a strong character community and so this is very important and I just appreciate the work of a pack over the years\nUh appreciate seeing the growth and I'm getting excited more and more every year the presentations common as we start seeing\nRepresent of why we put in place so thank you for all your hard work or in fact I just had a colleague a board of education from my desk to reach out\nRequest and information or to speak with a miss Irving about how they can start something like this in their school district and a lotta leaders across the state\nWill learn more about how to do this themselves and in their district so it's a testament to people seeing what's happening in the district and that continued focus that we have to support our families in our students um\nCertainly I just want to say that as we talk about the things that need to change here as we look at slight six\nIf we want to make sure that we get more of those items cost out\nPlease continue to push and hold us accountable as a district hold our leaders accountable continue to call out the things that are happening at the sites that are not working for our families that we need to bring attention to so that we can know what's happening a and a lot of you do that but just remember\nWe love to get information about what's not happening at the sites that needs to be followed up on the email or phone calls and everything we definitely don't want to wait until we get here and a lot of our parents and the audience\nUm are proactive by doing that but we just want to be mine for remind all of our families that all of our information is listed all we do respond because I Want to make sure that we are held accountable and at our site leaders are held accountable and our school sides are held accountable and then the third thing I just want to say I'm\nI was glad to see that we had a teacher and Willie Brown middle school that was one of the founding educators get honored tonight I'm because\nAs we continue to talk about the work that we're doing with our students and talk about the narrative\nPeople continue to try and find a narrative for black students in is if you are the and we won't let that happen we know we have work to do a nobody is trying to um\nTo downplay that part but there are a lot of good things happening and when things are moving in a positive direction we have to make sure that people also know that and understand that but I just appreciate all the work of a pack a continued growth in what's happening at all of our school sites and across the district\nIs evident and your success and how hard you work to make sure that our parents have voice across the district so thank you\n\nCommissioner ... ... how the height of\nSome excited I'm super excited I was pumped up off of the uh I really wanted to watch that video\nI'm I think um first and foremost you know the job you guys are you know our parents and I know to be here in a unique you know what your kids probably at home or and also doing this work for our communities are in school is not easy\nUh especially you know all I keep hearing was culture humility racism you know and to have to ... to navigate that\nThat as well as very difficult so I commend you guys for being able to step up and do the work that through these times um\n[noise] the narrative parts of me also very important right you have to do in a good job of pushing the narrative and to be able to create a new to new inside for people to be able to um\nTo kind of start to believe in and so ah as a school district board member um we are here to support a in whichever way possible and just continue to work like\n\nRussia Russia figure\nI found it to share that much and I get so much activity around the world [noise]\nDo every day uh your voice in El ... process has been really very important as well as um the inclusion of really brown and banned three I had a lot of folks ask 'em about\nI was very proud to forward to them uh the views of a pack as one perspective on that issue\nI threw the chair I'd like to request um I Know that the committee flag or ethnic studies is being an important component of this effort\nIf we could request a report on ethnic studies I'm In the curriculum committee needing I Know that can be sure not news not here tonight but if we could pass along the request to have a report on the status of ethnic studies about the district that curriculum committee\nAnd then just finally and I understand you have over twenty different sites with a packs active I Would love to see a map of that like which schools are active\nThen I'm moving forward see how that proliferate because I think that would be important to know which schools might need one and don't have one or with schools are already active so if I could replace that information to some of the stuff we keep\n\nPushing this yeah I Want to also appreciate the work of a pack in a you know I I I like I'm seeing you bring back issues that are we've made progress on and then also issues that we still need to make progress on I think that's\nReally effective an important and I hope we will see more and more issues crossed out as as time goes on a with that I didn't want to ask you maybe you could speak a little bit more about some of the progress on a curriculum in books that reflect our students and in the classroom and\nOn black history being celebrated uh I I Know that\nIt was just continue to be I I've I've heard still I'm a bit about it and I want to make sure that on you know black history being celebrated that we're doing a better job with that and\nMaybe you know if you could speak to some of the progress that you've seen on both of these issues and I'm sure even though it's crossed out you know some of the work that still needs to be done\n\nThat we continue to partner with the schools heights we actually think this past year I saw some of our best I'm African American history are black history month celebrations and we actually attended as many as we possibly could to show support for it\nUm we continue to provide our schools I flip the tool kit and to offer any assistance that we can so that they know what it looks like in um how to put on a black history month celebration is to make sure that they have\nAll the resources that they possibly can as far as the books that I think each individual school site um specific and that knowledge I don't have right now but I can definitely do research and get back to you guys to see if that um the dynamic has changed in some schools\nWill the ground up prices near and dear to my heart is you know I can say that our library is great but that's the only one that I have knowledge at right now\nThank you yeah and and it'd be great to know you know from from our staff um some of the strategies that we have on that to\nUh make sure we're providing information and support the schools on both of those on those points um [noise] I uh there were two other things that I wanted to fly you know I see on here a more black teachers and staff\nAnd I think that'd be something that would be important to bring forward onto the personnel a committee and learn more about some of our strategies and how they're working at some of the progress and look at the numbers there I think\nI also wanted to I I Know that there are some folks here tonight we're going to speak about\nSome of the ways in which we've begun to move backwards on a ... school climate and as the discipline related issues and he spoke a little bit about um [noise] um you know the the bias and versus the escalation and\nHow we're doing that so I Hope that you all are very much at the center of that conversation at the table working with our staff to make sure that we can make progress on supporting all of our students and not pushing our students out\nUm we were very concerned to see some of the numbers that came in front of us on\nA backtracking on a school discipline numbers and I'm On absenteeism as well so um those are a huge concern to us and we we we spoke about it I'm In the last word meaning but I Want to make sure that we're working very closely with you all and and trying to do better on those things and in respect to the people were here tonight or to also speak out on that", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018",
