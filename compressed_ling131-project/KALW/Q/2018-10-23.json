impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by Lee Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress too little bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cats that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker Edna fervor no coward and\nThe actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors reviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secrets jak hawk a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet and numerous scams in hospitals jak is played by Richard II grand each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nThat wants to all my friends with the [noise]\nFind myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from\nLaw school to do some ... ... I mean [noise]\nDocuments [noise]\nBeautiful dream\nLiterary letters writers\nLittle tricks lawn mowers\n... if you're not understanding the world of elite\nCollectible literary artifact ... ... pieces of paper that go with servers\nI Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nVisit was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the wrong because I get a better response\nWas to be told reporters [noise]\nThat's the only one without [laughter]\nMelissa McCarthy welcome to fresh air I Love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nBut I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nUm I think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dress yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it okay and then ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of injected into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone Brazil data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause you did feel like for lack of a better way to terminate ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny\nYou watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with them the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter]\nWithin to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended it\nWas really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you are so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and they think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults [laughter]\nInsulting oh no [laughter] not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra our on our kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he well he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language learning how to relate what they do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like you're a big commercial couple\nNone of this talk if productive I Would like to read and my legs and kick you vote in a jar with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I Will shoot through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll of the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it and just go back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being ...\nI Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] and never say that and the first time a sitting with ... said for watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... internally have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nEspecially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character you know you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\n[noise] there is a fun too I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nAnd I guess as Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new

I. E. A.\nDot org [noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like took your\nOff [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking\nBut every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shut them now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person's film Barris that they stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think some more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I would've flashes like ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a old my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you're you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know at all of the day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of\nMaking these three dimensional flawed you know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect\nClothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like\nAre filled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for a female character was really bland and and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come the woman to go like\nCar all [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and save the guy's name I'm like why didn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate than meaningful for you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more\nEmpowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just ... you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in real life your strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue\nUh just your dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer trend literary forge or after a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard\nAssigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nNew in New new ...
