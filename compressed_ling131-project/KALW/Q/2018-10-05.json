air\nAnd Terry Gross last week Facebook announced him a serious security breach in the company's history and like an unknown hacker was able to log on to the accounts of at least Fifteen million Facebook users but that's just one element of the crisis facing the world's largest social media platform\nThey stuck with the conduit for Russian backed disinformation campaign and the twenty sixteen election that reach tens of millions of users\nAnd the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica got access to the personal information of eighty seven million Facebook users which they used to target messages for the Trump campaign\nFacebook is now under investigation by the FBI the securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade commission and authorities in Europe and Australia\nOur guest New Yorker staff writer Evan asking us explore space but history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine\nHe says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach has jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled go send the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air Steve Davies\nWill Evan us welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years since it was founded in two thousand for\n[noise] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings\nLot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting a get connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with him\nWell he did it I should say reluctantly um you know this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this for a big powerful company um\nAnd I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it except the idea that\nTo an extraordinary degree mark soccer breed is Facebook I mean that is the reality he's the chairman he's the c._e._o. he owns\nControls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and end with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore\nYou know you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and [noise]\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to the uh uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize them at the time but over time eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond his comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had a civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being\nBold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm [noise] he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people said that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\n[noise] a ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively transparent in order 'em\nTo be modern this the sense was as one person that put it um [noise] you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and they're they're monitoring their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world\nNow almost like redefining what it is to be human ah [noise]\nYeah they believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic sense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building\nIs shaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly [noise] there was a recent data breach at Facebook where\nFifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers were hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million ... Facebook user accounts or Facebook also\nI'm to be safe or took another forty million users and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nOf the account so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could postings on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightened the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied the history of fish what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would if they would've\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they\nHad to talk about this breach or really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as its answer at this point\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies recorded with ... a staff writer for the New Yorker I've noticed this article about Facebook is titled ghosts and the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy\nWe'll hear more of the interview after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nThe new by our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from the law firm who we are well pay with offices in the U.S and Europe and China\nCruelly advisors entrepreneur as investors financial institutions have established companies around the world where innovation me the law and from CBS TV [noise]\nCandice Bergen returns to CBS has Murphy Brown candies is joined by the original casting and\nThe show's creator Diane English new episodes of Murphy Brown premiere tonight on CBS\nFollowing your favorite Opinionator is on Twitter does not make for a balanced political died joined me Josh Barrow and our political experts from left right and center it's your weekly supplement sort of self contained opinion bottles that dominate today's media to each week we delve into politics policy in popular culture in a civilized get provocative way finished the first half\nThe envy the on the left right and center here on K. A. L. W. and San Francisco department\nAt elections is looking for poll workers for the November ... election a poll workers would be a sad thing for their service if you'd like to learn more you can visit the poll workers recruitment office at city hall between nine and four pm Monday through friday or you can go to U. S. S. elections dot O. R. G.\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were and\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a\nIt is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that uh from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so the company was in big trouble ... Berg\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how to do\nWell there is a lot riding on that appearance or you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\nHe in some ways vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point Orrin Hatch senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads it was such an obvious fact to anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you can just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back\nOver and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye Korea or you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this [noise]\nBecome this consuming effort a Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaking one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads now we are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than\nNot only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for an end who were they targeting um they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shake elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials or are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so ... Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation it'll announced it will say we took down a group of\nRussian I'm In pastors who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions about what what the public season would have doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices ... take for example the you know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when is somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers probably\nThose kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in conference rooms at Facebook and it's very complicated\n[noise] Evan us most is a staff writer for the New Yorker whose piece the ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook appeared in recent issue we'll talk some more after a short break this is fresh air\nAn extra cost around ... one of my seventeenth anniversary of the U.S led invasion of Afghanistan according to the Iran more than ten thousand civilians were killed or injured and twenty ...\nThat number is expected to be even higher at this year so star for the future at war torn country also just off the upcoming are taken from Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court China ... and ... that's tomorrow morning at ten am\nBack in Nineteen Ninety to a big celebration was plans to mark the\nFive hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus was a rival in the Americans buy American indian activists in American indian people just said enough with this Columbus craft enough with\nThis happy indigenous people's day this week so I'm a media from WNYC and that friday night at the end\nOf a of a ... [noise]\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with Evan Austin's he's a staff writer for the New Yorker his story ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook appears in a recent issue of the magazine they recently took down a posts from Alex Jones of infowars you want to tell us that ...\nThis was a really an important case study in how Facebook skin to deal with its most complicated problem in some sense which is content what are you simply do with the fact that people are posting a billion items of content to Facebook every day that's the actual number and [noise] what\nBeach we're going to prevent hate speech from being on here um but for things that are less than hate speech if it's just misinformation or things that appear to be wrong by accent well then we're not going to ban that person from Facebook we're going to try to use other tools we may make their posts less visible we might share the last\n... but the case of infowars which as we all know is a conspiracy website led by Alex Jones and [noise]\nFor years it has promoted in particular the false but it's a false conspiracy theory that that the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school was a stage it was a hoax and it was designed to try to advance in the anti gun agenda that's the theory and", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "05"}
