{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "This is Carol cause of are looking at education on K. A. L. W. and I met Herbert Hoover middle school here in San Francisco and I am in\nSomething that hasn't existed in many many schools\nIt's a sort of a techie studio where kids are going to learn leadership skills and how to help other kids use technology ah their wires their computers are cameras a it's something that when my kids went to Hoover they couldn't even dream that this existed\nJoining me are Melissa died who's the chief technology officer of the San Francisco Unified School district and fad Austin who is a technology learning coach fantastic\nSo Melissa a chief technology officer what's the plan\nSo NSF USD our mission is to ensure that each and every student can thrive in the twenty first century\nAnd we do that through high quality instruction and equitable support and we can't do either of those without technology\nSo within our vision for the district we call it vision twenty twenty five we have a graduate profile and that includes the skills and competencies and behaviors we want each and every kid to graduate from ...\nSo that includes leadership empathy and collaboration real life learning developing a digital identity and so technology is foundational to that\nSo within the district we have a digital district plan that's really the the pathway to help us get to that destination a vision twenty twenty five\nSo what's happening here at Hoover is a great example of that\nAnd the district has a partnership with digital promise and ... it's called the rise and innovative learning schools program we have three middle schools where every middle school student has uh an eye pad for to support their learning\nUm they take the pat home so it comes with a data plan for them because we know that some ... families don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd students are using that technology within across all of their content area is um and they have a real world learning opportunities like the digital media center here like the ...\nAnd how they can access content acts create and and\nReally demonstrate what they learn leveraging technology so that's what we want to see those are the experiences that we want for each and every one of our students so you have it at three schools who have it at\nAnd we have it at a time in middle school Roosevelt middle school and here at Hoover middle school\nAnd we also have a number of other ones one programs and our middle grades\nAnd and we focused on middle school it's actually part of the city's a stamina leadership initiative that started under um mayor lead and and to our partnership with sales force as well so this is for the next generation of that is we're looking to bring to really have a\nA real life rich deep learning that's enabled by technology for ... and so\nOne of the things that that that she she mentioned as you talk about technology but you're also building skills leadership skills empathy relationships\nUh sometimes people think of technology is all you're just you know sitting in front of a computer and you you you don't have any personal interaction but that's far from what's happening\nRight right uh well one of the fears about technology coming into into our schools is that is somehow going to replace or substitute for the teacher and that's that's never going to be the case nothing can replace a the relationship building and the leadership of skills building that you get with people interacting with each other\nUm yes teachers are moving more from a top down instruction standing it went into the room a ... teaching rote memory skills to facilitate ... um\nBut with that comes more opportunity I Believe to build relationships with their students and to afford them the opportunity to build relationships with each other like they've never had before\nAnd I think and one of the reasons I when I was offered this role um a couple of years ago three years ago\nUm was exciting to me was uh being able to\nUse the technology we're getting to a leverage that technology towards that goal of having students get those opportunities to build relationships with each other to communicate better with each other and one of the one of the fears I've heard and had\nIs that the technology is going to divide students ah isolate them from each other and their teachers I don't see that happening if it's not if it's not used properly that can happen\nWe have to go to the ... school district board meaning they've started their meeting already\n... thank you so miserable you know yes thank you Mr my yes Mr Hany yes a tumor I see I missed Norton yes Mr Sanchez

Carmichael but a vista Horace Mann Everett James diamond James Lick MLK visit valley\nOkay so you know if they're an additional fifty students from all around middle school they're admitted under ban three\nThat's almost half of demand three admissions for low on a given year that's going to crowd out students from other neighborhoods and other parts of town and it may actually decrease racial and ethnic diversity alone so I think this policy needs to re works\n\nGood even I'm I'm Jon Corzine a a president of the law alumni association I'm proud profoundly disappointed or to be before you tonight not so much in opposition to this proposal which are urging\n... and the commissioners Hany and ... said at a meeting would definitely have to happen with the two schools involved it hasn't happened\nI wrote them half of the law alumni association each member of the board so Britain and other staff would get back then they didn't do it super ... supervisor tang has written to the board no response this is an important proposal our students expect more students should have more students of the entire district\nAnd this is this is a proposal uh that does not need rushing banned three schools are not identified until march there's no need to rush this\nTonight without the appropriate consultation from the two schools in from the larger community\nAnd not considering what the Lola associations recommending which is a robust comprehensive mentoring program\nCould start with ... will around middle school as a pilot but certainly all of us all the students are doing cruise diversity outlaw all the students and middle schools should have access to Arab us comprehensive mentoring program that we would like to be a part of\nThat as as as Mr a bad mention uh this proposal short changes\nDiverse students from other schools who have under under under the proposal have to have a recommendation from their principal\nThere is no such requirement for students from one school to have a recommendation from their principal that they will thrive at law we think this is this is important\nBecause the way this is set up and it's all in the details are which I Hope you are familiar with this proposal would permit students who have the staples average or below fifty percent or a either one of those uh to to be admitted law automatically\nThis confusing language or what it means qualifying for admission and what means recommended for admission you can do better we can do better together we wanted to be able to have a strong proposal it increases diversity of law and there's somebody that we can be proud of for our middle school students and for our city thank you [noise]\nAnd before next week or star Sims when it called a few more we have after a supervisor Katie thing round about\nTo St Louis Leakey\nEvery June ... Virginia Marshall\nEvening commissioners Dr ... my name is ... and I was born and raised in San Francisco where I currently work as a civil rights attorney I appreciate the opportunity to make public comments in support of the changes ... admissions policy\nFor too long at USC has allowed ... to operate as an exclusionary island separate and apart from the other schools in our city\nIs unacceptable that San Francisco schools including law are racially segregated because we know racial segregation campers individual and collective student achievement for all students\n[noise] the board previously said that its priorities for redesigning so you can achieve and that includes are ceding Simon excuse me included wine reverse in the trend of racial isolation and the concentration of underserved students in the same school and to providing equitable access to the range of opportunities offered to students [noise]\nImproving roles admissions process is the first step towards achieving these purported goals\nI support allowing eighth graders from Willie Brown middle school who has met the bans three threshold to qualify for admissions that little\nWill rebound middle school has one of the largest populations of African American students in the city and if the bored surely wants to provide equitable access to underserved students you need to meet them where they are and that means creating a path from really found that will school\nHas one and just some of the concerns that other people have said it about whether students from Willie Brown belong at an academically oriented high school like law whether they can be retained after admissions before I was a civil rights attorney I taught eleventh grade us history\nYou can excel academically when they have teachers who hold them to high expectations and who create meaningful relevance and rigorous curriculum\nThese amazing teachers exist throughout assets USC but especially at law which has some of the highest concentrations of veteran teachers with deep knowledge and its extensive experience teaching AP courses [noise]\nThis is precisely why increasing the number of underserved students Clinton students from the bay view at all is so important for far too long or best schools have excluded the students who are most in need of the best education thank you so much for your consideration of changing the law missions policy [noise]\n\nGood afternoon board um my name is ... bracket and I am in a\nPrevious alumni of local high school I also attended role in the nineties when they had their step to college program which was also a successful program that help students who were in what is now regarded as banned three be successful at low and they not only were successful we graduated at higher rates than before\nSo I'd like to just be clear about what's happening today what's happening today is that we have a culture outlaw that has always had a racial disharmony there's always been um certain staff members as well as alumni who was pushed or prevented\nThe rest of the district from knowing what exactly what's going on at the school and has not protected black and brown students or a PI students at local high school that is why most of the students are having issues while they're at low academically because motion leave their stunted from growth\nSo beyond that I'm I'm very concerned about what the statements have been today so we're surrounding that she wouldn't have black and brown students already meet that threshold\nAnd the desire of our alumni association to put up very racist Trump like rhetoric say that these black students are not capable of being able to compete with other students that are also in private schools for me in that same sixty four points threshold and might\nAdd let me read off some of the names of some of these private schools so that we are clear about that it's not just public schools as they try to mislead you and the previous statements so I'm going to go up and read that if you can give me one moment\n\nThe names of the schools are this ...\nThe boys coverage of the Sacred Heart the\nLack of cat and social\nSan Francisco ...\nAnd macular conceptual St Brendan\n\nSuit in a bar the handling stored hard for boys these these are the schools that are actually going in and have special admissions to ban three right now\nSo to say that a public school in our district should not qualify under that is disgusting but can you please [noise]\n\nEvening commissioners I Can't eat hang here I guess I'm coming here with different hats on one is a proud graduate of our San Francisco Unified School district uh my other role as a as a policymaker who listens to a lot of parents talk about a school issues and so forth [noise]\nAh but I can hear you might think that just because I graduated from all that time here to try to preserve the admissions process\nTo try to have some people might uh try to catch characterize as trying to keep it segregated that is completely not the case I share your goal and wanting to make law a diverse school and wanting to make sure that everyone from every community succeeds when they attend will and that they can get into all\nUm and so I I Want to phone in on one particular point uh that\nI Am opposed the policy is not because of the goals that we're all trying to achieve it because I Want to see more discussion and more in terms of how we're going to evaluate whether what you're going to be doing will actually make a huge impact on the middle school students that want to attend ... for example I Want to know\nWhat criteria were going to use what metrics\nUm how do we know that uh maybe if this policy does succeed or do we need to adjust it readjust do we need to\nThink about other ways I'm actually even tonight I heard some ideas that I think will be good in terms of starting with younger students to make sure that they're supported not just have to middle school level but even at the elementary school level to ensure\nThat they can uh have\nA a great success that again getting into schools like ... but even also other schools are in er San Francisco Unified School
