self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's\nBased on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud\nSuzanne crab and David Barstow are two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to passes vast fortune onto his children\nDoes and Craig writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president nor his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air attach a pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had to build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes you're by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers are actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing whose homes were she built in his apartment buildings which we build him\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're coming is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens of his uh and so we had known the skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAnd especially with the return of the jeers from World war two if you would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to build middle class housing and so at his peak this was a guy who\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is

and David Barstow two of the three writers who report in just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald\nTrump engaged incest backpacks schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred tromp Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to us\nA very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans now one million I'm In today's dollars of ... two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw what is important also is the ... in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to dad and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father yeah\nIf you use the money for many of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history\nIn Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in doubt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire\nAnd end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nIt also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is the time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino traps and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of with ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well sexually and do well and it was caught a soldier that will it's taken ...\nWe seize this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and a\nNew caught us all within months has dropped to that removes Donald was the sole executor from Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new Willis dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father his dog for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end Fred Trump's live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that for Trump perceived to this is an attempt to bring 'em to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne ... after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of

Frank contracts don't own at that time of his death out there are also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to\nThe children they included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much all empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York development ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down as Donald Trump me it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of their tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings you made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning to the ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nAvoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more of the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David order to come back [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise] oh well\nSee if he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes of this story of his sort of\nMark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the bat it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might not happen in two thousand and\nFour I'm right is the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nForward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents hop and it gets really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three report is working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go you know [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and\n[laughter] and ... but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's pretty messy [laughter] I don't like a little ride them there and\nI and it'll cost her father too I Would imagine [laughter] and then other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery\nUh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it says and Craig David Barstow thank you so much\nComplaint you thank you Suzanne ... and David Barstow or reporters for the New York times article reported with Russ Buettner about the suspect tax schemes used a transfer of wealth from Fred Trump to his children was published earlier this month in the New York times magazine\nComing up can tackle reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas at the concert were shooter opened fire on the audience is is fresh air", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19"}
