Anderson an actor Daniel Day Lewis\nThey know it was only twelve when he had a part in the Broadway revival of inherit the wind starring George C Scott\nThey know also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy now the age of thirty four he directed his first film called wildlife\nThe screenplay which dino co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name wild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and\nHe's looking to his parents for a sense of home and stability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet meanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to joined the men fighting fire\nWhich leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone and that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives\nHere's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father

[noise]\n[noise] well they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air so that this film was adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with it\n[noise] um I was a fan of Richard forwards I just wrote a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called ... court which is which is now closed looking for another book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nOr even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not my I'm going to make a film but Wilder's book is for me\nAnd sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Paul dino he probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he directed his first film at an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too will be back\nAfter a short break ...\nAll\nThe\n...\nThis is fresh air and if you're just\nJoining us make guesses Paul Dana a great actor\nWho's films include there will be blood love and mercy Little Miss sunshine he's in the new Showtime series called escape at Dannemora\nAnd he directed his first feature film and it's called wildlife it's adapted from Richard Ford novel at the same name\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance in this year you're a teen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to get as much of the oil\nAnd you and he become antagonist and in in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis is Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another uh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWith a sheer well wishes for celebration or ... or\nOr ... he was\nA truly I'm going\nTo be damage All right\nYou're on the knees\n\n\nWhat do you want me to [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and ... and ... but you have also brought your bad habits as a badge lighter you last year to after women and you have a\nBand in your child is your child that you raise your band in all because she was sick and us in just said now I Am a sinner should say it loud I ever since I'm a student\nLoan Daniel I'm a I'm a center I I'm\nSorry hold on shore lord I watch law and applaud you abandon your child\nOr the bugs and much I Will never backslide whenever it was last for now I'm\nOn my ...\n...\nBut I'm much Shay it loud oh\nOh oh\n\nWe get on your give me the number that you know what do you watch that Jesus Christ lord I save your do\n\nThe rules\nWow [laughter] I suppose you know and Daniel Day Lewis in a scene from the two thousand seven film there will be blood I'm actually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul ... character like slapping the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis a\nAlso getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up earlier in in the film that that's seen as almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know no time for me\nI I'm I was sort of cast the last minute mess and I started about four days after\nThe preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why those two characters became became twins were they not ... ... they were just brother and they're just brother and you know that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I said I suppose so but you know ... sort of sort of why it was going back there is is just listen to that clip you know gave me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the the two days before I started\nSpending on up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um\nBeautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn\nThe script and make contact with the the the the character and in in in this empty church I I don't know why that is when I went back to\nLose your idea to to learn your part while sitting in the church\nWhen I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how one day one is Monday and okay I'm going to go to the church and learn like [laughter] you know it seems um [noise] it's funny because that quip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seeing me film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider maybe some kind of master shop and uh\nI I slapped Daniel as you said in towards the end scene and\nI think we were supposed to once we get to that part just stop you know 'cause we're we're going to be doing this all day and and I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop and I went oh God\nUm and I think I ... I even had a little bit of rent on time and you know\nOh my God what does that and he just said\nYou know and I was like okay [laughter]\nMy guest is Paul dino he co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife we'll talk more after a break and you hear about what it's like to be beaten up and films including and there will be a blood\nAnd Kevin White had will review a new reissue of music Nino wrote a composed for Federico Fellini movies and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\nAnd you know our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and it's a commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah widely Christina Hendricks and Andrew ran on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professional for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nEmmy winning music supervisors Susan Jacobs elevates films like American Hustle and TV series like sharp objects by curing them with the perfect so music as a lot more than just some background thing in the restaurant or some ... some video it plays a huge important role\nSusan Jacobs later on sound [noise] flooding o'clock\nThis evening on Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco [noise]\nShe lives of a new shows said without music life would be a mistake high I mean one doing the door of Africa mix with it when the Congo soon in terms of even begin to up nine pm for an evening of music\nFor example to music from Africa and the African diaspora including voices of Africa the hospital runs on KLW Ninety One where I've been a cure a W adopt or\nYou know and we found that totally I ... yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you to quit not Brian or a guy named area and his in his bad um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd sing with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Brian is his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolution\nYou know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that I don't listen to him often because it really sends a chill through me and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess as actor Paul ... who is now also director Paul day no his directing debut is an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife in the movie\nIs also called wildlife we'll be right back\nThis is fresh air\nAnd hello I'm Jeff Hayden tonight on your legal rights San Francisco attorney elemental them from the form of ... attorney general ripping over will just stuff employment law as it relates to public employees and we will once again operate our poll lawyer feature right here at KLW on or off might get to walk you through your case from beginning to end\nWe'll be right here to answer your questions that your legal rights\nTonight at seven o'clock right here on K.
