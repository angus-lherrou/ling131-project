Terry Gross the federal government under President Trump is the subject of the new book ... risk by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of liked to fire on to me is what I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at at every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody to Britain in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise it's managing all these ... ... it imagines but we as a society to spend much time thinking about um it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought\nWhat happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and ... you would you what happens is you\nYou amplify the wrists you increase the probability of\nFresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like we're a society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a tree we had a prize the site it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn in his collected Ross and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving stored and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another\nTrouble toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening as a department that a lot that kind of level of government where things are being done my positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\n... and people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in a sense we ask the kind of spam includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli\nNoah first of all what they're doing and the Commerce Department [laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service titled National Weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked\nOff and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance so it's there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions service\n[noise] well I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut the weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them\nAnd I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property\nOr if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place if the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over is the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon ... is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with a government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America\nWorking to outsmart cancers for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed hospital treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision guy to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions with a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nDirect dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nNancy playwright Mary Robinson was the first woman president of Ireland then the un high commissioner for human rights now she's a fulltime climate activists this week on indeed she brings us her new book full of heroes climate Jeff\nIndeed with Angie couldn't stand nine PM Iran hail to have you with the line and Kepler stocks\nIf your company participates in matching give programs you can ask each our department had a ...

A. L. W. dot O. R. G. and thank you so very very much for your sport\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions too\nWere those departments so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between\nThe undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who were studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that it is a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or no one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one and a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I ... the society doesn't feel it caught him into ... shows you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis which you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nEnd world markets [noise]\nWell I'm a big question\nThe question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but no it's not my job but you know if I ...\nI Would love to have one ... outlandish production on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a war way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis uh\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things were were ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh

that's on tonight at eleven thirty right here in Ninety One point seven ...\nMm\nIn and\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything ... subs down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it's just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and\nI'm so lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nMy God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department\nAnd I try to having exactly the same experience the political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconceptions but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like\nUm this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have cut up contempt vague contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be briefed and ... you know it'd be kind of informed about these people I did not expect to be inspired by them the kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is\nUh there there 'cause they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids that people in the department of energy storage us about a passion for their particular size since they were little kids\nThey essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and if there's something\nReally moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing for money but from mission\nUh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off the page I mean it jumped it jumped into my mind to dealing with a minute or so I came away from it thinking wow\nI Can't believe we as a society of treated the this slice of our society these kinds of people who are really the best among us as badly as we have and", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "San
