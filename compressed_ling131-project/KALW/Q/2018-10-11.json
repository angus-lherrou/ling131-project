wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything for a better choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering if like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think I'd be the same sort of initial ah you know it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the Maddox terrain at least two\nWhiplash and low end and and ah but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to destroy the extremes of human experience out in space\nAh and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see often that you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that would sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meet sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that then then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaky will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nDid anybody throw up sooner Horton question [laughter]\nIran to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting gas out from we we have to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience I've seen this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this was freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of would augment the downs you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the death of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n... um and so you know they basically sending astronauts off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they don't masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and uh was sort of the you know the the sort of getting on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGearing Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given but in a way to capture late in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the ...\nThe er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent to that speech was\nBut yet also the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut knew if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nAre live their lives in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people

one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess his game inches al he directed the new movie first man and wrote and

[noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing and my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon or things what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and um [noise] what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like\nIf I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having\nThat kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\n[noise] I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned the Jim Hansen's book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and so the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know ah who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOh the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\nNo no [noise]\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon entity is in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of directed la la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on ... land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man er and er so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during and after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nA fell in love with that and and and winter Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut as soon as Eileen was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and during a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal with like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real sad and then miniatures\nIt's it's it's you know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like that can be difficult in a in a whole other level\nI mean I think everything you described gave me a lot of a ... a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they wouldn't see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to ...\nTo you know really get a ride and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned Oh thank you so much for attacking us that's been great to
