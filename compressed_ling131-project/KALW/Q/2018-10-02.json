he's a quid vacated\nIn spite of the evidence presented by American intelligence agencies and journalists when other reporters who has broken stories that have revealed new information to the public about that interference and about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia is my guest Greg Miller\nHe covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nIt's a chronological narrative connecting many of the most important stories on this subject and adding new reporting to those stories\nGreg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um stories are obviously many stories of the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote a story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved in include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election what was that was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders are we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nThat start with the Flint store I guess that had really direct consequences Flynn was fired so when was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had cause with the Russian ambassador to the U.S surrogate Kislyak\nTelling Kislyak that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions to like don't worry about it uh the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these calls happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration of right so how did how did you get onto that how did you start investigating this story\nWell I'm you know so\nAfter the post reported that there are about this secret CIA conclusion that Russia had in fact sought to help elect Donald Trump had had essentially had a candidate in the race\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting carts actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was a ... that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll taxing more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter\nBrad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll be right back ...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] and\n\n[noise] in in in the ... and and and\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and\nIt kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration\nTo impose new you right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no such immunity I was interested in that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very kind of controversial in the journalism world because line implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing that is that's worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more false woods from this president since he's taken office many\nOf them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff to um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about a times earlier in his career when he would adopt\nPhony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a there is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about what who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone writes a ... there was digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact and it just struck me at that time\nThat he was you know he was trying to throw sand and our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him and that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nAnd has written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll talk more after a break and TV critic David being clearly will consider how the season premiere such Saturday Night live and sixty

I'm not going to cost and not and I'm an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really him in a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources\nUm for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources we would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I wouldn't really say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know I Believe in telling you the information\nThat's absolutely right these sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing\nSo sometimes you might be asked well what does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically describe their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be but\nIt's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and and the and we do make mistakes\nBut boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations\nThis moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to\nThe broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe recording environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress release the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump Everytime he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a memo to record what ... what had transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but\nTrump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nCombing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving\nIt make you afraid well let me let me ... ... ... it whether it made me afraid I ... I was confident enough\nMy ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't\nWorried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it and our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail\nAnd he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um we're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to\nFulfill the role that the founders envision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission Miller thank you\nThank you Greg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the subversion of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nAfter we take a short break TV critic David being Cooley will consider how the season premiere of Saturday Night live and sixty minutes covered last week's Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings this is fresh air\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
