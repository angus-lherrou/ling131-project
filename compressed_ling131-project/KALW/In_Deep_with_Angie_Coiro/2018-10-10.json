{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "That part is KLW San Francisco nine o'clock is the time time for indie with as you stay tuned to local public radio KLW San Francisco\n\nI'm Angie Clara and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic\nThe phrase identity politics is becoming a slur it scoff at the issues groups down by race gender or other factors work to push into the mainstream some people do still use it impartial any\nPolitical scientist and political economists Francis Fukuyama splits the difference he does golf it when he calls identity ... American sub groups who he says put their own identifying characteristics above America's unifying principle\nBut he sees the critical importance of me too and black lives matter which others dismiss it's a fascinating nuance to take Frank's looking on his Nineteen Ninety two book the end of history and the last man for told the ultimate success of liberal politics a prediction badly challenge today\nHe's director of the center on American democracy development and the rule of law at Stanford chairman of the American interest and now the author of identity that demand for dignity and the politics of resentment\nFrancis Fukuyama joined me before a live audience campers broke from Menlo\nI got an email this morning and it was the public relations pitch there's a guy who is offering\nTwenty five thousand dollars for information on the personal history and character of the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh mhm and I thought to myself geometry it is the wrong not to tell me not to identify [laughter] I don't think you're telling me know identify as we now in us\nTell me what the proper role of identity as of identify as an Italian American ministers bisexual left hander whatever what's the appropriate role of that which relation to American society where does it fit\nSure so everyone of us feels that we have an inner identity that's not always respected and recognized by the society around us\nAnd I think for me too movement and what's been going on a with women in this country is an example of that so\nWomen have dignity but the way men treat them doesn't you know respect that dignity and we're going through this massive cultural change where men's behavior basic all that's the structure of all these identity movements says that the inner person is is right and the surrounding societies wrong and that's the\nStruggle that we're going through the cultural struggle we're going through right now and that is a necessary thing it's very important that that happened I mean black lives matters you know they're really big you know social justice movement going on the concern that I have is that\nWell it's a couple of things I mean one is that it's it's now triggered or been accompanied by a rise of a very nasty kind of identity on the right\nWhere you have a walking back I think of the kind of civic identity that we Americans thought we achieved in the wake of the civil rights movement\nWe have unfortunately got a president who I think it's basically a racist I mean\nHe you know uses every opportunity to exacerbate these conflicts of racial and ethnic conflicts she uses you know the identity frame that I represent you you're not recognize your\nYou know the elites don't care about you and it stokes a lot of anger and so the total result of that is a great deal of polarization which I think is the single biggest political problem we face in this country and we can make decisions on really basic things because we are\nThat is is that exclusive focus on on these identities\nWhen you talk about identity politics you mentioned ISIS we talk about the white nationalist hanging over their race has been decorated we talk about black lives matter whose primary objective is not to be shot mhm clearly they have different values and different reasons chilling didn't\nDo you have a different in Tempe and trying to get us to identify which identity arm beneficial to the country which are not\nNo so I think in a democracy obviously you want social justice and you want people to be recognized but I think the the reason that I I think that there's something in common is the psychological structure\nWhy is it that people these young guys go off to fight for ISIS first of all a lot of them are European Muslims or they don't feel comfortable in their parents' traditional religion they don't feel accepted by European society\nAnd what you know Islam is does is it says I'll tell you exactly who you are you're Muslim you're part of this rumor and we Muslims all around the world are being killed\nDisrespected and oppressed and this is your moment to be able to fix a exercise some agency and go fight back and I think it's that search for community and\nYou know knowing who you are and uh believing that you know you're part of a community with dignity the psychologically\nI was just saying now obviously you know somebody that goes on shops to head off of people or you know the sorts of terrible things I've been doing is not the same thing as somebody seeking you know equal rights in the United states but\nBut there is you know I think a common a psychological frame which really does have to do with this inner desire for dignity and anger when you don't receive respect\nYou actually go into definitions and analyses of words that you would think would be that in and I think the way that you went into what dignity years really mean when we say dignity\nIt's change that's one of the biggest shifts in in in times so in\nThe pre modern world dignity was not due to everybody was basically do the warriors you had an aristocratic class or they hatch status and nobody else did because they're the ones that risk their lives and you know in in battle I think that\nHistorically in the west of Christianity played a big role in shifting the basis of dignity to something more universal so Martin Luther says you know\nUh all of us have the capacity inside us for for grace which is the inter person which is the source of human dignity or if you actually it's interesting if you look at the use of the word dignity in constitutional language there quite a number of constitutions in Germany and South Africa in Japan\nThat preserve a right to dignity historically that enters actually through Christian Democratic parties or in Europe beginning with the Irish Constitution in Nineteen thirty seven and so\nThe religious understanding of universal dignity you know this this is something we all have a as as God's Children get secular rise in the course of the Eighteenth Nineteen centuries to be something that we now recognize as universal human rights\nAnd I think we don't recognize the historical genesis of these ideas I mean if you asked a politician you know in Europe more well why is the word dignity and your constitution they'd be\nCompletely tongue tied they have no idea why it's there but I Do think historically it has to do with democracy it has to do with this\nView that every single one of us are equal in this respect that we have agency that's what gives us the right to vote the right to speak the right to associate a and so actually this understanding of dignity is really critical to [noise]\nYeah we're their identity or feel in some cases the stump you can find your own trying suddenly go oh my God that's what I Am [noise] do you see that as inherently dangerous or do you see that as a release the recognition of diversity to be embraced\nWell it's so first of all it's universal and everybody's searching for that you know inner self sometimes it's completely individual like you're a creative artist and you don't really understand how creative you are ah so it doesn't connect you to other people but with others\nThat inner self is actually a community where you suddenly realize that you have a lot in common with another group so\nYou know everybody does that mean that that's a universal characteristics I think that modern identity politics goes off the rails\nAre only at certain critical points so\nWhen you tie identity fixed characteristic like race ethnicity or gender and begin to say everybody in this category has to think a certain way and that determines your views on politics and your views on\nYou know society in sports and they're kind of music you I mean that you know I think is not compatible with a modern democracy the other thing is it has to do with the way that we think about each other is liberty the liberty to be members of groups or\nIs it fundamentally the liberty of each one of us you know as individuals and I think the premise of our society is much more individualistic you know we we don't really recognize that you know it becomes a bigger problem\nWith certain forms of cultural recognition when the cultures themselves don't necessarily uphold liberal values or you know where that becomes a real problem but uh in this country it can also read a certain kind of intolerance or\nCan you give an example of a group that is recognized identity at a group that has found that tribalism is found in element of itself in others where they do say you have to think a certain way or you're wrong\nOr you know I think the biggest examples that are all on university campuses uh where you know it becomes very hard to um\n\n[noise]\nI'm Angie clear up this is indeed our conversation tonight is with political scientists ... with his book identity demand for dignity and the politics of resentment\nIt was a breach the touching moment in the book when someone who failed overlooked by its as flyover kind of people and he said he said there's so much focus on my not being allowed to use whatever denigrating word but it's okay to call me redneck mhm I Can't say the are worried about me and struck me as such common ground one could build on\nNo common ground I mean I think the one thing that did come out as the last two election was positive is a kind of recognition\nBut there's a lot of poor working class rural\nYou know whites that are also suffering I mean if you think about who's in the Ninety nine percent you know be an equal Ninety nine percent a lot of them are white people Seventy two thousand Americans died of you know drug overdoses in two thousand Seventeen by the last estimate a\nBecause there's this raging drug epidemic going on in those communities\nYou know I Do think that understanding how someone living in rural Kentucky\nFeels they don't have access to the media to education too you know opportunities as someone living in Palo Alto or New York or Chicago or you know I think it's important to understand that you can have that feeling of being invisible in neglected in that situation as well\nA couple of people are talking about the fact is social media on both polarization on identity politics might tackle that one\nI mean that's a no brainer [laughter]\nRight living here in Silicon valley I mean social media is almost perfectly uh adapted to promote identity politics 'cause\nUh ... actually as a colleague of mine was saying at a at a forum earlier today you know if you're a neo Nazi living in Palo Alto you don't have a lot of people to talk to write you know you know talk to a lot of your friends about how about all the the colored people are and so forth so\nOn the Internet you can do that you know you can find the thousand or there's crackpots to believe your particular conspiracy theory and you can talk to them and you can filter out everybody else that doesn't believe you are and so I Do think that\nYou know we're beginning to understand the way in which these micro identities are being shaped by the way that we communicate and these new channels of communication that have been opened up\n... you and I are both fans of Twitter and I'm curious about when you come across that sort of rhetoric on Twitter mhm do you respond to it and you let it go you know I don't know what I learned\nA long time I never read the comments when I post things or you know a articles and I do not\nI Try not to read the comments on Twitter because uh it's you know that's the other problem with Twitter and social media it's anonymous right ... and so in any kind of normal face to face social setting you feel just instinctively that you've got to be\nOh because they know who you are they can see you you know a a your neighbors can see you are on Twitter you can say anything you down one because uh you know nobody's going to know and there's not going to be any consequences for that and so\nI think that leads to a high level of civility or in some cases you might call that just honesty uh you know it's probably true that a lot of us are really not that nice you know when you scratch the surface but that's the way of civilization right I mean you know you make that stuff on Iraq\n[laughter] what about the role of the more traditional media ... what did you see them having on identity politics are perpetuating it\nUm [noise] well that's a you know that's a complicated thing I think that the traditional media has [noise]\nYou know what you say this is a function of of being a kind of gate keepers so certainly in terms of\nFactual news you know they play at a really important function that we're now beginning to regret no longer exists you know with a lot of the kind of stuff you see on the Internet but they also had been lining up as well and so you got you know Fox and uh MSNBC and you've got um you know I think\nThis is another thing that I think is not perceived by a lot of liberals the extent to which the perceived bias of the mainstream media you know has\nKind of enraged people and and you know built a following on the right for you know for the president and for people uh you know for the people like him\nBack and now they're saying that it's going to be very tough to tackle because I\nLiterally read an article about what happened to Nike's stocked after they decided to go with the county Catholic and I do read the comments and usually and there was a comment from the Trump supporters who said well that's not true\nThat whether you choose to engage in social media or comments sanctions there has to be a way to get to that person and you don't have much respect acts at the very least so there is the thing about identity politics here this person identifies as a Trump supporter\nBut if that can reverse into what nothing I hear from the media is going to be true that was pretty tough nut to crack\nA it's a it's an extremely a tough nut to crack I think that\nUh the way back you know a is first of all you've got to have more integrating kinds of institutions that build a certain degree of trust\nIn the book I say that really what you need is you know to balance these uh these very polarized identities is the focus on a an opening a liberal national identity [noise]\nYou know that Americans have to get back to fundamental agreement or on the political basis of their democracy that that's what their identity as it's not related to race or to ethnicity or it is related to the fact that we believe in the constitution and the\nDeclaration of independence you know assertion of human equality and the rule of law of these are the things that bind us as Americans are and I think actually that if you have the right kind of leadership or you could you could make that appeal because I Do think people are kind of sick of being as\nA as polarized as they are I mean there's other things I think you know in policy turns you could do but I think\nThat would be the focus is realize yeah I mean you're going to have these particular identities that's a good thing for the most part it's natural but identity as flexible and you need to have some balance because we live in a community of political community\nAnd if you don't have people that can deliberate and talk to one another and you know deal with each other in a civil way you're not going to have a very successful democracy\nWanted the arguments he frequently fee follow a very public event the department shootings say a police shooting\nYeah that's ... yeah and another person will say get over that is America until you realize that nothing is going to change you know when you're asking people to sign up to be American first you have to decide what America is near where I can agree\nI'll tell you I'll tell you what my view about that is [laughter] no because I I've got a chapter in the book on on the evolution of American identity so proud of the civil war it was it was based on race you know black people Native Americans women couldn't vote\nA citizenship really defines what national identity is and it said where excluding people on that basis so the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments after the civil war were absolutely critical and shit we in fact we just went with a bunch of my students we I I take them on a\nMidnight tours the Lincoln Memorial and ah you know we read the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural but in the Gettysburg Address you know Lincoln talks about the new birth of freedom which I think basically was the fourteenth amendment I mean this idea that\nAll all persons born or naturalized on the territory of the United states are considered citizens from now on it took a hundred years to make that a reality that's the kind of identity you know that I Believe is the only possible one for a de facto multi cultural\nMulti religious you know society um but it's also something important because those are important political principles and so it's not as if this is just a lot of fluff you know\nUh so that yeah so that's my view of what a you know it's it's sometimes called the cradle identity or that you know I think Americans need and I think with the right leadership you can lead them\nBack to is probably going to take a lot of\nOther things like maybe some big external shock you know like a war a crisis or a you know financial collapse you know to really convince people that they're in it together um [noise]\nWe're going to get the integration and just you know what I Want to go back because one of our audience members want to go back to this idea about\nPublic policy in policy ideas you want to know why why you think there's ... there's a serious thinking about public policy for policy solutions for Thirty years it'd be kind of identity politics offered she has to do and what about the proliferation of professional graduate school programs in public policy studies\n[noise] uh I don't think it's yeah so I have a lot to say about that but that's a separate evening conversation [laughter] um no I think that what happened is that a certain narrative\nTook hold in the wake of you know the great society in the Nineteen sixties that that then a concealed during the Nineteen eighties Nineteen nineties which is that ambitious social\n\n\nI'm Angie Claire oh you are listening to indeed my guess is Frank Fukuyama we're discussing his latest book identity he's just punted two conflicting polls in the immigration debate the far right in favor of a wall in strict enforcement the far left wanting no restrictions I took him up on that\nKind of different here because I've been covering immigration for your time I haven't come across people who think that it should not be enforced period I've heard a lot of people injecting pouch in for Neal who is enforced on versus who is not enforced on you know taking kids away from their parents yeah very different than saying we don't want to enforce it off\nEverybody pays lip service to enforcement but the question is you know whether you actually\nTake the measures that would be necessary to do it if you really want it to enforce immigration laws you don't build a wall\nYou basically need some form of employer sanctions and to have employer sanctions you have to have a national I. D. system and people both on the left and the writer opposed to having such an ID system\nUh and then the employers themselves don't want this you know they they don't want the burden of actually having to be the enforcement agents\nAnd quite frankly many many American employers benefit from having undocumented people working for them because they don't have to pay benefits they don't have to pay the same salaries you know so and so forth so there is a lot of practical opposition betray real enforcement policy\nAnd by the way the reason you got to go to employer sanctions is that as many as half of all the undocumented immigrants in this country are not people that\nCross the Mexican border they are visa overstays lawyers\nWho came in legally but we've just lost track of them and you know they're they're in the country without you know legal permission\nSo enforcement is actually a tough thing it'll cost a lot of money and it will be tough on people because if you're going to say you can't work here unless you actually have some citizenship or you can prove you go you're on the path to citizenship you know a lot of people are not going to like that\nThat actually takes is one of the audience questions because they refer to the international relevance to some of these issues the whole world seems to be going through similar polarization and identity crashes said talk about how this reflects some of the I\nI I could have started there really easily 'cause I run this International Center studying democracy around the world and the reason we got into this whole set of issues is that\nThere is a global populist movement that has arisen in places like turkey hungry Poland the people that voted for breakfast in Britain uh every European country now has an anti immigrant anti\nThe Sweden Democrats got Seventeen percent of the votes now the third largest party and the Swedish of parliament and so this is a global phenomenon and in fact I mean I was talking to a journalist this morning about this upcoming election in Brazil you've got this\nTo compare him to Donald Trump is really\nI mean he's like a super Trump you know a a you know he actually\nHe praises the military dictatorship you know in Brazil in the Nineteen sixties or he's willing to use you know kind of race baiting a much more explicit way than you know than our president uh and so you're seeing a lot of examples of you know\nPopulist politicians opportunistic Lee using these calls to identity to get themselves into power and the big problem with this from the standpoint of someone like me that actually likes to mock liberal democracy is that\nYou elect somebody like that they're anti institutional they say why the hell should I listen to these courts these judges or why should I tolerate all this criticism from media mainstream media all these bureaucracies that aren't doing what I Want I'm going to dismantle all of these check and balance institutions\nSo that's really you know that's the agenda the\nPresident right now in this country but that's what's been going on in Hungary where they've dismantled their independent judiciary they're doing the same thing in Poland they are basically neutralizing any kind of critical media so this was a big problem around the world [noise]\nQuestion from the audience on the topic of good and bad identity Jay Stanley differentiate good and positive propaganda speech ... speech based on whether it supports forced to merge course societal values could this criterion be applied to judging assertion identity\nYou know I think so so if you say that the fact that I'm born into a group is determinative of you know a lot of things about me you are actually challenging a pretty core\nValue because in a liberal society we regard people as individual agents who can make up their own minds about you know politics and culture in life and everything else but if you say that because you're a member of a group you really have to think a certain way I think that becomes very problematic\nYou know there there's another a more extreme example of that in Europe or where you have Muslim families\nWho send their daughters back to Iraq or Pakistan to do and then ranged marriage\nOr and then you know they've had these controversies should the state's support the family on the basis of cultural tolerance or should they support the the girl that doesn't want to you know get this um arranged marriage\nI just think there is no question in a in a liberal democracy you've got to support the girl because our core values say that you know women are individuals you know they're individuals with agency they should be able to make these decisions and\nThey're you know their families should not a override that individual decision but you know the problem with that kind of multiculturalism that understanding of multiculturalism is that people say well we have to respect the culture and the culture\nYou know subordinates women or is anti Semitic or is anti you know eh LGBT you know I mean you name it a a there are a lot of very liberal values at stake there so yes I think that's probably a good criterion\nQuestion in the audience knows dissent than I've seen an action a number of times how do we expect used without being labeled with a bad identity and one of the conflicts that I had seen their minorities or identity groups who are sick and tired of explaining their reality every damn day\nIt being representative of my community you know totally get that on the other hand there's an opportunity to educate the get lost there that's a conflict of two very valid points of view mhm huh how do you have that discussion\nLook I think that you have to have two parallel conversations right so you need to build understanding of the specific\nOf forms of marginalization of all of these different groups and they really are different from one another uh but you know you also\nNeed to shift from you know lived experience to just plain experience right uh so lived experience is you know subjective experience that\nReally only I have access to but you also have have community if you can somehow transcend lived experience to just plain old experience which you know can be shared with people where you can have communal memories that are actually broader than simply a small group so I just think you gotta have both conversations\nAbout populism says someone from the audience I really needs to be a bright spot in Europe Seventeen percent of the population foreign born with no discernible populist movement can you comment on that\nYeah there's other countries you can point to so you know the United states has about Fifteen Percent foreign born right now Canada's got like twenty two twenty three a Australia's got a higher rate of foreign born in the United states none of these countries have serious populist movements\nIreland's a complicated case because it's a lot of that has to do with its relation to written in Northern Ireland but\nIn the case of Canada and Australia\nThe difference the big difference in their immigration policies versus a skill based policy\nOr so a lot of the people that come in these foreigners come in are wealthy skilled their doctors you know they find ready places you know within the economy but the second thing is that they really don't permit a illegal immigration\nKnow Australians deal with this by taking all these refugees and sticking them in and now we were popular in New guinea which is not a very nice thing to do\nBut the one thing that that has produced is there's no backlash because people think that the government is still in control and\nWe're only going to take as many immigrants as we think are good for our society and I think that's important so you can have a higher number of immigrants if you feel that you know somehow it's a it's a managed form of immigration\nBecause you happen to read a biking economics by George lake you know I didn't hear it meant admiration for the Nordic system is that you can\nIntegrate but you must work mhm and you don't necessarily get to live in the town you want to leave and if we find you a job and it's over on the other side of the country you will take that job and you take it for a year now and wants you to stab yourself you can do something else happening\nWell you know frankly I think that if you want to properly assimilate immigrants you can't just have a less safe fair you know liberal policy where everybody does whatever they down please the government actually has to take a positive role and the most important role is in the in the education system", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "city": "San Francisco",
