this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic in deep we do like to disclose our bias are biased is that fracking is irresponsible and proven to be an environmental detriment\nThat is however a very easy thing to say from the comfort of Silicon Valley there are people who live where fracking is life fracking is a livelihood\nAnd unfortunately we hear again and again that it's rock and a hard place they can stay in poverty or they can have a chance to get some money\nAnd then end up with the kind of consequences we find out about ... amity and prosperity book written by lunch Griswold who spent seven years is that right was one family and their friends documenting exactly what happened with fracking amity and prosperity\nNot just the spirit of the books but the names of the city's involved Eliza Griswold is the author of the very much claimed tenth parallel she's also a poet and I'm really glad to have her here in the\nWelcome thank you [laughter]\nSo ... so happens that there is another political move this time in Connecticut I Believe that's going to be dealing with fracking when people here that fracking may become to their community let's talk about\nWhat that means there is gas in the ... in the rock that can be released how is that done and why does pollute I'm going to give you\nKind of a cartoon version because\nThat will make some sense of how the way it works is that is traditionally we think oil and gas we think it's somewhere near the surface then\nProcess is about drilling down up to two miles down into the earth that the vertical it's cold and then you can drill out what are called lateral are horizontal drills that go out as much as four miles away and the idea is that if you you said\nMillions upon millions of gallons of water chemicals and sand down into the earth and out sideways and what that\nLiquid does is it ... the rocket fractures ancient shale basically ancient ocean bed and the critters that carbon rich bodies of critters that lived inside that\nSo the the rock fractures the bubbles of oil and gas are that are trapped inside that rock are relieved at that all of that comes back up to the surface everything sucked back up the oil and gas and all of that waste\nWhich comes with it ... it carries not only the hazardous chemicals that are used in the fracking process it also carries\nA lot of radioactivity because radioactivity is naturally occurring and one of the things that industry often does is try to evade responsibility sidestep it by talking about arsenic arsenic is naturally occurring so okay it's naturally occurring but it doesn't have to come out of the earth\nSo radioactivity as ... as one of these naturally occurring elements that is actually\nObviously can be hazardous to what the health so it all comes back up and then the question is what are you going to do is a waste\nNow in many places what you can do with the ways in Ohio for instance and Ohio is has many of these deep injection wealth Pennsylvania has a couple too but they're harder to drill in Pennsylvania\nWhere you just inject that waist deep into the earth well this is what causes are earthquakes\nFracking itself is documented cause earthquakes but injection wealth as well so how are we going to get rid of this ways how does it cause harm\nYes and that's one reason this took so long because I was very careful about what I could document and what I could understand I'm going to tell you about what went wrong in this case and how there are\nPotential hazards along the way that don't necessarily say fracking will always go wrong\nBut this is where it can do wrong okay the industry itself will say the probably the greatest source of contamination is what happens at the surface because\nAt this site alone there were dozens if not hundreds of spills have talked sick material and diesel fuel and you know at one point to try to kill that bacteria the industry used um eight hundred pounds of a bio side that is\nDocumented to be carcinogenic so if they were here are saying well that's not fracking no it's not getting its which had to do to mitigate what happened from the fracking OK so there are tons and tons of problems but when you pump the the elements into the earth is\nOften well casings that cement that his case that cases the pipe going down into the ground well casings fail so and it's not always clear to know what when and where they have failed which was documented in this case\nHow they compare to coal mining in terms of you know the devil you know versus the devil you don't how much damage had cold on by the time fracking came in that\nSuch a great question and I think that that is really the question that I as an outsider another report are coming in to cover the fracking boom really needed to ask because if you sit down and you talk with old timers who live in ... and surrounding towns\nThey will explain to you that the industry as a given cake\nThey've been living next to and on top of coal mining for more than a century they've they've gotten jobs really in exchange for their health\nAnd things we wouldn't think about roads giant coal waste ponds so I had the pleasure last year of going to report on the most incredible young woman whose name is Veronica top death I wrote about her and the New Yorker and\nVeronica nickname is running because her mother gave all of her daughters gender neutral nickname so that they could survive in a man's world so Ronnie grew up in a part of an a neighboring county where the mine came through she was learning to drive when they came through and she she was Fifteen\nAnd they shut down the road that she was learning to drive on because of course they own\nThey own about thirty percent of the county it's not just what we think of like oh coal mining and you know ... and and these waste products in the air and in the water is literally the takeover of the entire\nCounty and and there's so many knock on effects from if a if a company or a series of companies owns thirty percent of your county where you can't find housing you know you think about cutting the tax base who's paying for the rose to be repaired all of these effects of what I Would call public poverty\nHow do you how do we look in a more sophisticated way at\nThe privatization of profit and the socialization of cost so companies that are extracted companies pass on environmental costs social costs infrastructure cost cost to education because people are going to drop out of high school if you can make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a coal miner\nTo high school what forget it and that's happening now with the natural gas industry as well let's\nAbout your protagonist she is a mother a woman who at no point has been ... anywhere in a region that is not prosperous in an ideal world what could the fracking money have meant to them if it weren't for\nSo stay he grew up um as the daughter of an out of work steel worker Anna Vietnam combat vet and at that person as being they inherit or of that identity really made her think how am I going to be helpful to my region and my family and getting out of poverty\nSo her hope was that she would or nine thousand dollars which is the price of a dream barn because she had aid acres and she was hoping to lease each of them for a thousand dollars each and that was going to basically secure her place in the middle class\nExpectations weren't really terribly army yeah putting a refund a barn putting a barn up she grew up in a family were water balloons run extravagance because water as an extra against so one of the roots of not just her family but that area what were the economic\nSo first of all I Love no one has talked me about the water balloons yet to me it was a shocking discovery when I you know of all the things that this family grew up without to think that water balloons were luxury just really helped me recess that what we all the ... that we all carry yeah\nUm so the economic roots of this area are very interesting you know we are all growing accustomed to this rural urban divide here division is born out of before actually the revolutionary war\nThe people who've who've gathered in this area who really settled this area a war European settlers\nOf course they displaced indigenous people Native Americans who are there and that place meant was pretty bloody and pretty intense and\nHow it worked was a European settlers would come to the colonies and the quake early in Philadelphia sent them west relate to unsettled plan where they fought these Native American wars so there was a lot of resentment among settlers among the American frontier about\nThe the urban elite all the way back this time because of course settlers weren't allowed to own land this was Native American land and in fact there was a law in place that said that the settlers had to get off his Native American land or the settlers themselves could be killed so\nThat is the root of some of the tensions that we're seeing today so people were small farmers but they were really eking out a living on very stubborn or is this was never a land very I mean it was absolutely\n\n[noise] well come back if indeed my guest is Eliza Griswold we're talking about her story of family in crisis because of the fracking industry\nAmity and prosperity one family and the fracturing of America so when did Stacey first start noting that things were going south with her family are houses they start noticing um things are going south before I met her she and her\nNeighbor best boils in the fall late summer of two thousand ten ... every year they go to the Washington County fair and the Washington County fair is really a pattern in our lives about it because they have these small farms and they show animals and\nFor a ... big big part of state is life with our kids\nSo she neighbor bass met up at the farm and that's told Stacey that their poppy had died um and that was enough they were both families they treat their animals like children really I mean\nThat there's always feeding our animals angel hair pasta zucchini and meatball subs and you know at so\nSee they are like people in their family so Stacey new comments this puppy very well in fact Carl Lee was already sick and one of the things that distracted Harley cause they'd miss most of his seventh grade year at home sitting at home was playing with this puppy the best daughter would bring the puppy you know they live next door so it just bring the puppy down\nTo play with ... with hunters with hunter who is hardly a puppy\nSo wed Stacey learned that this puppy had died she hadn't bass it wasn't long after that that they started to think okay we've lost this puppy we've lost a horse Harley is mysteriously ill and it was on the phone when Stacy was with Beth a couple of months after the fair\nThat a light bulb went off for ... for Stacy thinking my God\nCould whatever is sickening our animals be sickening Harley also and she called her\nUm she called the pediatrician that moment as because he'd seen hardly many times they couldn't figure it out\nAnd he said bring heartland right away and we'll have hurt him tested for arsenic exposure because that was one of the things that was sickening these animals and so that was the fall late fall two thousand ten and I met Stacey a couple of months after where she was she had\nGone from having Harley tested for arsenic poisoning to starting to understand what might be in her\nAnd her daughter and her family's bodies as a result of of exposure to oil and gas and because she was a nurse at the nearby hospital she could work up these tests with the head of the lab so she had had her\nSelf and our children tested for benzene and tell you in exposure and discovered that they that these gas related materials were in their bodies and she decided to speak out publicly for the first time at a local gathering\nAnd I ... it actually in West Virginia just about an hour from her house in a place called Morgantown Morgantown airport\nThey'd taken over the airport for the day these ... these people who are concerned about fracking and I happened to be their dad that day and I was sitting a couple of rows behind Stacy and her daughter\nWearing her pajamas that morning and she was grouchy I just didn't know who they were but I heard them talking and a\nPage was hungry states they didn't have anything for she said you should have eaten before we left the house and I reached into my backpack and pulled out some Ernest\nBar that I usually have with me while I'm working and a page very wisely you know the same voice that I don't want that gross bar [laughter] couple of minutes later Stacey got up and she started to talk and she said my name is Stacy hanni I'm a single mom\nOf two kids I'm a nurse at the local hospital and we have fencing and tell you in in us and we think it's from exposure to\nAbout a quarter of a mile from our house we have discovered a massive industrial site that's just gone in behind a high fence we discovered it because my daughter went on Google Earth in her seventh grade computer class and she her assignment was to find our land find our house and she found this massive waste beyond\nA that's just a quarter of a mile from us and so that was such a state she knew when I met her it was really the beginning of this mystery and\nI was with her over the seven years she and her neighbor began to piece together with the help of different experts they found\nOut what was going on and it turned out that this massive pond that was as large as her entire farm was leaking and it was not only leaking into the ground but it was off gassing massive amounts of of a of a gas called hydrogen sulfide\nAt lives really bacterial infection in the pond and and that also was leading to health problems they believe ...\nYou mentioned at the end of your books you were working overseas on stories when you suddenly when you realize the connection between\nThe reliability of infrastructure and care from the government in the face of this kind of thing and you saw the same thing happening now in America can you draw that connection absolutely you know\nThis to me I think if there's one take away from me from writing this this is really so I had spent most of my career as a journalist so probably Fifteen Years as a conflict correspondent working a war zones in Africa and Asia Afghanistan or Iraq\nI'm Somalia a and other places like Nigeria and I was in Nigeria I was in northern Nigeria a in a very fraught place when\nUh the bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in twenty Thirteen and Thirteen people were killed\nAnd Britain collapse in Nigeria also and I had to get a cross was covering a little local\nWar and I had to ... I had to cross a river where there was no bridge anymore and I did what you do as a journalist so I was riding on his empty oil barrel across the river and I was thinking about Minneapolis and I was thinking you know\nThis is the social ills sees how the our sense of collective poverty right the collapse of bridges of what we call lifeline systems\nBridges roads are reservoirs the Internet the grid these things are happening in America and what I learned is you know there's something that we have for liberal ... economists have cast abroad\nSince the nineties this idea of something we call the resource cursor sometimes the paradox of plenty which is how is it that people who are often live on land the richest in natural resources are among the poorest on the earth\nRight and we usually look at that in Africa and Asia we call it um the global south like we're we're we're to these problems happened the truth is they happened in America too and nowhere more so than Appalachia and that's really what I learned\nWas talking about when she started to engage with\nSome are both local and federal ... we're supposed to be protecting her let's start first with her interacting with Corp itself\nSo stay the as soon that very day which happened to be her birthday when she invest spoke on the phone a and she thought oh my gosh what if Harley as being sickened by what's happening next door um [noise]\nI think just to correct myself I think that that was a couple of the results of the testing came back on her birthday so\nWhen Stacy found out that it could be arsenic that was sickening her child um she called the company immediately she called them before she had test results and she said I'm afraid that your operation next door is sickening us and they responded\nWith sending immediately within twenty four hours they send something called the water buffalo over to stasis house now water buffalo is something she knows a lot about because growing up without drinking water which we can talk about some point\nThey often relied on these massive jobs of water and that's when the coal mine comes through and you don't have water anymore you often feed your cattle from a water buffalo\nSo the company started supplying her water and then she got the results back from Harley's testing and told them what had happened that and [noise]\nIt ... she dead hand delivered the results of Harley's testing to the company which is not far away it's about a half an hour drive from her home to their corporate headquarters in South western Pennsylvania\nAnd she heard nothing she heard nothing time and again finally she was she got a call and so did bass her neighbor to come in and meet with a company and that they had their results not only from\nFrom blood testing and they had the results from blood and urine of not only medical tests but they had conducted what they called independent water tests they had hired companies to come out and do what are testing and there were certain things that Stacy and that's where a particularly concerned about because they had learned enough about what\nHad been trouble for other people with oil and gas\n... glycol uh anti freeze and other elements that they thought they were concerned about and when they went in to meet with a company for the first time the company told them that\nUh there there was nothing to be concerned about with their water that they had the results of these tests and in fact the tests prove that there was nothing wrong with our water\nAnd they handed these test results over um they handed the results over and Stacey saw that glide calls were missing and she asked about whether or not they were had been tested for and the company to mirrored\nIt said do we have a little more time with the logic Griswold going into steroid amity and prosperity one family and the fracturing of America\nWas traced some of the legal actions which took seven years to resolve it Stacy and eventually the some others came in her girlfriend bass and her family became part of it and it became this wrestling between\nKnow would they be able to go to court would Kendra lawyer be able to get through with millions of documents to be able to raise your kids at the same time\nBut eventually it did go before the mediators and that took forever so can you give us a little path of how legal action west sure I mean for me one of the challenges was just keeping track of this just mug shrink mushrooming number of lawsuits that came out of what happened right so we\nWith a sick kid and you know a a dead goat a dead puppy a couple of dying courses and we lead into the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania right so\nOne case there is a plaintiff case there's the case that Stacy and her neighbors brought against the company\nAnd that took years of documentation and fighting and you know what ... Smith the lawyer discovered as she started to drill down into these documents is that there was just a pattern\nOf obfuscation like I told you a little bit before about the difference between what the raw data water test would read and then the results that were given to Stacy in ... there were no major discrepancies in those\nUm and larger patterns of things that didn't show up right didn't didn't square right and a normal plaintiff attorney would have had to give up but because Cantor had this corporate she was from the other side she had this expensive training\nThat allowed her to keep going\nOn so that was the plane of suit that just unfolded at a grinding rate year after year judge after judge because that's another form of public poverty on the judiciary system here one judge would have it for a couple of years and he would retire than they were so swamped with cases another judge would have to come back\nTwo days a week thing just eked along\nThe same time the Smiths take on and this was truly her relax at no gain to themselves at only cost\nThey take on state um they take on the commonwealth of Pennsylvania because the commonwealth is trying to pass this new oil and gas law called act Thirteen\nThat is basically going to give drillers like range resources the drill the right to drill wherever they want in unity and communities won't have local say sell anymore at all\nThe case a book all that goes all the way up to the state Supreme Court and they know that they're facing a conservative Republican bench right they're going to have to make this case that drilling is dangerous to the conservative Republicans who have a history of supportive industry\nAnd they make the case of Pennsylvania and have the right to clean air and pure water which is actually a law and the books in Pennsylvania\nAnd that law and Stacey testimony which go all the way up to the state Supreme Court\nMake the state Supreme Court find in their favor and that is one of the most hopeful messages and something that that's not that people can really take away from this book the plaintiff case is more frustrating and\nIt settles at the end of the book and as part of the settlement which is confidential\nI don't know the terms I Can't know the terms they're sealed but I can report on how Stacey ... feel about the terms because I can ask them about that and what I can tell you is that they are disappointed deeply disappointed and I would guess I Would say reading the book carefully is is it is a good way to understand\nReally what happened to them and how this case unfolded has changed the mind that anyone who thought she was in it for money or ... or whatever [noise]\nI don't know I don't know um\nKnow I think the public perception and amity was everything was going to lead to big payday I mean even you know the ... the the lack of experience with journalism and book writing too I think that they thought that Stacy was going to make some kind of money from my writing this book\nAnd the opposite is true I mean essentially what Stacy did is just\nSit down for hours upon hours with me after working Eighteen hour days double shifts at the hospital and she would update me on what was going on and\nShe really sees herself and her family as needing to be an example of what not to do of how you can fight back and she felt that she was serving the public good by talking to me and what I did at the end you know the book is incredibly intimate there's a lot of sickness in there\nI'm Out along with a lot of stomach illness a lot of sick kids and the gross mis that goes along with that and by the end of the book we know how many barrage she has you know and\nThat it's that intimate this is immersion journalism this is really living alongside people for a long long time and when I finished it even though along the way I had described just to see what I was doing and Harley in particular\nI wasn't sure they really understood who could know what somebody else was seeing so I drove down to amity 'em and Stacey took a couple of days off of work at our own expense\nAnd I read them the entire book at the kitchen table because I felt like I didn't have the right to write about what had happened to them if I couldn't sit and face Sam I'm and read how intimately what I had seen and that was difficult\nIt was so difficult for safety to hear it there was no kind of glory and having a book written about her it was excruciating and for Harley too\nUh but they went through it at one point she felt there was something she was doing it was patriotic enough\nWhen she signed this lease for oil and death she was told by the company representative there called ... and the people who come out and and they're real estate agents there signing up your mineral lease as\nShe was told about American energy independence which is you know old as the hills this idea that we will be energy independent and we could have a whole discussion about how flawed that notion as um so what happened is she thought that by the energy independent she would help bring industry back to Appalachia\nSo job she had watched the steel mills close she'd watched her father\nJobs back here and it's also going to ... keep soldiers like my dad out of foreign entanglements over oil right we are going to strengthen our national security bite relying on ourselves by for energy and she thought both of those aspects patriotic\n[noise] we talked earlier about how the idea that recycling fracking water is a bit of a false would perhaps an entire fall for the house the water's theoretically recycled and where does that\nGo wrong so I'm not going to get into the technicalities because I don't feel to be honest well versed enough and how that really works and the idea though is that all of that flow back everything that comes out of the earth\nCan be stored it can be re used in more fracking and essentially they took a while to get to this point uh but some scientists at some of the ... they're both corporations local companies and this is actually in Pennsylvania one of the pieces because this is a complicated story\nI Would be doing a disservice to the Pennsylvania is to say that\nFracking had only brought loss to the region for landowners and some small business owners like those involved and recycling waste water it has been a big boon right um so the idea is\nCan all of that wastewater be used again and fracking now the problems have to do with where are you going to store it you're going to store it and one of these ... that's one of you can store it in what's called a closed loop systems in in a field tanks\nAs to the date of my reporting that was not happening these ponds we're still in use 'em and you need to think about how what happens with a concentration of these elements overtime in that water as they grow more as their reuse what is that\nWhat is that toxic slug sludge about so one of the things that's happening now in fracking which has to do with this technological innovation is that as I was saying a lot are all you can drill out as much as four miles we got to think if you're scaling up to that level and you're having multiple wells on these well pads\nWhat kind of waste you generate an arrow gender you got Kenneth many well he's got a ... a lateral that it's four times as long you need to use ... naturally more fluid more chemicals more sand\nTo reach to basically get the get the gas and the oil out of the earth and that in itself is something that people haven't looked at too much but that in itself is a problem that I don't think recycling waste water is going to solve\nI Want to correct something I said earlier it's not Connecticut that is looking at its prop one twelve at Colorado oh yeah getting right always do you know something about that\nI just a little bit about it again I like to really report to speak more about what I've reported on closely over time since I haven't\nUm but what I think Colorado is facing exactly some of these measures\nThat Pennsylvania they're facing exactly what Pennsylvania has right and the hope is so Pennsylvania has extremely strong local governments and those local governments have made it so that at a local level some communities can pass very basic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "24"}
