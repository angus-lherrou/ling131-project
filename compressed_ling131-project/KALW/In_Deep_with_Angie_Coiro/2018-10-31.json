San Francisco from the dragon theater in Redwood City California I'm Angie Cairo and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic\nThis hour we'll be part history lesson part rally of hope my ... D D gotten plant is incredible observer of America's political Meyer\nAs award winning journalist author and editor at large at the nascent his latest book weaves together American political history\nAnd profiles of today's Americans who are working to make history well to bend the arc of history toward justice\nThe book is called an extra public the rise of the new radical majority and he's here with us at the dragon welcome thanks so much great to be here about the evolution of words first because the word populism has become almost a dirty dirty word yeah what what's going\nOn and I and I'm trying to rescue it that's one of the things that this book is trying to do is trying to\nPoint partly because I live part of the year in Europe where it is almost only a dirty word at least in America it's still contested I'm so in Europe it's all about Donald Trump Viktor Orban you know the prime minister of Austria the leader of Italy or none of whom were ... people you would want to associate with politically\nAnd I think the reason for that is because Europeans don't know anything about American history they don't think we have any history so they don't bother to learn the populism is an American invention we invented it in the Eighteen eighties originally in Texas clever and Texas and then in Omaha Nebraska\nAnd when you say we invented what what would you define it I'm\nSure well it was it was an agrarian revolt it was a a revolt by mostly southern and Midwestern farmers\nAre against the system that was called the debt lean systems so the way that worked as you would have land and you'd be a farmer but you wouldn't have any money\nSo you couldn't buy seed or fertilizer or the things you needed to plant crops so instead you would go into debt to do that and the the furnishing man as he was called was the person who would lend you those things in exchange for a lean so first call on whatever crop you got\nIt was almost like Cher cropping except that it wasn't share cropping\nBecause your debts get larger and larger and larger as anybody who's for example a college student in the United states [laughter] I can relate to\nYou know your desk just piling up and getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so this was also at the same time that the railroads were imposing you know heavy fees on farmers who wanted to ship their grain to market John de Rockefeller was making sure that the railroads he owned\nGave preferential treatment to him and punish people who are not part of standard oil or part of his combine so people rose up together\nAnd it was what was interesting about first of all the the great history of populism is called the populist moment it's by Lawrence good when\nI recommend that anybody who hasn't read it should read it right after they read my book but it's fantastic and he he calls populism a cultural achievements of the first magnitude\nAnd that's because he understood something that the left has forgotten but that Breitbart understood and sad and Steve Bannon quotes a lot which is the politics is downstream of culture and what that means is that if you want to change the world and you want to make political change\nYou sometimes have to change the culture first so the culture that the populists were were revolting against we're trying to change the culture that said that farmers were ignorant people they didn't know anything\nAnd if they had no business arguing with the furnishing merchants or the bankers are the people who wanted to run their lives and sees their land and take their houses\nAnd so they came together and part of what they did when they\nWhere they would essentially bringing lecturers who would explain things like how economics works how loans work\nYou know what the history of land tenure issues in the U.S so that they had intellectual equipment\nTo base their revolt on a and they found it a political party called the people's party which a sense where the word populism comes from and the people's party Rand candidates\nBut they also did things like they issue these demands so the the first populist platform was the clever and demands and Texas the more elaborate one was the Omaha demands in Nebraska and the interesting thing is if you look at the Omaha demands they are demands for things like an eight hour day\nFor a old age pension is for\nEqual rights for men and women this isn't an era when women didn't have the vote ... uh and\nThey were dismissed as pie in the sky things that could never happen\nThey became part of the socialist party platform or by the Nineteen tens the same set of demands and the interesting thing is that then the progressive party which was the sort of\nLeft wing of the Republican Party or in the early twentieth century past a lot of them into law under the under Teddy Roosevelt presidency so you know these things that were impossible in Eighteen eighty were law by Nineteen twenty and\nI guess the thing about the populist for me is that\nThey represented a revolt of most people the majority of people against an elite the told them they had no right to a decent law right and they were a political uprising they were also an effort and early effort to build a multi racial movement because the populists\nIn the south or mostly white farmers but there was something called the colored farmers alliance\nAnd they would they would wage campaigns together against banks and against furnishing merchants and they also came up with their own vision for a cooperative economy where people would be able to borrow\nFrom the government based on banks were based on their the crops instead of borrowing from private bankers and from private capital\nThey want to basically land bags which is in fact they have these things in Germany and European countries where if you're a farmer you can ... you can borrow based on your land at very low rates and they had these ... they they wanted the ... the farmers to foreign cooperative to market there\nYou go to market their products cooperatively so they could get a better price than just one form or trying to sell stuff so a lot of things they did\nCame to pass but the political wing of the populist party that sort of running people for office that didn't work out so well I mean they they got millions of votes in Eighteen Ninety two and then in Eighteen Ninety six or the populist party and the Democratic party both nominated William Jennings Bryan for president\nAnd instead of running on the sort of broad populist platform he essentially ran on a kind of [noise]\nRepeal the gold standard and uh make silver legal tender platform which was much more narrow it was much more conservative in a way than the full populist platform and not only that but the he had I forget who his vice presidential candidate was on the Democratic line\nHis vice presidential candidate on the populous line because he was running on two two two party lines which you could which you could do then was a a Georgia newspaper man called Tom Watson Tom watching wasn't incredibly gifted campaigner an organizer who had done a lot\nSort of to unite white and black poor farmers in Georgia\nBut he was selling deterred by the the way in which he felt Brian sold out\nAnd and the way in which he felt that they were betrayed by the Democratic party\nThat he became an incredibly toxic racist instead of ... campaigning for sort of you know in an alliance of black and white and ...\nA white supremacy and on anti Semitism ... it was Tom watching the sort of after the the demise of the populist party\nThat was the main propagandist for lynching Leo Frank the Jewish businessmen who was who was the only white man lynched in the state of Georgia so populism has a mixed heritage mhm and the thing is you have to be honest about the mixed heritage but what people nowadays tend to do is they tend to only focus on the sort of\nYou know the disaster afterwards rather than the promise of the movement right\nIf we want to deconstruct what happened back then one of the things I'm most curious about is how some of the very same things they were fighting for than we're still fighting for now what kind of messaging was being used in opposition to the populist party that might be reflected in the opposition today\nWell I mean one of the message is used in opposition was that if if white and black farmers got together then that would end white supremacy and you would lose\nYou would lose your social position you'd be no better than a black man ... uh you know another another message that was used against them was it was impossible that would lead to economic ruin a the country would go broke because one of the things\nThe populists new which mainstream ... economics has forgotten or is that the federal budget is not like a household budget you know household budget you have an economy of expenses and as Dickens said I think it was ... he said if your\nIf your expenses or a penny less than your income that's happiness and fair pay more than your income that despair\nBut countries aren't like that country's control their own currency\nAnd you know uh the populist understood that and they understood it not because they were genius economists but because of the civil war because they'd seen during the civil war that in order to pay for the civil war Lincoln had printed money he'd printed greenbacks which were the first notes that were not backed by gold\nAnd they were ... and that's why they're called green backs to distinguish them from gold bills that were backed by gold held in Fort Knox or another federal treasuries\nAnd he'd done not to pay the union soldiers and to pay for the the goods they needed for the union army and it had resulted in a an enormous explosion of growth in fact in the American economy\nWell I come back and indeed my guest is Dee Dee getting planned the book under discussion the next Republican the rise of radical new majority and I loved this decision I Love this image of you discovering bits of essentially an old society\nWell when I Would when I was traveling around Ohio I Would come across these things like the bowl federal building in Canton or the rubber dome in Akron which were obviously\nBeautifully built structures and the boat federal buildings this incredible curve front on the streets it's got all these murals inside a documenting Ohio history\nAnd finally I came across one that had a cornerstone and of course John said project I dunno eleven thirty two\nPi Wu a and that's what I realized ... W H stands for public works administration I realize that was\nThe W. P. A. the new deal was this last civilization part of that was yes there was a time when government understood that expanding the comments the the thing that we all owned together the public sphere\nWas both good economics and good social policy because it created\nThese wonderful things that we still have that we still benefit from if you go to the Cleveland public library you see these wonderful WPN murals of bridging the Ohio River you know if you go to post offices all across the country if they have murals and then they were probably painted by somebody on the on the artist project I'm\nSo there was the role of the ... there were government understanding its role and its potential\nAnd at the same time because Roosevelt had to fight World War two he had to pay for this incredible ... mobilization and produce production of you know plain ship's tanks all all the things you need to fight a war like Lincoln he had to make incredible changes to the economy\nSo that they they raise the top rate on taxes to Ninety five percent they started in the state tax so that wealth as well as income could be taxed and of course they ran up an incredible federal deficit\nAnd the result of all this was something that economic historians called the great compression so if you look at income distribution in the U.S from Nineteen thirty nine to Nineteen Seventy\nInstead of looking as does now like a huge pyramid with a few millionaires and billionaires is Bernie says at the top and you know the rest of the Ninety nine percent at the bottom what ... what it looked like during those years was like a a diamond did it been squashed any chance so it ... out in the middle of the big middle\nAnd a small upper class at a small lower class and that was the great American middle class and that came about\nBecause you had this jobs program you had people who went and served in the war and then came back and we're able like members of my family to go to college on the GI Bill ... again which was free public college or in fact free college anywhere\nFor people who had served in the armed forces well that was a huge cohort of people and then you have programs like federal housing guarantees you a federal home administration you have this vast this vast middle class that was created during those years and it lasted it's long tale lasted up until really the Nineteen eighties\nThere were people who were vehemently opposed and I ...\nIt's time I have to wonder about what we're seeing now where is the pyramid where there are so many at the top and\nSo little money at the bottom how much of that can be recreated at this point\nWell you know Roosevelt always faced opposition he he made his great speech in Nineteen thirty six about economic Roy ... smell of factors have great wealth\nOr he understood that you can't have a more equal society without somebody paying for it and he was quite clear about who was going to pay for it and he was quite clear he said I rejoice than my enemies I mean he knew who his enemies were and instead of deciding that he was going to temper eyes and you know try and compromise with them\nWhich is what the Democratic Party has been doing for the last Twenty years\nHe's he stuck to his guns but it's also true that Roosevelt coalition his political coalition\nWas built in part on an alliance with southern Democrats who are committed to maintaining white supremacy ... uh and so at the end of World War two when you had all of these social programs in this great mobilization and again\nPolitics as downstream of culture so you had a big cultural changes in the Nineteen thirties you know you had African Americans Mexican Americans becoming much more assertive about their rights beginning to organize farm workers union so you know the cannery strikes and all all these things happening on the west coast but lots of things happening in the east coast and in the south\nAnd the southern Democrats were terrified\nThey were terrified that this newly empowered African American cohort who had fought in the war you know and then Harry Truman desegregated the armed forces a Philip Randolph had forced Roosevelt by threatening to march on Washington\nTo Institute a federal equal opportunities program so that all federal employment there was no discrimination on the basis of race um so they were threatened by that and they split off and they\nYou know they read baited they destroyed the most progressive unions through the Taft Hartley law on through making union leaders you know sign anti communist dose which many of the most progressive leaders couldn't do because they in fact we're communists uh so yeah capital fought back and you know eventually they weren't\nQuestions from the audience when you talk about public culture what do you think is the culture of Trump's base versus Bernie followers\nWell that's that's a really good question [laughter] I guess I think the ... the culture of uh of both we have a common culture in this country and I think it doesn't do anybody any favors to pretend that our culture on the left is somehow\nBetter more dignified more wonderful and the their culture is his crew we all watched TV we all laugh at many of the same jokes we all go to many of the same movies I Would say that um\nThat one of the cultural differences between us is that our culture seems more comfortable with difference and their cultures seems to be more about reinforcing sameness and keeping everybody it's almost like um you know the little kids who are terrified that the peas my touched the potatoes [laughter]\nDo you know I think I think that's a cultural difference I've observed I'm\nWashing the science of politics and the science of language both support that I'm Talking about George lake off the model of the conservatives want the firm's father figure were held them what is and then you have\nThe more liberal people look for more nurturing mother figure and and have more empathy and then you have all the science that Chris Mooney has put together that essentially underlines the same thing from a scientific point of view what parts of the brain light up when you're getting different messages\nYeah or you know ... or you I mean I thought that you know there's some data that says the the best predictor of who's going to vote either right\nAnd you know that may be so I don't know what I what I Do know is that\nIn a way I'm less interested in the differences I mean I think the differences matter and it's important to know who you're talking to\nBut I'm more interested in people who say the same thing to everybody\nIn a way that was one of the things that intrigued me about Bernie is that he said the same thing to everybody I went to see him speak or in Lynchburg, Virginia at you know ... Liberty University\nSo this was not a friendly audience you know if ten thousand people there might have been ten sympathizers ... [laughter]\nUm but he said the same thing to them he said look we differ on you know questions of religion and faith than we are and we differ I'm about lots of things but we all think that families are important and that people should be able to look after their kids and look after their parents\nWithout a fear of financial ruin so you know he made a pitch for common ground which I thought was interesting on the other hand or maybe on the same hand\nTrump made a speech in ... in Pennsylvania so hollowed out former steel town in western Pennsylvania where no politicians had come since John F. Kennedy went there in Nineteen sixty two\nUh and he talked about reviving American manufacturing and uh about the need for domestic production\nAnd his his speech was described in newspapers as a as a repudiation of a half century of Republican orthodoxy in terms of economic thinking because he he talked about the importance of manufacturing and the importance of what it meant to be a country that made things\nAnd you know I think first of all I didn't think he wrote his own speech and secondly I don't think he meant very much of it\nBut the fact that he said it and he said it to people who were desperate to hear it ... I thought was interesting because they weren't hearing anything like that from Hillary Clinton that what they were hearing for Hillary Clinton is we're going to put a lot of coal miners out of work and if you're lucky we'll give you some retraining\nAnd you know anybody who's ever been promised retraining\nKnows that the only people who get jobs when retraining is on the agenda or the people who are doing the ... ... so I think a whole lot of what happened in twenty sixteen was you had you had people who are desperate for change who were in pay and who were suffering and who knew that America was not great\nSo that when Hillary Clinton said America's already great they knew not to believe for cars their own lives were refutation of it every day\nBut the door to the left towards change was barred\nSo the only door that they felt was open to them was to take the other door to door to the right now the door to the right I think was delusional and you know hopefully people will be waking up to that but but if you were desperate for change you know it was hard to argue that you should argue that you should vote for four more years\nVery blue in the game\nAnd it's a little more time with Dee Dee gotten planned the next Republican the rise of radical majority this is Andy I'm Angie ... and let's talk a little bit more about union organizing to me that it's so key not just for the immediate you know here's a group of people who will benefit as a whole but this\nWhole philosophy that we can be empowered from below in from within\nWell I think so there are two things I mean Jane Mac levy who is this union organizer who's a subject my first chapter says that if we give up\nOn organizing together we give up the only weapon that ordinary people really have which is greater numbers you know if you look at the slogan of the later labor party under Germany corporate in Britain it's for the many not the few that's not he didn't come up with that Percy ... Shelley came up with that um [noise]\nBut that's essential to any majority are in politics that you have to be you have to mobilize an organized and show that you have the power of large numbers because they have the power of capital um\nBut there's another part of it as well which is what is the primary virtue of the union movement\nWhat what are we seeing a union routes we sing solidarity forever\nOr in the sense part of what my book is about is an exploration of the various kinds of solidarity not just within the union movement but\nWithin an across racial lines a solidarity with people who who have to dwell on the earth together and who have to you know be supportive of each other in our relationship to the land in a sense\nI guess I Would argue that solidarity is less cardinal virtue in the same way that may be the right thing self reliance on their car do for a tree you know we don't didn't need any help from anybody um whereas we have to help each other uh so I think that's another reason why I put a union organizer first but\nI also want to see them a against that I mean not against putting earring organizer first but you know if you are involved in left politics you will have heard from people who generally tend to look like me which is to say old white guys that um [noise]\nIf only women would stop talking about gender if only people have power would stop talking about racism that we could put together this class based struggle which would bring us to the cooperative commonwealth and I you know the identity politics has this terrible diversion\nAnd part of my motivation writing the book and in the way it's structured just to show that that is I'm not allowed to say the word I really want to use for baloney [laughter] that you know in a sense that's what destroyed the Roosevelt republic was the fact that it pretend at all\nThanks and therefore they were raised made it out of existence a and that the Democratic party pretended that they didn't have to to care that half of their you know the considerable portion of their legislative strengths was based on racist members from the south so\nI was saying you can't have a majority ... majority here in politics of this just class based yes it's true that there are more working class people than non working class people but it's not enough because you're then you're handing them wages they can use to drive us apart\nSo there's a chapter about a young man Carlos Ramirez Rosa who's a the first openly gay elected Latino in Chicago he's an older men from the city of Chicago and he's he's important for two reasons one is because\nHe's doing a different kind of big city politics or which is based on not advancing just his own career with being seeing himself very much is part of a movement and being always in a relationship with the movement that he derives his power from as an elected official\nAnd the others because he's doing a kind of really interesting immigrant rights rights organizing and work where in his neighborhood in Chicago around Logan square\nHe uses his older manic office and expense budget to fund classes which are\nSome of the classes are classes and writes for immigrants and some of the classes are called immigration one oh one and their their classes for allies on how to be supportive so that they've\nThey've organized phone trees in his neighborhood in his district so that if if ice shows up to deport family they can get on the phone and have a street full of people lying down ready to be arrested\nSo that the ice or people can't card away a family um so you know I think that's really important work uh there's another chapter about Chuck ... who's the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi\nAnd again he's he's in the book but partly because he's in Mississippi so you can't [laughter]\nYou know somebody said to him well how Donald Trump's election affect your your political work and he said well\nI woke up the day before election I was in Mississippi I woke up after the election day I'm Still in Mississippi were at the bottom of every table you know and it's the most racist state in the country\nAnd he's trying to turn Jackson which is both the state capital and a majority African American city into what he calls the most radical city in the country and he's doing that by these experiments in cooperative economics and\nSeizing vacant and abandoned land and turning it into into gardens to their cooperatively garden and are trying to do economic development in the way that doesn't involve forcing people out\nYou know he's he's trying to square the circle of economic development without gentrification and he's doing it all in the face of a continual racist assault from the Tea Party led Mississippi State government so I think what he's doing is really interesting in may he may not succeed it may not work\nBut he's he's tackling it head on and he's\nShowing a way forward that involves not skating past race not pretending that race doesn't matter but but treating racial justice is central to all his fights he's he's wager\nRight he's part of his success so far the fact that there is for somebody that residents there's so little to lose at this point [noise] well I think part of it is that there's little to lose I'm\nOn the other hand [noise] you know people in Mississippi a particularly in Jackson have ... have been promised so many things that didn't work and so many there have been so many false and betrayed promises that one of the things that he said to me is\nHe said you know I'd like to do all these things but I really got to fix the potholes because if I don't fix the potholes I'm not going to have any credibility and people are and the people can see the potholes you know they they can\nAre decent unsafe so he understands that he's got to deliver on the ... the nuts and bolts as well as the sort of you know program addict ideology [noise]\nWhy don't they don't want to make sure that we touched on because it's easy to have these conversations and talk about the one percent only as those who are working against us\nAnd there are for example the patriotic millionaires who are pretty much devoted to a left wing slashed progressive agenda\nRight now I I don't know if you're acquainted with what's happening in San Francisco with mark Benny off who's a multi billionaire versus Jack Dorsey who's another multi billionaire Benny off is with sales force which is huge and head of sales force and Dorsey is the head of both square and Twitter\nAnd this little micro cosmic thing that's playing out is bending office saying look we're billionaires we need to help the homeless we need to help clean up the streets of San Francisco it's for everybody in Dorsey is saying back I don't really like this particular plan to help the homeless\nAnd now banding office saying you're putting your money we got Seventy billionaires in ... square miles and half of you were just hoarding your money he's calling them out to watch this play out\nAnd to look at the world that you positive as possible in our book I mean there are allies among the one percent and it's fascinating to watch these two philosophies bought up against\nEach other I think they are allies potentially everywhere because I don't think that people's material circumstances determine everything about their lives I'm not that kind of crude material is so [noise] uh and you know and I also think that one of the things that the left needs to be able to do\nIs to take yes for an answer if you say we want to raise taxes we want to spend it on schools and hospitals and housing and somebody says okay then don't say to that person and by the way you're filthy rich person said yes it does you know vote for our candidates for our agenda but I also think that\nYou know part of what Donald Trump represents is to try to not just of capital but it's kind of celebrity as social capital ... and I think that's one of the things that we need to be\nWary of we need to be wary of annoying thing our own counter saviors you know whether there mark vennia for Bernie Sanders I mean\nThe Sanders campaign slogan said it's not me not me us a but Bernie didn't always act that way and I think you know it's important going forward and certainly the next time there's a presidential election that it be us that it be you know movements together\nUh and that doesn't mean we all have to join the same move went by the way that's another reason why I've I've not attempted to suggest or even pretend that everybody in my book knows each other works together they're all holding hands around the campfire singing kumbaya they're not they're each in their separate struggles but they're separate struggles are part of a larger struggle\nAnd most of them recognized that insofar as they are able to eight each other and so far as they're able to be in solidarity they do but it's not it's not about building one big coordinated movement it's about recognizing that each piece is important\nAnd the peace we haven't talked about the woman who's the subject in my last chapters
