San Francisco the time has nine o'clock up next in deep within ... stay tuned\nI'm Angie ... and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic so Mali brought us her book rage becomes or the power of women's anger right after the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings\nThe research in her book indicates that just by virtue of their gender the women in our audience already carried issues with internalized anger and how to express it\nNow we'd be discussing it well women's fury was one of the number one topics in the country ... is a lifelong students of gender inequality issues she made activism her career director of the women's media center speech project she works for women's freedom of expression and against online harassment and abuse\nShe's written for time the birds guardians of the nation huff post and the Atlantic language alert there are two instances of what the FCC considers obscene speech we have bleep those out\nWe started of course with what everyone had been glued to the testimony of the steady\nPolite professor Christine Blasey Ford and the indignities furious red cat how\nWhat were some of your thoughts as you watched the cabinet hearing and as you watched him express all of his anger\n[noise] so I was sad\nAnd angry and depressed I also last because I had never ever thought I'd see a day when a man would use calendar ring\nTo signal Philly all legacy yeah\nSo as he's crying very feminine thing he's saying but I'm the son of a father and I admire my father and human need to tow the patriarchal line even though I'm Crying and I might be a little boy who needs the care of the white women around me\nAnd what were you thinking in terms of how and I do not want to comment on Dr for his presentation herself and I don't want to make any assumptions about what was going on in her head yeah but watching her\nAnd watching how nice she was and how she was smiling through some of her testimony put me in mind when we yeah your woman recounting a trauma and they're so damn nice\nGoing down the rental yes yeah I mean I think that most women would recognize the tight rope she was walking on right be assertive but not too assertive be kind\nBut definitely not angry even though you need to act in self defense what struck me about what she was doing throughout was she kept adjusting right she kept she kept fixing her Mike and she kept saying well does it work for you\nAnd that actually maybe made me fatter than almost anything else because she was actually the only person in the room that should have been able to express indignation and anger at her humiliation\nAnd at the trauma that she was being put through again and yet she was the personal least able to do that\nShe pretty much performed and I think that's the right word in a way that many women are socialized to perform in those situations not because we irrationally think we're going to be punished but because we will be punished right and so she happens to be a white woman which brings us at all kinds of privileges\nA black woman in that situation Anita Hill Thirty years ago is it an even more difficult situation just by being alive and speaking right\nEverything from her posture too the cadence of her voice really address the double standard in their behavior there was that it was quite shocking actually see it play out the way it did\nThe pugnacious hyper masculine sort of I'm angry and I get to be angry and I think it just showed how anger is a social entitlement right he gets to be angry and he gets to exercise that emotion without it degrading anybody sense of his rationality or logic\nWhereas for women were taught to\nBe emotional in terms of regulating our emotions and other people's emotions and are linked with emotion analogy but then the emotion analogy is weaponized against us because there's the assumption that we are not rational and we're not logical and that we're not thinking clearly\nWay back in the classic scenario if she had in front of the public in front of the cameras in front of so many men if she had come out into frankly ... what was she risking\nHer well first of all she was definitely risking her credibility right we we know that there is a credibility gap that exists from many studies that shows that men are assumed to be more authoritative\nMore knowledgeable people have more confidence in them when they give expert testimony uncomplicated issues so that already exist as a gap in our lives and so we often have to bend over backwards to prove ourselves right I mean I have Seventy pages of citations in the book and that's basically because I don't want to argue with awful people all day\nOr they can go argue with the CDC or the United nations or they'll argue way with me anyway right but but in fact we have to go out of our way to proven proven proven prove what we say and at no point in life\nDo we actually\nHave the luxury or privilege of just saying what we know ... and having what we know be taken seriously and so all of her composure\nWas really calibrated to trying to buttress her credibility\nWhereas he could lose his composure and still maintain in some circles credibility mhm I'm so and and we know from many other studies that indeed when men display anger maybe in a courtroom for example there was a recent study done about\nProsecutors in courtrooms that ... they they accrue power so an angry man will convince people to change their minds\nWhere as a woman who displays anger the opposite happened she actually becomes less powerful and people's things she's less credible less trustworthy and um it's not because anything about what she knew changed its because we have these stereotypes about gender and ethnicity\nWhen a woman does get angry with her face and say she's angry when a woman is not angry when her face is in a neutral facial set you have science about how that he's interested in how man faces interpreted differently we don't read men and women is expressions the same way\nNo we don't mean women's faces are expected to be pleasing unpleasant so we're supposed to smile and actually like black people were supposed to smile in order to signal that we're not ... we're not unhappy with the circumstances we find ourselves and mhm right and I I don't know I don't know I I've been told to smile\nProbably at least once a week my entire life\nBy an ad almost always very often by a man I don't know and so it's really irritating to me when someone tells me to smile so we we sort of call a woman's neutral face a resting bitch face and\nI even found surgery that was being advertised as a way to fix resting which face\nA permanently installed permanently I don't\nFault you know but actually it's really kind of an irony because in fact\nMen's faces at rest are bitchy\nAnd we know that because of [noise]\nTo gender neutral faces if a if a face is a gender neutral face but has an expression that we tend to associate with anger most people will say it's a man's face and demands faces at rest it is demonstrably more negative looking than a woman's face at rest\nMhm you also I'm really pleased to see that this is not just about white women that you did incorporate women from all walks of life in here and some of the most interesting points to me came across as to how different those two experiences argue about\nThe difference that you know young black girls have and whether their mothers had been modeling the appropriateness of anger for them as opposed to what a white woman has raised with so can you go into that a bit\nYeah I mean I think that a lot of our standards of behavior are\nPegged to the experiences of I'm white men as our new neutral objective state of humanity and there are lots of examples of that that range from the way we design cities to the way we designed bathrooms to the way we think of the idea of knowledge\nAnd the same things sort of happens in terms of how we think about anger so a lot of this that comment assumptions about girls and women and anger are about upper middle class white girls who were studied\nIn studies for a long time\nBut in fact the experiences of girls of different classes and races and ethnicities and ethnicities are very different\nAnd the point of a lot of the book is about how the emotion is socially constructed so we think of the ... of emotions in general as internal and private particularly if we associate them with women they aren't public and political right but in fact\nOur emotions are socially constructed as anything else we may have them internally but they make demands on the world and then the world response and the way the world responds depends on all of these ideas about our identities and so a young black girl in kindergarten\nAnd on is five times more likely to be suspended or expelled than her peers and she's five times more likely to be expended a suspended or expelled for behaving in ways that don't conform to our ideals of white middle class femininity\nKnow\n\nThis is in deep I'm Angie ... my guest is Russia Molly with her book rage becomes her\nSteve from with the whole idea of the necessity of being sexually desirable and how how ingrained that is a very young age I Wonder what you think about the campaigns that we see with your sexy at any age you're seeing any weight and nobody seems to get around to saying maybe six he shouldn't be the point\nYeah I mean I think that's just sort of\nRight like you don't have to be sexy all the time there are times when maybe it's nice to be sexy but being a sexy dentist really doesn't help you [laughter] so\nSo I think that that kind of framing is just more of the same sort of ridiculous sex segregation that is despite people's protests hierarchical you know I mean men rule that's really not in question I don't really see how anybody can question that\nNot politically and not in the financial world not in the tech world not in academia I mean maybe they don't rule as mothers\n'cause they're not mother's so I think that this idea that we always have to be sexy though is important because in fact\nThe shortest path to a woman's glory or security is vicariously by being attracted to a powerful man ... and that still true we can dress up anyway we want but it's really not denial I think that it's just emblematic of the bigger problems\nAnd I don't know if you saw on the news that it was necessary for and embarrassed costume company to pull yeah they're sick The Handmaid's tale\nNo irony at all irony is dead it's law [laughter]\nGoing into some of the questions here what about man they're not allowed to express emotions how does that affect them\nUm if not and it's a book about women and anger but it's very\nClear that man's performance of masculinity of kissing women off all the time [laughter]\nThat's also not in question right so it would be really healthy if we could on gender the world but specifically an gender emotions in the way we teach children to grow into to people adult people and\nWhat I hear when I hear the question what about men is awfully close to not all men and why are you focusing on women\n... demand and the conversation\nRight and in fact the problem we have is that men are always centered and they may not feel like they're always centered which is part of being always center\nRight so there's a lot to be said about men and their emotions but not here\nCan you can examples of how women can or have made themselves both likeable and aggressive and this goes to how you talk about how important we find like ability to be\nI think that women do understand that there are real price has to be paid if say trans grass in terms of gender roles or the way they act right so a woman who\nLooks pretty typically feminine is more likeable automatically because what she signal\nThe people around her for example there was this great study about\nWomen who wear makeup in the office and it's not that they are necessarily more attractive\nIt's that they're showing the people around them that they've spent money invested in buying the make up to make other people happy\nNow a lot of women say I wear makeup because I Want to wear makeup\nWhich is also true but in fact the way it's translated is the signal that you're conforming mhm and so likability is really important for women we see that in our politicians are women politicians\nAnd I'm to be angry as the kiss of death that makes you really on likeable for many reasons one of the first associations girls have is it being angry makes you ugly again this is a cardinal sin\nIt also makes you quote unquote masculine children by the age of four or five associate anger with masculinity and so when girls are women are angry they're seeing as violating these gender roles\nAnd we saw it in the last election right I mean Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump could stomp been\nHit their ... and looked slightly unhinged and deranged and they could leverage all this populist anger and it wouldn't hurt them it wouldn't make them on likeable but if Hillary Clinton had even come close to that she would have been even more held in disdain\nYou went into some of the behaviors in the book about what what Donald Trump was pulling during the election and one of them how was mystified when this happened at the time\nThat this was an effort on Donald Trump's part to score points and that's when he was shadowing Hillary Clinton around this old days when they were free to walk during the debate and he he hoped behind her and he looked behind her and he found her\nAnd I ... that must have been perceived entirely differently by men that it was by women will run every woman I talked to was like God that's creepy\nWell in the moment I mean in the moment women were horrified to like my God this is a hulking stocking man who's trying to assert\nPhysical dominance on her something that we're all familiar with is generally smaller people right and and so many women automatically associated that with domestic violence and with the kinds of behaviors that abusers engage in also well understood and so yeah I mean I think that even in the immediate moment that that was happening\nYou could see in social media this incredibly gender response to his physical presence on the stage\nIt it was really terrible mhm watch\nSocial media is a major double edged sword when it comes to women trying to be themselves to express their anger I even just God Forbid to have an opinion on something and that is throughout the book as well you have had trouble with social media sure I mean I\nWouldn't really call it trouble it's explicit rape threats graphic pornography of gang rapes and mutilation um death threats that there's a whole range of things you know having your personal information shared\nI'm having threats made against your family I'm the first I'm sort of ...\nAnd if I Am writing about racial justice I could maybe maybe maybe black maybe somewhere\nYou know that's when a lynching threat will happen I also have an Arab sounding name so maybe I'm Muslim So that's when the Islamic phobic threats happen I mean really it it just it just is a mirror on the world right it has nothing to do with me I've had to call the FBI only it\nOnly once did I called the FBI is called the police just to say hey this is happening or hey please be aware that this might happen because there's a technique called swatting which is when somebody calls in a fake report and says there's some criminal activity happening in your house\nInterest because the fact is that a SWAT Team might shoot you write so yes on line there is this\nInsane re assertion of masculine privilege in the most ugly in violent ways that's very easy to see unclear to understand and it's totally global end its networked\nAnd if we'd paid attention to it as an ... enforce that was moving through the culture ten twelve years ago we might not be in this position today\nSomeone the audience wants to know how do you think Kavanaugh testimony would have been received differently if he was a woman and act the way he acted acted away\nYeah [laughter]\nWell I mean is there any doubt we're still having a conversation about whether this\nMan can be judicious\nYou know whether his sort of sanctimonious outraged entitled aspect can be a fair reflection of visibility to make decisions I mean\nBy hand me actually wrong where she had and you see happening is true yeah I mean there are so many mhm they're just I'm ... I'm I'm struggling to come up with some right now but I Do list\nThem in the book because you have to at least laugh a little you know\nWe have Rebecca foolish here and she and she's in the book as well as you explained to is the one night that there was a person just as you are in using her book against her and ... and she had said several times I wrote that this money just didn't hear I wrote that and he just went on and I literally couldn't credit her with writing the book\nOh he was telling her about her book [laughter]\nShe's so gracious you know and so that's how she ended up joining the romance planning which she herself doesn't like she doesn't like the term she thinks it's too much of a generalization\nUm but yeah she did that and he went on and then when it finally her companion said stop what you're doing like this is you know she she wrote this book he just picked up his toys and left\nLiterally just heard and walked away [laughter]\nPeople are asking you about the price that you pay yeah when you decide to be a straightforward woman be emotional beat angry whatever mhm how can women especially Asian American women break away from stereotypes without losing credibility and I'll back to back that was another question about what if you lose opportunities\nSo chances are you will lose opportunities\nAnd that's hard because you have to make that assessment constantly what am I willing to risk what is it worth to me how ... because we all get fed up which is one of the virtues of aging I think this happens on many levels right there's the inter personal level the professional level the political level it's very\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to Indy I'm Angie ... ... is my guest a sensitive four letter word pops up in this segment is leap but I wanted to give you a heads up ... Hitler's books\nOne or two girls so early and so thoroughly get the idea\nThat we are going to be rates that that is that rate is\nEverywhere it's what every girl needs to you know I\nLearned to walk with my keys between my fingers before a I had keys and B I didn't hear the what rape really was I knew that a girl would be attacked and as soon as I got my car keys I wouldn't go down the street without them between my fingers right I Am really know what rape was but I assumed I Would be assault and where do we get that\n[noise] so I think it's everywhere right we get it from a culture that shame people for their sexuality and polices girls' clothing and tell them that the way they dress will hurt them right we get it from um\nThese rules about staying safe which we learn really early I mean\nI got really angry when people make jokes about women going to the bathroom together\nYou know really snide commentary about women being vain or never being able to just go to the bathroom quickly and alone I'm like now I'm the kill joy at dinner I'm like what are you talking about we teach girls to do that so they won't get raped by men like before I'm sick so I Can't go to the bathroom by myself when I'm six every time I got up\nI had to have a companion right and I had to do with five other girls and so it's sort of just in the air I Will add though that it's excessive rights ... and it's based on rape missed because boys and girls are equally likely to be molested\nBefore the age of sort of ten or twelve boys age out of that generally speaking and girls and women never do you can be an eighty year old woman walking through Central Park and be raped [noise]\nYeah I mean I think that part of the problem with a deeply conservative culture that we live in\nIs that it necessarily involves portraying men as unable to control themselves in in need of sex which is of course different from rape but in need of this ... this physical urge and of women being tempting all the time\nMhm there's very surprised to find out in the book in surveys conservative women have the most anger\nThey did before the election they've handled at the time [laughter]\nWhat was that about what we're we're we're sending are coming from\nA lot of things one aspect that I haven't seen well studied\nIs from inequality conservative women\nLive with this much more rigid set of rules about men and women and their roles in society very often they're Catholic or Protestants evangelical in this country those are really authoritarian religions they have strict rules they punish people when they break those rules they're fuelled by a lot of contempt and disgusting fear\nWhen you face one form of inequality you leverage another form of status so if you're a conservative white woman and you're living in an environment in which complementary and is is the rule which is actually public power for men\nPrivate power for women which is not an equal occasion the equation anyway you can leverage your racial power to gain status right so I think that's what we saw in this election white women were able to assert racial privilege to offset gender inequality\nWhite women who are conservatives now they've jumped ship\nThey've jumped ship so far that even Steve Bannon left [laughter] right Steve Bannon's like the white women who've left I'm going to Europe to organize the fascist and so I think that there's a lot in the culture are very religious culture\nThat points to what's happening and the rest of the world which is that authoritarianism is on the rise everywhere and it is most likely to be adopted\nFirst by women in profoundly unequal situations and that doesn't matter what country you're in and we never paused to think that maybe the inequality of white women in their own homes in this country is related to authoritarian beliefs but I think it is and because white men were distressed and\nWhite women and men tend to be married more likely to one another you don't want to see the people around your distressed you know you don't want to see your husband or your father or your son's in that frame of mind\nAnd so what women all women tend to experience at much higher levels is vicarious stress which is that we take on the emotions of the people around us and ... and that becomes sort of part of our our lives and our anger\nWomen who are starting to assert their anger or learning how to win and the whole end of your book is about how to claim your your own rage\nThey may be disturbed or alarmed at how it comes out the woman who burst into tears trying to express and said she ... she has to do that a ... burden of being the crying women right so can you walk women through that step of learning what their own anger looks like\nI'm so every chapter in the book is sort of an examination of different stages of life\nAnd in each one of those chapters I Try and provide examples of what it looks like when we can't recognize acknowledge are articulated anger\nAnd so crying is a big deal because I honestly believe that if men understood how angry women were when they cry they would be shocked\nRight women cry because they cannot get the words out\nBecause to get the words out it's scary to say how angry they are\nAnd crying then reinforces femininity right so you feel this incredible anger that in your brain you've been taught to think of his masculine and what's the feminine thing that you do you can cry and it sort of dissipate some of the transgression of having this powerful masculine emotion\nAnd I don't suggest it's conscious at all I just think it's the way we learn to operate\nAnd um [noise] so yes I mean I think there are clearly women who have explosive rage we all know women who act that way but that's also a missed\nOut in a way that not useful I mean I started the book with a story of my mother who when I was Fifteen I came home one day and um she was standing on a terrorists overlooking a hill and she was throwing her China each one or the time it like a Frisbee\nShe what I'm saying anything she must have thrown twenty plates like out into the air and off they went and this is not normal right here like Fifteen or like gee what is happening and she came in back in and she looked at me and she said and how was your day\n[laughter] and I didn't ask her what was wrong because I was like that is not a good idea right now I think I'll go do my homework but I asked her something like Thirty years later\nI said do you remember this happening and she said oh that was just one time [laughter] he said I brought so many more place than that but the the thing about her doing that was\nThat she didn't talk about it so I learned she was she didn't fertilize it\nIt was scary and dangerous things were breaking and I didn't know why\nShe didn't impose her anger on her family she does but a lot of women do we tend to learn about models of anger say anger in an anger out you keep your anger enter you keep your anger out\nBut in fact women that's not a model for most women women it's relationship in our relationship out which is totally different what she did was get her anger out but she kept it out for a relationship\nAnd that's the model of women's anger men's anger which is another standard that were held to is it tends to be anger in anger out\nBut I'm all for checking the mail standard of our behavior and that's one of the examples of that\nSomebody brings up that we could change the way we talk about violence against women for example men attacked women attacks don't happen to women\nYes all of the change from passive to active language ... um is very important\n[noise] you said that Bush should be allowed to cry but earlier you called cabinet ... little boy yes how should we interpret the those two signals\nOh well I think we have a long history of conservative men sobbing right and in public in ways that women are not allowed to cry in public I mean\nYou know if Hillary Clinton had cried\nIn theory authentic Jersey right she was constantly being a denounce for her in authenticity\nBut if she cried like that she would have been perceived automatically is weak and hormonal and incapable of sound judgment\nBut over and over again we have these examples of men crying they tend in in interestingly I think someone pointed that does opt to me they tend to often to be conservative men and there's a really interesting dynamic in that which is that\nIn sort of this I'm very stratified sex roles of men and women in conservative cultures\nAll women are expected to mother\nRight they're all supposed to care and they're supposed to actually mother their husbands like how many people say I have three children but for us you count my husband\nHow many people say that and it's so common right and can I curse yeah oh I I tend to curse a lot I'm trying not to but I was sitting with another writer last week she was hilarious or names come in time for it and she's written a book called boys will be boys and she looked at this crowd and she said yes but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "city": "San
