{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Up next at nine o'clock Eighteen deep with Angie ... state\nI'm Angie Cairo and this is in deep one full hour on one intriguing topic\nMary Robinson was the first woman president of Ireland she didn't seek political office out of sheer ego or from yourself aggrandizement if she had she could have taken her long list of accomplishments her work in law academia then asked president of Ireland\nAnd called the day but instead she took on the mantle of the un high commissioner for human rights I don't know that same passion she publicly challenged America's human rights violations in the wake of nine eleven\nPresident Brock Obama awarded her the presidential medal of freedom in two thousand nine she founded the Mary Robinson foundation for climate justice eight years ago\nLast month the global climate action summit brought her to the bay area just as she ... her new book climate justice hope resilience and the fight for a sustainable future\nThe book collect stories from around the world about individuals who've taken a stand against global warming and had marked effect on the people and environment around them from a hairdresser in the American south to a defiant young nomadic early and chat\nThey transform themselves into effect is influential climate activist later this hour we'll hear from one of her subjects but we started by talking about Natalie in Australia who slowly started to question the impact of her own very comfortable life\nYeah I was lucky enough to meet ... several times in Australia when she began her one million women project and she kind of explained to me what she was trying to do and it wasn't actually going very successfully to her surprise because she had\nFound when she decided to take decisions in her home to have the right light bulbs to turn switches off to eventually abandoned her car which was the hardest one and that but she could save the hustle budgets\nAnd she felt well this is grace if I could just skip other women to do this we can all reduce our carbon footprint the one million wouldn't ... women found it it'd be easy but\nIt wasn't easy because for so many people it was you know I so many things in my life and this was an adult and it wasn't central mhm it had become very central for naturally you know she got very charged up about ... and I've watched\nHow she went back to the drawing board little bits and said I Need enough to make it easier for people need to do more things to help to make people realize that this is very serious\nAnd that's what he's here at the conference I've I've met her several times and uh actually I was just before this I was talking to a group of Irish bar on women most of the marriage for and who are here\nThe bay area generally I'm doing well in business\nAnd the other's consul general brought them together to talk with me and we were talking about women's leadership and the example I used was naturally mhm because she's the examples that we can all learn from the you know what I really like about her was that she had the vision\nAnd even though it it wasn't so easy she kept with such an modified lived up to ...\nTo make it better and now she has a very credible amount of followers some and some were eight hundred thousand or something who does not bother if you're looking for a million\nOther she learned the same thing that you've learned which is that you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good exactly can't do it for you fly a lot but yeah if I Try\nI Love note to let my voice trouble you know I Do a lot of videos for conferences for my foundation offsets obviously when I traveled 'cause we're very conscious of the carbon emissions are but if you want to convince people if you want to make the case if you're ...\nThe book has to travel here so that her voice would be heard at this conference which is extraordinarily important if you wanted to convince people if you want to make the case [noise]\nWe have to sometimes be there and you know that's clearly I think the problem but then I Know that every day we are to the problem and that's part of our responsibility was no getting away from us\nRight and obviously going to talk a lot more about the book but I Want to talk about what's been happening in San Francisco it is quite to do there are celebrities there are big money companies that are pledging investments and research and investigation\nThere protesters outside they say it's too much window dressing going on there's not enough real action so what's been your part in all this last couple of days\nI think it's very important that there is a civil society that is protesting and wanting more and they have every reason to do is because we're not on track for say for us and [noise]\nWhat was actually being said especially by the scientists I've been on a panel twice now at this conference with Johan rocks from um of the punishment boundaries project in Sweden\nAnd he scares the living daylights out of me and then he kind of puts a positive way that we have time and that there were new energy is coming cheaper it we can do this and he's just issued a report with Christiana forget ... a road map of how we need to get there and um he gave me the copy of this and I kind of tried to look at somebody but it you know I'm not a scientist\nBut I really respect the fact that we are getting closer to that tipping points much earlier than science of ... and that's serious because we are the only\nA generation such fully understands the dangers of climate change except for those stupid I don't even call them climate deniers I called them fossil fuel\nHarvard has in the pocket of fossil fuel level they are and I have because nobody in their senses can deny climate change in our world today nobody I don't actually be anybody in good faith can stand up and say I don't believe in climate change it's not it's not possible\nBut ... and what we do know is that we have enough time just just enough time to change course enough and we must do it more radically must not have business as usual mostly transformative not unless we have civil society marching and pushing\nI took power to the big march in twenty fourteen and before the climate summit the Ban Ki moon hatch and before the Paris Agreement\nAnd I was marching along with a group of elders The Elders Nelson Mandela brought together that I'm privileged to belong to and I was working with Gruber influence of the Brunson commission of great pleasure to be walking with her as well because she's the mother of sustainable development if you like\nAnd um we've a wedge together and it was hard to move and we weren't actually making much progress we were slowly moving along because we're so many of the four hundred thousand people in in the streets of New York\nAnd I saw a sign not very far away but I really really wanted to get behind really wants to get behind because he was angry grannies [laughter]\nWith everything you know angry ground [laughter] and we need the hungry ground news and the you know the protest that says I Want the safe world for my children or grandchildren\nBecause you brought up trumping the beginning of the book we have to go there [laughter] I Know you have\nThe vision um someone looking\nOutside in and meanwhile we're living here and I think they might be difficult\nFor people who feel like\nJerry Brown who is our leadership in the state but then there's\nActively doing legislation to make things worse ... how does the international community [noise] make it best move against that\nThe international community is extraordinarily aware of this for obvious reasons and uh you know what happens in America politics with America's followed all over the world as you know is weakening America is\nIn the short term at least damaging the reputation of America and its allowing China\nTo become a kind of leader a leader anyway on solar and electric cars and other you know but it's also\nBecoming a leader almost all the values of globalization yes even though China has its own way of articulation those venues and it's not necessarily always\nAnd you know very much and the full democratic tradition to say the least and so it's not helpful what when President Trump said he was pulling the United states out of the Paris Agreement which technically cannot do until the fourth of November twenty twenty and you know when your next presidential election is so that'll be interesting [laughter]\nEm eh when he did that it actually\nSlowed the momentum of powers it means that other countries have\nEased up a bit there isn't the same driving pressure but was very important for parents were two things one was that the United states and China President Obama and present she forged a relationship that they would\nSupport a Paris agreements and you had the high ambition coalition which was led by the Marshall Islands\nTiny up told Marshall Islands and Tony ... who has since died who was the foreign minister remind you of the friends he just persuade us he talked about ... do you want my islands to go under do want us to lose our sovereignty you know can you\nCan you really do this to us and he was so persuasive that he managed to get this fair but weak agreement because there isn't much enforcement power in the ...\nWhat I Do value and what we're seeing here at this California action climate action and some of ... is that when President Trump said that and I make this clear in the book it was very important to see the extraordinary coalition of we are still in of\nThis is in deep I'm Angie ... talking to Mary Robinson former president of Ireland about her new book climate justice conscious and Uganda and then indigenous people in Alaska and then what was happening in Vietnam in a lot not all but a lot of these cases\nThese are small areas it not only has not a great deal of money but they don't have a lack of communication there aren't news bureaus they're sending out pictures all the time thing people are dying to land is no longer arable\nI Wonder if this were more in our faces by our I mean to western developed world it would be so much harder to walk away from it\nThat's a very good point that's something that I Believe firmly and we need to know about the lives of people\nAnd their attempts to be very resilience despite the fact that they have no insurance no money on the side just how brave and courageously are many of them and what they're trying to do and some of them are stories of the United states I mean to the stories are stories from different parts of the United states after\nKatrina be facts the Charles ... who had been a hairdresser in east bloc see a woman of color whose father had been involved in the civil rights movement but she was just a nice woman and nobody would tell the stories on her cell phone and that was is and then it was completely destroyed and she had to kind of\nFind the courage\nTo become an organizer but she never thought she would be an she was quite funny about you know I never thought I'd be the one to be organizing women in my area and the community\nTo be more resilience of start fighting back after Katrina which of course hit communities of color far more than others as we know that's very much a factor in climate justice\nAnd when she came to Copenhagen she ... and ... was the book Mississippi girls you know I was going to an end to see you know a woman from eastern Uganda under showering from east Biloxi\nUm both of them distressed by climate telling their stories of climate wise women and from different but but actually one of them in the richest country in the world I'm a nevertheless brushed looking for ... ... ...\nLet's see what happens with the car learn of that will be ... I'm sure of the Carolinas north and South Carolina that will be poor parts I don't know myself\nBut I fear for some communities there may be whether they will be really badly his and be how long it will take them to recover lights it's it's if it's the injustice the unfairness ...\nIt's very frustrating when you're trying to after reality in some people's eyes it climate change is happening it is having an impact on people in our own country\nAnd the president comes out and said they didn't die that's very difficult to and how how can you educate when national leadership that's coming down on griping there's really no answer\nThat [laughter]\nI actually I repeat what I said I don't think there's anybody know who doesn't know that\nBut I don't think anybody who doesn't know the mountains anybody who is trying to deny it was just doing it for a purpose short term getting fulfill few promotion muddying the science we know it's it's tobacco industry on on steroids [laughter]\nYeah one of the things that I enjoyed in the picture you paint it as Sharon and I think we saw the growth in every one you profile as as\nThere is just as beautiful moment where she gets planted garden any garden hadn't happened before and she mentioned her table I Love that she made a table but when she saw it a little ... coming up through their answers practically dance and it's just a moment of realizing that she had control over this tiny part of the earth yeah it was after her\nYeah yeah I Know that that was a lovely moment soon and\nShe's a slightly tragic figure because\nUm when I really wanted to delve more into our story we discovered that she'd had a very serious heart attack on um wasn't able to communicate and she could communicate to her daughter with difficulty and the one thing her daughter said his showering once for a story ... so we actually\nYou know told us um you know right up front yeah I'm a real right up front to but also uh we we went to great lengths to make sure that um her story be told them achieve would once told you know right so yeah\nThere's some Lebanon here and there with how far one can go I mean there's a lot of hope a lot of progress and\nBut then for example with not only and I think there's a new major coal mine going up in Australia and if I'm pronouncing this correctly ... yeah that's an island nation that is going to disappear and you profiled the outgoing president he's frustrated because the incoming government yep\nDoes make it a priority ...\nYeah that's you have to power hardly for religious\nReasons yeah partly for religious reasons and you know God will look after his right you know which is a problem [laughter] um but ... but\nI think I'm really keen to do is to see how we can make this\nAnd something that people take personally no I understand\nThat and this is something I Need to be engaged and because it's happening to people it's happening now this is how they're responding and it's in rich countries in poor countries I mean we we also have the dish example Sammy and a Johnny ... stuff that's on right now I'm In I'm a I mean\nShe she's a wonderful young woman she dresses and this lovely ... dress\nAnd she spoke very well at the Paris Agreement she's a woman who had the benefit of education has a degree in chemistry has had racism racists questions you're not a real member of the many cultural you I mean your education you know I mean you couldn't possibly be and you know and that's\nAlso part of the story but I was asked to serve on the panel the European Parliament\nAnd I asked who else would be on the panel it was a panel about climate justice levels the important thing was the women's committee of the parliament and to have the European parliament's have a a panel session in the in the in the in the parliament on women's leadership on climate justice was important those words even\nAnd so I was happy to do it but I Want to know who else was there and we were told that and that would be a commissioner of the day and I said well what about the voice of\nSomebody from grassroots soon as they and they said we couldn't do that and I said well why not a well you know we can't do that really and I said well if my foundation brings somebody would do less her you know and we proposed Johnny ethic and of course she stole the show\nBecause she told the story of being a reindeer farmer she told the story of the fact is\nA predictable way old was well\nBecause the reindeer could smell the nurture under FISA snow and you know ... and it's like an budge with this change from coal to suddenly warmer and then you get to ten sheets of ice\nAnd they range it would not be able to smells through the eyes and they would walk further and further and so with the herders on both rangers and herders would fall on the thin ice and die in quite a number died and this was a real real problem\nAh then she paused and with great kind of dignity and she said so I'm really glad that here in the European Parliament you have to sign it to have this meeting on women's leadership and climate justice what took you so long\n[laughter] twenty six year olds to you know\nWe need more of that kind of um I don't know it's just a it was just a lovely moment yeah of course she got a standing ovation but you know [laughter]\nThat her case in front of the other cases it seems that because of of racial prejudice or prejudice against what we consider an educated\nThere's first hand knowledge from the farmer and the migrant people I think they know the first you know what's happening here but they're first hand knowledge is locked yeah is that the prejudice is really\n... Hindu who is in the book cars sitting here in the front row beside my husband Nick spoke\nVery well this morning on a panel in front of investors and the next to this group of young uh went off to potential investors and climate change and they're actually a good group and they seem to have and good values\nBut she spoke very eloquently even about the Paris Agreement and I said afterwards that I as usual I learn something when I listened to him do what I learned was and it's true that the Paris Agreement is it is important for human rights\nAnd because ... and discuss you know references a whole range of human rights in the preamble notably uppers of text but in the offers of text it talks about indigenous knowledge as being important for conserving so as she puts it was and I think it's a points\nSo you take the indigenous knowledge is power just like bits don't concede the business writes in the upper as far as you know it was a very interesting points and I've learned so much from being lucky enough to listen to a lot of indigenous\nWisdom guardians of the seats those who've preserve the forest of the story in Vietnam of how to you know work at a level where everybody can participate and preserve the forest and the fruits of the forest and the ... the forest and you know ... it's it's very compelling\n\n\nIt in deep I'm Angie ... with Mary Robinson her book it's climate justice in the audience it's world can only handle one important issue at a time what's the most important women's equality economic equality or climate justice you actually look at that as an issue of intersection out you can't really put one from the other\nWell what I Would say an again I heard a joke in a restaurant say this as a scientist yesterday on the panel he was the same question and he said the difference is\nThat there are all these issues but climate change is the existential trash is the stretched to the future\nNot just of a human beings as to how we will survive the shocks of climate to be go to three or four degrees Celsius and five degrees but you know the world bank has brought her reports are lots of reports of how appalling that would be but also you know we're out of balance with the earth\nSo we need to do more restores at work we need to really get back into balance in order to restore bio diversity and get rid of the acidity of the oceans you know really work\nAnd to ensure that we have that sustainable future and that's why the sustainable development goals are very important but I suppose\nThe other equivalent threats are\nThe nuclear threats it's their you know we could see a lot of destruction of the um we could see 'em some you know terrible I'm I'm pandemics\nEm people fear that suffer but the one that I'm most aware of and most conscious solve is the climate threats and that we have this window of time which our children and grandchildren will tough if we don't take steps\nAnd you know have the country or would you change which we are beginning to have I mean that's\nThat's the prisoner ... I mean we I Do see a lot of change I see a lot more awareness and I see companies and and philanthropy and solar when they're all becoming cheaper and joke in a row strum said yesterday that I'm Sorry you have real strong that said by twenty thirty\nHe believes that fifty percent at least of the energy of the world will be clean\nHe was challenged by somebody in the hole and he said that is our predicts the moment on business as usual\nWe can make it better if we are game and it was a nice answer you know that is our predictions on business as usual and because it's coming down so quickly when you get to fifty percent and we're new energy you know\nThey are stranded ...\nWhen I heard first heard that expression stranded us it's a you know your question you know you look to question to me I said what's a stranded S's and the person that I said think justice justice is too dangerous to use too dangerous even to be you\nKnow in contact with who you love to see that idea penetrate well it's it's a merging you know why you kind of change of feminist issue M well let me explain a very careful here [laughter] our podcast is called\nMothers of invention\nAnd we say that climate change is a manmade problem and requires a feminist solution [laughter]\nWhen we say manmade problem that of course includes women that's a generic manmade problem in may ... human laid problem\nAnd feminism does not exclude men happily more and more men are describing themselves including prime minister is like a ... Justin Trudeau of Canada and many of those\nUm as being feminist and wanting some and it's more um to me the that approach is based on a real understanding of the color see between men and women and an inclusive approach and the approach based on Venus are that are basically the values of the sustainable development\nGoals mhm yeah I'm afraid of that answer no I just I just know that um it needs explaining okay yep got no afraid of us I'm very proud of it [laughter]\nI remember asking about the role of population growth in climate change is that something that needs to be controlled it's a very important\nQuestion but it's the wrong question\nUm because it it it kind of books but the control would be from the outside\nWe need to do what we can and should do to reduce population absolutely mostly can and should do to reduce population is education women and girls and have health systems that work to cut down on maternal and child pornography [noise]\nWell in European countries and in and indeed and Europe is not becoming an aging population because what too well in some senses were not renewing our populations enough them out as a bit better than some other countries but but the point really is\nAnd and that is the only way and we're in a situation and you know let me um you know give you the personal sense I have the knick has heard me say this over and over again and it you know he's involved as well it's our grandchildren but we're lucky enough\nTo have six grandchildren and of our three children\nAnd they've even done the boy girl boy girl boy girl [laughter] wonderful [noise]\nThe oldest is fourteen and they will be in their thirties and forties in twenty fifty and they would share the world we know with about nine and a half billion people that's that's kind of baked in\nIf we don't get that education to women and girls in good health systems in the country's a high population growth and then it it will go to ten billion\nVery quickly after that and maybe twelve billion of the world would find it very difficult to tolerate that so um yes we need to help countries I was in the lobby and not long ago I was my church does it ... and and\nIdentify in population terms with monopoly or in the Nineteen sixties mommy has the same population\nTreatment them cremated and\nHumid and [laughter] and\nIn Ireland we have now four point eight million in\nThe lobby they have at least Fifteen million but that's not the points at least Fifteen million you know it's just a little bit how they they've a census now so but they know sharply more accurately\nBut by twenty fifty they wouldn't have fifty ... ...\nThat's the thing now how do you plan for how do you plan for schools or the plan for hospitals or do you plan for jobs or they plan you know yeah it's a and that is the story of Africa that's the population would double by shortly after twenty fifty\nAnd planning for climate change is planning for that and these are all inextricably linked next\nAppealing to me that if you have stressed and you know because of climate ... M food production I'm an stressed water water being a very big issue\nAnd at the end we're not getting support for the clean energy which would help enormously on all of these issues and yet there are um you know there are a billion people in our world today and the twenty first century who never switched to switch for electricity\nWe've got to quite a number of them\nBut the ones that we now need to get to earn more rural communities more andme slum areas in big cities harder to guess and yet it would make a huge difference for their lives\nIf we can get them the energy to come out of the deep poverty and become productive become alternate ... you know and have little businesses\nAnd which is what happens when they got the energy\nI'm very pleased to say that you brought along kind of a surprise guest with us and we're going to transition to that I Do want to ask you one last question you were addressing a group and you use the phrase that I'd never heard before you talked about trying to bring people into the solutions and the benefits of climate change\nEver heard anybody talk about the benefits climate change before\nBut it's the benefits of and how we are moving to the clean energy world\nSo it's the benefits of the upgrades energy in particular the distributors and solar panels on small groove 'em at all the systems that exists only and there are a lot of people and working on this I keep missing them sold her sisters love people India lots of people and but it's it's not enough\nAnd it it's almost and frustrating that we're not understanding that we should be doing this we should we should we should have governments together saying in the next five years we will work on this and nobody would be without clean energy in the poorest parts of the world nobody\nWould get you know it's it's actually do [noise]\nIf it was a priority of leaving nobody behind of prioritizing the further behind first which is what is said and the and and the twenty thirty agenda and and just the difference that would make two women in particular because it frees up time they don't have to go ... miles for far woods\nFirewood destroying please an undermining\nI'm In a way there's ... understood very well with the need to replant and re forest and in order to uh have the soil and have the security and have the food production that goes with us and I liked projects like draw down and others that are trying to have not just", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "03"}
