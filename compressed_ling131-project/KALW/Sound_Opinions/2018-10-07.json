Chicago NPR actually this is sound opinions I'm Jim ...\nAnd I'm Greg caught this week our guest is Wayne Kramer musician and lead guitarist for the legendary Detroit rock band MC five it was just the lows of addiction in prison and the high performing live if\nMusicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're\nThe fleet will also reviewed new music from hip hop artist NO NAME and pay tribute to late Chicago blues legend\nOtis Rush that's all coming up unsound opinions\nFound opinions as supportive I guess that was their company Chicago craft or if that works to innovate new ways to brew an age they're more apt to silence dot com you don't need to be the only theory drank we just want to be the best theory drink\nYou're listening to sound opinions and later on we'll talk with musician Wayne Kramer legendary guitarist for the Detroit banned the MC five currently on tour celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of that band signature debut kick out the jams\nWill talk to wane about his new memoir is struggles with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turned his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush [laughter]\n\nLet his oldest Russia with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eighty four Jim not as well known as some of the great a Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon even touting guy Howlin' Wolf [noise]\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them are really important a figure in the Chicago blues in beginning in the fifties in fact if you'd only recorded those sites that he did with Kobe records here in the fifties for over a two year period\nOf fifty six through fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars you had a long career after that suffered a stroke and the two thousand and three that you're centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen\nYears of his life but his legacy is huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kind of merger\nThat was so hip Twenty years later\nOr or or a decade later started with people like Hendricks oldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bar scene in Chicago and you can hear it in his guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side lose\nIn the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that oldest rush used the horn section instead of a harmonica player in his bands\nBut there was also an intensity to the sound that old is a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there were protests music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gone said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nA you know he'd always be smiling on those album covers yeah if you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and he was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't know\nDamn hard times and bills and this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck\nYou know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every note he played his guitar player was extraordinary but it was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf this as a performer was not only could he play the guitar but man that guy could sing as well here's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kid in his early twenties\nAnd listen to the intensity beat the very adult nature of the English in this man's voice double trouble from Otis Rush on sound opinions\n\n\n\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nAnd\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room to twenty five the first proper album by an artist who goes by NO NAME she does have a name when he Warner grew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago\nOr mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene a collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation Greg Mick Jenkins chance the rapper Donny Trump at the social experiment\nMeal of woods uh twenty sixteen got a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone now comes a full album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another dealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song\nCalled NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from room twenty five on sound opinions\n[noise]\n\nFor the small town in ... and you see that happening and I felt that my cancer none of the\n... with Canada\nJust from my\nIs on the right thing\nAnd he didn't and going from a camp there\n[noise] I mean and I have is lying\nOn the on that at that\n\nThat is NO NAME with a track called NO NAME from her new record room twenty five gym a lot of discussion about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what he called herself known as the questions you get asked a lot of interviews\nAnd you know I think she's trying to addressing that in this record um the whole idea of identity what does it mean uh I think it's the subtext of almost every track on this record is that society\nTries to a race African American people tried to make them invisible women's I've been especially yes and you know stripping of your pride your dignity your identity that's that's the essence of life or so she becomes known him and embraces this reality\nOr you're you're on a rock band that does make some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar or the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time\nFelt like we were um\nServing the power structure but clearly used everything they held against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before a court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate ... so our white panther wiretapped case led to the downfall of Richard Nixon\nI basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book you've heard of openly admitting you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these sort of Abe ... hours of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I wanted to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I taught mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at the Chrysler was going to amount to much but the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act you know democracy is participatory it's not just the word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it and I protested with everything that I had\nAnd I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifty sexual morality\nMarijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and um [noise] I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n\n[noise]\nRight in the middle of the sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only against the where the number of bands were invited play you were the only band that actually did play at the convention a sort of a as a part of uh\nOf what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day in sixty eight or because of the riots started to flow downhill pretty much as soon as you got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there was a good vibe it was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson trace it goes\nThrough the crowd knocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting fist fights with kids a roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and uh you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the ban once we finished our set and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on they focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with the ... swinging batons and and you had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw happening on the nightly news you know they had never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporters like that and\n\nIt plain that after the MC five such intensity of blaze so bright for a short period of time you go into the recording is check it out and\nAnd it's a real super intense studio experience and you seem to have mixed feelings about that I'm Still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach\n[noise] well we had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time\nTo learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff ... and check out the germs was recorded lives\nSo I'm back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our approach in order to be better musicians to be a better\n[noise]\nI have mixed feelings but [noise] um\nI I Know each album intimately I Know\nWhat their strengths and what their weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism\nThat we were so undisciplined and so irresponsible [laughter] musically irresponsible idiosyncratic that that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on that the temples war solid and that the guitars we're in tune and that the singing\nWe're very ... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great ... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your quite excellent solo career you know will always say the records or break but it's live\n... what happens live I mean that's where I think if some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand as I understand what you guys took from jazz\nAnd and what you as a as a as a musician and a person of taken from jazz is that spontaneity unique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\n[noise] yeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do\nWhere everything works beautifully that you are human beings doing a most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously and it actually never gets any better than that there's a lot and I've I've had my share of\nOf great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand and and everybody is just playing at the at the peak of their ability and the crowd is right there with you and\nThen the lights are writer and everyone looks good and we sound good\nAnd that's as good as it gets this those moments I I Try to grab a kiss from joy as it passes by\nOf all time um uh so yeah of course if or when Danny Fields\nSaid does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five which really just seemed like\nThe [noise]\nYou know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise and we're all smoked the same passion we always have the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nIf you think about the characters you know coming through that scene again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper the time but you wouldn't even just a little bit later I guess a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all your characters I mean we're was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we had all been together with all known each other\nGoing back to the record hop days where we're all show up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and and uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between\nLaw the a Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time I mean Detroit was thriving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible and\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nOne of the um hottest thing I've found to have a good buddy whose name is ... she\nAnd I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place at the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just ... I mean he's about he's about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah\nYou know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of work and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo ah to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that through his uh his hunting and outdoorsman\nHobby that was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I I we remained friends or I could call them up today and we could have a pleasant conversation um but we have not we have yet to have a real substance of political shape and I and I I'm open to it\nGood in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people and I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I\nTo one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped\n... you know he's got this this pillow in the back\nOf his ... ... it\nJust struck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there\n[noise]\n\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences and that most turbulent time of\nThe sixties we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne that still the case today I mean you playing a lot of different guys as you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you just you know um it does it still have that power do you believe in yeah\nSure does our our ... will always have the power to make a connection between people\nTo to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music\nIf I tell the truth about how I feel about something chances are there's somebody else out there that felt the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case now out here you know somebody else's deals where because ultimately\nArt confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together actually\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm reading\nOne when the MC five fell apart and then you go down your passive of drug abuse crimes wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there\nBetween you and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob Steiner you you you say like ... I mean you deal with each passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the break up a band nothing was ever resolved or we never got to know each other as grown ups and it it's just left as open wound or star a and [noise]\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to to ah\nPeople leave before their time even if even if it is a natural I mean what what is a natural death for me yeah right you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em but you know we never got to ... we never got a chance to to\nThrough together I I think we probably none of us really survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to walk through the fire and and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say that friendships and the camaraderie the undermining of all that and\nSee at one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard\n...\nVan [noise] boom [noise] ... do\nTell us about a ... you have the second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based on on the west coast um what is what does that world like how did you get into it\nWell I knew I knew that day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again\nYeah yeah there is a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticize it but it's leaving how sleeping on the floor night after night if yeah it's it's hard work\nAnd and uh you know I I thought I could\nDo some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh and in movies and saw my could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this\nBut when I finally moved to LA and started to pursue it seriously are just got a few jobs and then I discovered I Need to go back to school so I started taking a scoring classes at UCLA\nAnd the union has some good orchestrating classes running at the time\n'cause I had to learn the same thing that all composers have to learn the language of the orchestra having been in a rock band all my life didn't really prepare me for where did the violins go and where did the French horn goal and you know what the articulation that you might use armed brass to give you the effect that you want for the scene", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "07"}
