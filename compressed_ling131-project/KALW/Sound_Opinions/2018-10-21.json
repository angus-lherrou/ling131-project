{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Tomorrow afternoon at five thirty here on KLW in San Francisco [noise]\n\nRum WB easy Chicago NPR and this is sound opinions I'm Jim ... got a great catch this week we talked with Susan Jacobs the music supervisor for HBO's sharp objects it's her job to pick songs to elevate the visual to another level\nI mean it's always conveying the emotion that the director wants to convey as you know people need to get the point of view are chopped supervisors is\nA different point of view that are possible plus we'll review new albums from prince and singer songwriter Sam fellow\nThat's all coming up on sound opinions\nSound opinions as supportive I guess that was their company Chicago crap theory that works to innovate new ways to prevent an age fear more apt to silence dot com you don't need to be the only theory drank we just want to be the best theory drink\nListening to sound opinions and a leader in the show Jim we're going to talk with Susan Jacobs she's an Emmy winning music supervisor that means she's the person that picks the songs you hear in shows like a sharp objects and big little lies she's also been the music supervisor for a number of movies working with people like Spike Lee David all Russell\nOn and on she'll talk with us about how she decides what's the perfect song for every scene and how she got let sampling of all people to agree to their music being used as coming up later in the show Greg but first we've got some new music [noise]\nNever met the man oh\nGod [noise]\nNo not the you\nKnow\nThere is a snippet of purple rain everybody knows that right oh yeah the great prince as you can tell very sparse a stripped down version in its initial stages a purple rain\nThese are demo recordings are done in Prince his house before there was a Paisley Park even yeah\nA sitting at a piano with a microphone and working out songs and that's the name of the new pest you must prince album piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three what a career he's had a since his death in two thousand sixteen the vaults have become a low yeah to the public will see\nUh what this producers because in the past we've seen\nSome uh some vaults or projects or the Jimmy Hendrix as state or the doors et cetera ... where there's been a ton of recordings coming out a posthumously\nThat is starting to happen now with prince's music as well we're going to evaluate a the the merits of this project but first let's play a track from it\nIt's a track called Mary don't you weep a great uh nineteenth century spirit has been in the gospel cannon for centuries as performed by prince from piano in a microphone Nineteen eighty three unsound opinions [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nFriends with a piano microphone in Nineteen eighty three\nCovering Mary don't you weep a I don't think he tops Aretha Franklin version on amazing grace but it is an extraordinary a version of that song Greg a neglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this out and piano when a microphone Nineteen eighty\nThree on Staten one point getting here prince talking about you got to flip that over now right cassette kids was an antiquated a technology oh never mind I'm you know\nI and saddened by what is certain\nTo be forty or fifty years of ... grave robbing of princes volts would he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely and you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really love the ... song cold coffee and cocaine\nName\nA prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring and they're like you know the street hustler the why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and cold coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great loss to prince album like say the blackout\nBe hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scuffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially until Nineteen Ninety four are their equivalent like that in in these balls I don't know there are revelations here\nI just don't know if I'll ever listen to it again [noise]\nYou know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a it was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why is this even coming out and the more or listen to it as sort of got pulled into the idea\nThat we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was prince um you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished records in his vaults there I haven't come out\nSo why this one you had made purple rain get you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary but we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtuous city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be\nSo unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting it wonder\nIs pretty bad I mean there's basically a a thirty minutes string of unbroken music here where he's just one piece into the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nUm\nGreat gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvention it going to be throwing it out of church there's no it'll just Saturday Night local scripture is there any more than Mary's no real person who get your lovers are going to come home Mary right Mary don't you weep you know he's a\nHe's talking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the end the profane\n... down\nYoung man up so I Love that aspect and I'm Glad you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine you know a Jamie stars just another way saying I'm ripping author James Brown here\nNo I'm not going to recommend this to everybody a but man if your prince man this is that this was man it from Avon is a man like yeah but if somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt and just found those Mary don't you will yeah I'm ... and gave us a whole out and but that\nYou know instead this is going to be you know he's going to be putting out records you no longer than he was alive [laughter] no doubt about it there's going to be hundreds of prince records before we're we're all guns I\nAnd worked very closely with Spike Lee's father who did the score from\nThat album when I was working at Arlen records\nOr girl that I once knew who often had\nAnd then go there all day to show the ... which one which day ... and\nThen I went on to management I kind of circles around this for a long time in different directions and find the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came from a recommendation to ... that was the first\nFilm I ever did on my own you know I approached it like this is what my artist one Jillian just before the wash and I'm going to figure out a way to go [noise]\n\n\nYou know\nYour job essentially didn't exist for a long time and it was one of those things that sort of evolved just music and movies built to sort of synergistic\nRelationship it used to be that orchestral scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a policing songs from the pop music Rome or whatever genre into the movie just sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack album so addicted to the swimmer the traveling swimmer that have the most beautiful American family theme\n\nYou know and ... I think my record collection had almost equally soundtrack final soundtracks visited bam you have always found that interesting and I can never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was his job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into movies were record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always one of the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work at ... in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think we're too involved too is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director you know shock value and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he said okay we're going here and all that\nWas my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work\n... [noise]\nChain [noise]\nMuch [laughter] [noise]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO series you worked on big little lies and sharp object\nWas that they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV male characters are the ones who are the messengers of the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about these me so you know she's listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her ... her precocious little\nIPod you know telling her dad you know which Elvis song he needs to play no no no dog you could do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventy stopping and then you know introducing Leon Bridges to her mom and yo yo you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls [noise]\nI don't want to come on\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n[noise]\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer than we are having to tone are a motive story through the like the\nTracks which is very unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer we're going to handle all these emotional beads\nThrough our you know through these characters that I mean so closely you know we really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative believe through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nWell there's also a character in sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her iPod [noise] she's a fellow patient in the hospital a with Camille shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with ...\nHours teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin as a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhat I loved about Camille was that she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she there with this young girl that you know kind of looks at her and has more kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really listen to music and the girls like job just to follow the law that she's\nShe's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she doesn't want Iran to girl and she goes but I can get out of here and that I Love that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking at some in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be an hair and teaching the power of music to escape your situations\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\nYou know really signed on to\nThan just some background than a restaurant or some ... some video if you actually important role in in so many large and if you're not familiar with it in that way and\nDon't have that relationship I'm hoping that Camille character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait I'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record and see what happens and you can fly off and it will totally change your mood I think that the importance of it\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though Susan you so did you ever have a conversation with the character and say why do you have such expensive tastes good licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they are notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music from or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV shows\nYou know when ... knew that Led Zeppelin with his fantasy to be able to use it I don't know if we ever thought this would really happen but he put it in my hand and said if I could find anything for Allison Camille this would be what it was\nAnd I started working on that way before we started shooting and we started but really early conversations and working with a wonderful woman over Warner chop all you know we just kept shaping the letters than the communication until it became really clear\nWe met at an ice rink where I was ... when you sit down and try and jump in Asia you you're right you don't have some more stuff to go for just showing up and so it really started with such a first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher\nAnd so those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm\nAnd that she said that we could have power because otherwise you wouldn't like her\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things in it which totally film didn't want it and it made her older so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed in I Want seventies music\nAnd then we just worked really really hard to get\nWhat we wanted to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of like Tania was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told\nAnd you know we mark ... was so gracious because he has turned down\nThe dire straits among Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out to spend four hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real and said I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can send a rash than I knew that he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet so I'm [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\n[noise] living room and then [noise]\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and\nThen he wrote the sweetest note and said thank you Susan checkups I would've never know\nThat was it and he was so happy to be part of that film that and I think it's really about communication artist's artist you know more quakes turn to do\nWhy it's important and why that music belongs there is a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. O. J. was just a baby than just stop point\nIt's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage of of visuals an artist and then also to to see that I was saying and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing Joplin is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see the ... three eight\nOvertures lie just blew\nHustle had a lot to do and they're not talking the pilots 'cause that guy's got one has long after another as you're not like she you know that I that that that same ... and you know you're kind of think that that gave a lot of new life to that time because the crowd went crazy over it\nWasn't one of those uh you know top twenty below you know greatest hits you know and he ...\nHe got a top forty there I mean every song he probably she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that too and you talked to and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for you so you're the\nMusic ... like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV besides your own projects what if you had to say to anybody\nGive me an example of how music and audio and video can work together to create something\nSort of a third thing that's the greater than some of the parts what's what's your best example of that\nBecause the Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate [laughter]\n[noise] I mean those are the things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight\nCowboy and my goodness I mean Harry Nelson you know when you have that especially midnight cowboy when you have that collaboration between composer and then\nAn artist like Harry I mean all of us are trying to keep making that\nNone of us have gotten there\n\nI Can't see them\nAll in the shadow\nThink about midnight cowboy and how that song track\nLand to\nMake that dark in deeper and more [noise]\nYeah that's amazing and you can't even look at the graduate without thinking about the timing and Garfunkel\nSoundtrack to that we're all trying to do that I mean we you know should I have anything that ever comes close to that kind of collaboration with a solo artist\nBeing able but also the industry was braver than I think people just took it you know music played a looser roll it was more\nYou know things weren't as managed as they are now\nYou know I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking the same that\nSome day I think you're inspiring a new generation they're all I Hope so I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming on trying to put in a great thank you all\nWraps up our interview with music supervisors Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what's your film and television show that you think uses music really well give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundreds\n[noise]\n\nBut he was for the rich [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter] [noise] as often as we like to take a trip to the desert island half a quarter and a desert island ...\nWe cannot live without Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music and the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on movies are but that's only because my wife is the editor of movies at your paper or she's up and bring them home and she had to twist my arm\nTo watch this film that she was excited about and I was skeptical Nico Nineteen eighty eight\nThis is the twenty Seventeen interesting collaboration between artist in Italy and Belgium\nA female director Susanna Nicole rally a shot in English starring a Danish actress train dry hole apparently a train was a a big star in her native or Scandinavia a began singing as a teenager\nThe director Susanna and train the actress a spent tons of time\nChanneling late era Nico now Nico famously what's the singer for the velvet underground on a few songs on the first album Andy Warhol shove tear down John Cale and reads throats or it resulted in moments of brilliance she\nHad a long solo career there are moments of greatness in that solo career but by Nineteen eighty eight when this film is almost entirely ... uh she was a heroin addict she", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
