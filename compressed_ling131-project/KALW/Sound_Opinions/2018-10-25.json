winning music supervisor\nThat means she's the person that picks the songs you hear in shows like a sharp objects and big little lies she's also been the music supervisor for a number of movies working with people like Spike Lee David all Russell\nOn and on she'll talk with us about how she decides what's the perfect song for every scene and how she got Led Zeppelin of all people to agree to their music being used\nThat's coming up later in the show Greg but first we've got some new music [noise]\nMet the man oh\nOn the you\nWho\nThat is a snippet of purple rain everybody knows that right oh yeah the great prince as you can tell very sparse a stripped down version or in its initial stages a purple rain\nThese are demo recordings are done in Prince his house before there was a Paisley Park even yeah\nA sitting at a piano with a microphone and working out songs and that's the name of the new ... prince album piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three what a career he's had a since his death in two thousand sixteen the vaults have become a although yeah to the public will see\nUh what this producers because in the past we've seen some uh some vaults or projects or the Jimmy Hendrix as state or the doors et cetera ... where there's been a ton of recordings coming out a Pashtun asleep\nOr that is starting to happen now with prince's music as well we're gonna valley way or the the merits of this project but first let's play a track from it\nIt's a track called Mary don't you weep a the great uh nineteenth century spirit who's been in the gospel cannon for centuries as performed by prince from piano in a microphone Nineteen eighty three unsound opinions [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\nFriends with a piano in a microphone in Nineteen eighty three covering Mary\nDon't you weep a I don't think he tops retail Franklin version on amazing grace but it is an extraordinary a version of that song Greg neglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this out and piano when a microphone Nineteen eighty three ... sat in\nOne point here prince talking about you got to flip that over our right cassette ... was an antiquated a technology I'll never mind I'm you know\nI Am saddened by what is certain\nTo be forty or fifty years of posthumous grave robbing of princes volts would he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely and you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really love the ... song cold coffee and cocaine\nYou know I'm In Maine\nA prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring or like you know the street hustler the why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and cold coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great last prints album like say the blackout\nThe hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scoffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially till Nineteen Ninety four are their equivalent like that in in these ball I don't know there are revelations here\nI just don't know if I'll ever listen to it again\n[noise] you know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a\nIt was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why is this even coming out and the more I listen to it as sort of got pulled into the idea\nThat we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was French I'm you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished records in his vaults there I haven't come out\nSo why this one you had made purple rain get you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary\nBut we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtual city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be so unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting it wonder\nIs pretty bad thing I mean there's basically a a a thirty minutes string of unbroken music you're where he's just getting on one\nEnd to the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nUm\nThat great gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvention it going to be that way yeah yeah it's it out of church is no big deal just Saturday Night local scripture is there any more than ... now a real person who yet you're lovers are going to come home ... married don't you weep you know he was\nTalking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the and the propane\n\nYoung man up so I Love that aspect and I and I'm Glad you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine\nYou know a Jamie stars just another way saying I'm ripping on James Brown here now I'm not going to recommend this to everybody a but man if your prince man\nThis is that this was manner from Avon is a man like yeah but if somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt and just found those Mary don't you we're\nUm and and give us a whole outlook that\nYou know instead this is going to be no he's going to be putting out records you no longer than he was no doubt about it there's gonna be hundreds of prince records before we're we're all God's oh\nAnd worked very closely with Spike Lee's father who\nDid the score for that album when I was working at Arlen records\nAre girls that I once knew who all of them had\nOh thank God but they're all day to show their low and the which one which the ...\nAnd then I went on to management I kind of circled around this for a long time in different directions and by the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came from a recommendation to ... for ... that was the first\nFilm I ever did on my own you know I ... just like this is what my artist once Julian doesn't for the Washington I'm going to figure out a way to go [noise]\n\n\nYou know\nYour job essentially didn't exist for a long time it was one of those things that sort of ... music and movies built to sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that are orchestral scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a policing songs from the pop music Rome where whatever genre into the movie to sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack albums I was a dictator to the swimmer the trauma swimmer that had the most beautiful American families theme\n\nYou know and Spartacus in I think my record collection had almost equally soundtrack final soundtrack visited bam you have always found that interesting and I can never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was a job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into movies were record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always one of the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work at ... in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think where it's evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director shock value and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he says okay we're going here and all that was my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work\n... [noise]\nChanged [noise]\nMuch [laughter]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO series you worked on big little lies and sharp objects\nWas that they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV milk characters are the ones who are the messengers or the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about these me so you know she's listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her her precocious little\nI pilot you know telling her dad you know which Elvis song he needs to play no no no dog you've got to do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventy stopping and then you know introducing Leon Bridges to her mom and yo yo you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls [noise]\nI don't want to\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer than we are having to tell our a motive story through the license tracks which is\nVery unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer we're going to handle all these emotional ...\nThrough our you know through these characters that I mean clearly you know we really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative believe through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nWell there's also a character and sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her iPod she's a fellow patient in the hospital a with Comey oldest shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with ...\nHours teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin as a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhat I loved about Camille with it she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she there with this young girl that you know kind of looks at her and says we're kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really listen to music and the girls like job just to follow the law that she's she's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she and her two girls and she goes but I can get out of here\nAnd that I Love that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking at some in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be an hair and teaching the power of music to escape your situation\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nKnow really signed on to\nThan just some background than a restaurant\nOr some pop after some video if you actually important role in\nIn so many large and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that Camille character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait\nI'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record into what happened and you can fly off and it will totally change your mood I think that's the importance of it\n\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though Susan you so did you ever have a conversation with the character and say why do you have such expensive taste good licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they're notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music for him or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV shows\nYou know when some mark news that Led Zeppelin with his fantasy to be able to use it I don't know if we ever thought this would really happen but he put it in my hands and said if I could find anything for Allison Camille this would be what it was\nAnd I started working on that way before we started shooting and we started but really early conversations and working with a wonderful woman over Warner chop all you know we just kept shaping the letters and the communication until it became really clear\nWe met at an ice rink where I was ... when you sit down and try and jump in Asia you you're right you don't have some more stuff that goes with the show and it doesn't really started with such a first picture as always for what's going to serve the pitcher\nAnd so those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm and that she said that we could have power because otherwise you wouldn't like her\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things and it was totally film didn't want it and it made her an older\nSo we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed in I Want seventies music and then we just worked really really hard to get what we wanted and to put things in there and you're always to serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of like Tania was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told\nAnd you know we mark ... was so gracious because he had turned down\nThe dire straits from Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out but for hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real instead I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can spend the rest and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet so I [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\n[noise] mystery shows [noise]\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and then he wrote\nThe sweetest note and said thank you Susan Jacobs I would've never know that was it and he was so happy to be part of that film and I think it's really about\nCommunication are just an artist you know more Craig's turned to do why it's important and why that music belongs there\nIs a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. O. J. was just a baby ban that point\nIt's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage of\nA visual artist and then also to to see that I was saying and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing Joplin is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see the ... three eight overtures lie just blew\nNational had a lot to do when you're not talking the pilots cars that guy's got one his calling after another as you're not like she you know but I that that that same ... the film and you know you're kind of think I bet that gave a lot of new life to that time because the crowd went crazy over crazy\nIt wasn't one of those uh you know top twenty below you know greatest hits you know and he's got\nHe's got a top forty there I mean every song he plays she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that too and you know that too and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for you so you're the\nMusic geek like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV besides your own projects what if you had to say to anybody\nGive me an example of how music and audio and video can work together to create something sort of a third thing that's the greater than the sum of the parts what's what's your best example of that\nBecause the Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] I mean those are the things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight cowboy my goodness I mean ...\nYou know when you have that especially midnight cowboy when you have that collaboration between composer and then\nAn artist by carry I mean all of us are trying to keep making that\nKnow\nOn channel\nI think about midnight cowboy and how\nLane to\nMake that dark and deeper and more [noise]\nYeah that's amazing and you can't even look at the graduate without thinking about the\nSoundtrack to them you know we're all trying to do that I mean we you know should I have anything that ever comes close to that kind of cooperation with a solo artist being able but also the industry was braver\nThan I think people just took the music played a looser roll it was more you know things weren't as managed as they are now\nYou know I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking the same\nSunday Morning and I think you're inspiring a new generation there shall I Hope so I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming on sound opinion I'm great thank you all\nWraps up our interview with music supervisor Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what's your film and television show that you think uses music really well give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your ants\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBut he was he was rich [noise]\n\n\n\nThat we've ... together [noise]\n\n\n\nAs often as far as we like to take a trip to the desert island pop a quarter and a desert island your box and\nPlay a track we cannot live without Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music and the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on movies about that because my wife is the editor of movies at your paper or she's often bringing something home and she had to twist my arm\nTo watch this film that she was excited about and I was skeptical Nico Nineteen eighty eight\nThis is a twenty Seventeen interesting collaboration between artist in Italy and Belgium\nA female director Susanna Nicole rally a shot in English starring a Danish actress train dry hole apparently a train was a big star in her native uh Scandinavia a began singing as a teenager\nOr the director Susanna and train the actress or spent tons of time\nChanneling late era Nico now Nico famously was the singer for the velvet underground on a few songs on the first album Andy Warhol shove tour down John Cale and reads throats or it resulted in moments of brilliance she\nHad a long solo career there are moments of greatness in that solo career but by Nineteen eighty eight when this film is almost entirely sat", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "25"}
