Hammond organ to record a vocal which just wasn't done right the jumped\nNo no because he wasn't done I'm and I and I also had you know certain sounds in my head because I I'd be listening to a lot of American records while I was most most string records and I don't want you to try and improve\nOr get get more more sort of adventurous sounds out of the studio them than we were basically getting and the other thing I was going in full was this closest sound honoring the drum kit and not to move to the ... closer to get ... from skin off and go into trouble or you know for moving ... closer than than two feet and\nEventually ended up with a written letters to giving me permission to be able to do that\nTell us about these backward tape loops which Rob you see a big part of tomorrow never knows and all out and how did you guys happened upon using this\nYou know we ... our own little ... and pull in particular I used to go go home and an expert among like in these little little crazy type loose on on is a\n... machine but they'd be back which things started when John actually got to ... the only he's reel to reel because you know read we didn't have to section those days and and the only way you could take attract hungry to listen to it was a ... I'm\nA which meant watching for up to the next stage and get to get it so Jonah he's reel to reel tape machine and been completely non technical took the type of of of a rough mix 'em and lifted up backwards on the machine and came back the next day and said there was something wrong with the mix\nAnd not realizing that you'd been playing it back to [laughter] ... so ... off after that we you know we we you know that that's how the tobacco which things started you know we used to listen to everything backwards that we we we recorded you know even as as just as a as a well not really a joke because ... and\nWe we we saw the Russian language was was actually English backwards when we got some Russian\nUh ... them and played it backwards to see if it was actually English when it was played back with the world [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get the impression from here there and everywhere your book yet but there was a stranger moment\nBin Laden in deciding that he had to sound as if he was singing\nUnderwater for yellow submarine and in fact he wanted you to record him singing underwater\nIn well what exactly I mean that was you know what I mean I'm running around the students were also turn on the air out you know there's all there's all the all the people that you know as a sign in the end of someone you knew John you can't do that I mean it'd be blowing singing singing into wool from bumping into knows what else\nThe liability so I so will the next best thing is just this out of desperation was to try and put them more ... in in a in a bottle of water and just it just seemed to the to the golf golf milk multiple but we have to protect the slim convince a microphone\nWhich I you know what to unfold evolves running through it a\nElectricity I don't know much about recording engineer and electricity and water don't mix right ...\nExactly yeah so I was thinking well what what can we put it in a ... you know produce the or the ... of his wallet and uh put put them watching that and in ... in the middle bustle so and that's what we did what I call them a dose inclined did not using it was just a dull yeah sort of sort of sound to Joan Joan\nI'm telling you that and if you if you had that use condoms today or I Am a man you'd be set for next year I'm your\nFear right he couldn't understand why he couldn't directly inject he's vocal but you could have vice guitar or get a guitar like lights are on ... and you know ... or ... ... ... and to do with Martin explained that you'd have to have an operation and other jak jak socket and plump to their needs met but that was on the show there's a joke you know he so he can run and stuff like that you know\nOne of the things to that I think you you sort of pioneered with this record revolver a Jeff was just simply where you place to the microphones inside ring goes bass drum and close might be the string section on a you know and Eleanor ... did you have any idea how these experiments were going to turn out before you tempted to\nBut they do all the other and everybody thinks string sound was was the sound that you know to discuss with pool and we went through this close around them because when I went in very close to the string players were those microphones which was a ... a double ... so there was a player is there\nA like they'd never be marked as close as about ... the some of the guys as we would find the ... desk who weren't as good as good appliances the guys in the front desk you know these to sort of saw ditches away from the marks but but you know I always you can hear what was going on I have to keep going downstairs\nAnd I'm just getting them to move back you know maybe even more closely to an end in the enjoyed march and not to tell them to stop doing it on the root cause we're off to particular sound [noise]", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "14"}
