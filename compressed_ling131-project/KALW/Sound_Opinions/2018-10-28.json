trick or treaters are ringing the bell or you're having your Halloween party or just generally want to get ... out in the spirit of the season right\nIt is by requests from our listeners Jim I think are most popular short second most popular maybe behind the answers and Christmas special but people love scary songs and there are a ton of them were going to get to a bunch more today you get to go first or a gym I've got a perfect lead us down for us it's from the band the cure\nFrom the u._k. debut album Nineteen Seventy nine three imaginary boys and it is a song that I think typically buys this whole notion of the theater of imagination you talk about this a lot of movies where a guy like Alfred Hitchcock was terrific building suspense and building anticipation\nYou wouldn't show you what is happening but what might happen and planting the seeds of doubt in the viewer's mind about what is about to happen to these characters\nAnd I think this cure song subway song does that perfectly basically only eight lines averse I great I'm In a baseline in this song\nThese little terse finger snaps about midway through and then a surprise ending I'm not going to give away completely but just be a notice that something terrible is going to happen\nTo this person that is depicted coming home late at night on a subway train we've all been there we've all heard the footsteps in the back of us wondering is that somebody following me am I the only person in here or am I being stalked by someone\nSo the anticipation is is really nicely played out in the song it is a horrific Halloween saw the cures subway song on sound opinions [noise]\n\n\n[noise] from [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nMidnight\nAnd ... on the way home she tries not to room ... she's not a no permanent\nGruesome steps photo behind Bush and um or\nAround [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nUm [noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWow\nI jump out of my seat when I was wrong it will be played in the background and I'm just like al jump out of my chair when I hear it is scary but I tell you what scarier as Robert Smith your whole the whole outfit the make up the whole thing yeah this has got it like the pre makeup Robert Smith but his head was definitely in a dark place when he wrote subway song that's the cure from Nineteen Seventy nine\nOr ... what have you got for a great Halloween sock well Greg\nYour reserve scary rock songs is seemingly a boundless but you know we've done the show a bunch of times and I wanted to not be so obvious that I wanted to kind of take some left turns today so I turned to some of our listeners for some inspiration some I chose myself\nSome came in by email people were working with guns all about the show they just were given a great suggestions\nKevin in ... park out here in Illinois he said\nOne of my favorite songs spooky or not is ghost town by the specials from the ghoulish bones to the high pitch whales from the scary image painted the empty streets and closed down clubs to Stengel cover artwork skeletons playing the piano he\nLoves the creepy by above this all he does know in in a joking better that even scarier was that no doubt once covered well we're going to the original version by the special one ghost town came out in Nineteen eighty one it was talking about\nShuttered streets unemployment urban unrest on the streets of London it was a heavy time and there were riots that erupted just as this song was coming out and making to the top of the chart\nAnd I think that's the scary thing about this song a city losing it so a city in an uproar here it is by the special ghost town on sound [noise]\n\n\n[noise] are being killed or\nAnything [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost town by the specials on sound opinions one of our scary expertise is Halloween which got your next what he got to show a good one gym one of the scariest aspects of this song is the fact that the singer Scott\nWalker once used to be in a group called the Walker brother seeing music was completely unlike when I'm about to play\nThe Walker brothers had a huge hit in the sixties called the sunny kind of shy anymore you can YouTube and find out what that is all about and played that song and then play this next one is about to lay on you in the Gulf that's the same guy Scott Walker using that flush baritone crew in his voice in a more sinister fashion\nOn this song it's from his two thousand six something called the drift\nAnd in this song he starts I was kind of this post nine eleven scenario and then it morphs into this meditation or Elvis Presley in the womb\nOf his mother lying next to his dad twin Jesse people don't realize this but maybe that Elvis Presley did actually have a twin was stillborn\nAnd he's imagining this conversation it's actually at one way conversation Elvis talking to this this dead person lying next to him in the world\n\nWelcome back to ... with Jimmy regardless and this is our annual Halloween and special we've been hearing from some of our listeners about some of their scariest songs of all the time the gym and I are going back and forth with some of our selection and uh right now is Jim stern Greg I'm going to throw in other\nAnd one was so good maybe go instantly told how come I never thought of it before Shelby Peterson from Chicago said hard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cast to it and when she gets out near the end that alert yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nEunice waymen need it smells real name\nIs singing a song by ... Brecht and Curt Vile from three pending opera if I look at it as just the two that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part up are coming to rescue her\nThe black chip on the horizon and that these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the decks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe way Nina Simone plays it now she was a civil rights activists\nShe changes a very few words and does it skillfully\nIt's suddenly a southern hotel but she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and\nThe black ship suddenly becomes something else if it's going to become justice when societies equalized you're gonna get yours and you know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed that that's what's\nCreepy about it as a powerful tune\nA scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone unsound opinions [noise]\nYou can watch these from spreading the loss while you're gone [noise]\nMaybe once you get to me and it makes you feel well\nBut you'll never guess into [noise]\nNo [noise] is that ... you know\nThen one night they as a scream in the night and you wonder what\nBeen [noise] and you see me granny imams\nWhat she got to clean out terrier and\n[noise]\nWith the no on it smack\nDead we'll be common\n\nYou gentleman can\nFrom let's get bad what's wrong with you on TV yeah you're talking to me it depends on how can they shipped but I'm happy\nTo be nice [noise]\nNobody's going to sleep you\nKnow [noise]\n[noise] but\nThen one night the bass bring in the heat and you see who's been kicking\nAround [noise] and you see me\nOut the window [noise]\nWhat you've got to stand\n\nSort of [noise]\n[noise]\nOh ... oh\nPirate Jenny from Nina Simone from Jim do you regard as one of his great Halloween songs of all time I loved that choice Gemini ties in a really nicely with what I'm going to play next that sort of macro view of the world the sense of evil in the world looked like a fiasco addressed that on his song puts you on game from his two thousand seven out of the cool\nIt was a concept album about this title character and the choices he has to make in this world fraught with evil I mean look at it was coming up a really hard time and it's like when he made this album his father and a good friend had just died his longtime manager just gone to prison so he's investigating this topic of\nYou know temptation evil sinister forces at work in the world\nThe narrator in this song is a really creepy character the guy runs this place and we're talking about from the White House to the crack house and you have those those violins kind of escalating in the background the crack of gunshots you've got this ominous ... let me put you on game\nThe game is that is hostile to you know the ... game the con game the gangster game\nAnd the song just keeps escalating intensity until the very end when ... almost revealed his identity or the identity of the narrator in this song he\nDoesn't really tell you who it is because it's on cuts off just in time but you can get I mean this is sympathy for the devil this is the Rolling Stones sudden you know everywhere there's some mayhem happening I'm the guy at the heart of it all to pay fiasco put you on game unsound opinion [noise]\nSome you know that I'm running this place and not become this must be run visit then it's become this way instead of ... with is the reason I have become\nMuch dominant made them all and then they have become among [noise] I've been to one woman from in the poll with the numbers dot in the heart of the some of them are given the mole plumbing is with us from then on this road rules from\nFootsteps I'm the one that they know the one that is when\nMarket and the whole homeland and crack houses in the long\nTo do to me is that the news the pages and everything just in the chamber\nOf things none of the thing to change your thinking there's only\nOne that is most ancient his things because every single language on the plane\nThem and dying and machine the whole ... committed the murder diversity regime the tough guy and the ... the um [noise]\nI Am the London it's gas and electricity ... and it is to read the gunshots and the class and Jane passion you\nKnow ... and I told the main\nI'm Glad that he's going to be

pragmatic than it may\nYou should have been a welfare even probably\nThink you can watch all the ... the ... the British are filled with friendships or something like that 'cause I think one\nThe veterans didn't mislead the number one to prevent\nFrom the role of the phones\nThese fools among fuels to make them\nOut of some mixed them from the table with all the young people have to do that\nAnother fine Halloween choice put you on game by loop a fiasco nice when Greg I uh am ever got nobody to blame except myself for this one and you make Scott initially at this choice but I'm going with ten cc's I'm not in love\nWatch creepy about it for one thing the production Kevin godly and allow cream the driving forces in this early seventies English rock band are now much better known as an award winning video production team back then\nThey were just as in ... in the recording studio guess initially started out as a falling out of love song with a bossa nova beat nothing too extraordinary they decided to take out the drums and to build\nA wall of rhythm from voices the former members of the band each one and then over dubbed at an ... an over dumped it until they were two hundred and fifty six voices singing the same note which gives this kind of robbing sensation it seems pretty at first but it gets creepy your as the song goes on\nThen they really dropped the bomb with this apparently they turned to the studios receptionist and had her give that spoken word interest in the middle\nOf the big question cry big but it's just crazy he said he's not in love I don't think you're going to be breathing much longer either it's kind of in the spirit of that song Timothy that you'd be in a couple of years ago which was actually about cannibalism make little pop sort of a kind of what that's what ten she sees are not in love is for me here it is our down to ...
