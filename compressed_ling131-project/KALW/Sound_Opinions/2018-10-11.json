[noise]\n\nFrom WB easy Chicago NPR actually this is sound opinions I'm Jim\n... caught this week or justice Wayne Kramer musician elite guitars for the legendary Detroit rock band MC five it was just the lows of addiction in prison and the highs are performing live\nMusicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do\nIt from hip hop artist NO NAME and pay tribute to lake Chicago blues legend Otis Rush that's all coming up unsound opinions\nFound opinions is supported by design in their company Chicago craft or if that works in the new ways to brew and AIDS fear more at ... dot com you don't need to be the only theory drank we just want to be the ... he drank [laughter]\nYou're listening to sound opinions and later on we'll talk with musician Wayne Kramer legendary guitarist for the Detroit banned the MC five currently on tour celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of that bans signature debut kick out the jams\nWill talk to weigh in about his new memoir is struggles with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turn his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush [laughter]\n\nThat his oldest rush with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eighty four Jim not as well known and some of the great Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon even touting guy Howlin' Wolf [noise]\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them are really important a figure in Chicago blue scene beginning in the fifties in fact if you'd only recorded those sites that he did with Kobe records here in the fifties for over a two year period\nOf fifty six fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars he had a long career after that suffered a stroke and the two thousand and three that just centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen Years of his life but his legacy\nIs huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kind of merger\nThat was so hip Twenty years later\nOr or or a decade later we started with people like Hendricks oldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bar scene in Chicago and you can hear it in his guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nAnd the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that our oldest rush used the horn section instead of a harmonica player in his bands\nBut there was also an intensity to the sound that old is a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think it was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there was a protest music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gone said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nA you know he'd always be smiling and those album covers yeah if you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and he was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't do anything but worry that's about\nI mean this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck\nYou know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every note he played his guitar player was extraordinary but he was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf this as a performer was not only could he play the guitar but man that guy could sing as well here's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kid in his early twenties and listen to the intensity beat the very adult nature of the anguish in this man's voice\nDouble trouble from Otis Rush unsound opinions\n\n\n\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room to twenty five the first proper album by an artist who goes by NO NAME she does have a name when Warner grew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago\nOr mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene are collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation Greg Mick Jenkins chance the rapper Donny Trump at the social experiment\nMeal of woods or twenty sixteen got a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone now comes a photo album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another dealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song\nCalled NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from room twenty five on sound opinion [noise]\n\nI mean for the ... and ... and you see that let me turn I felt the anthem and some of the three\nAnd a mining and get it\nFrom a\nNovel right the\nPaint mystery\nAnd he didn't and going in the summer camp there\n[noise]\nOn the Internet at that\nLet us know name with a track called NO NAME from her new record room twenty five gym a lot of discussion about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what he called herself known as the question she gets asked\nA lot of interviews and you know I think she's trying to addressing that in this record um the whole idea of identity what does it mean uh I think it's the subtext of almost every track on this record is that society\nTries to a race African American people tried to make them invisible women's I've been especially yes\nAgnew was the vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new left says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that's that's making some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar of the vice president states what was it was a ...\nBeing fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they held against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before a court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretapped case led to the downfall of Richard\nNixon I basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo me it was interesting when you talk very openly in the book you could've openly admitting hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did the transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work hard as something that I taught mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much but the radicalization was that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know at my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act in a democracy is participatory it's not just a word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it\nAnd I protested with everything that I had and I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifties sexual morality\nMarijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and ah I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n\n[noise]\nRight in the middle of the sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only against the war the number of bands that were invited to play you were the only man that actually did play\nUh this that the student movement that was occurring in protest it what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day in sixty eight to because of the riots started to flow downhill pretty much as soon as you've got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there's a good vibe it was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson trace it goes through the crowd\nKnocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting fist fights with kids a roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and uh you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the ban once we finished our sat and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on they focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with the ... swinging batons and and you had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw happening on the nightly news you know they've never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporters like that and\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nIt plain that after the MC five such intensity blaze so bright for a short period of time\nYou go into the recording of the check it out and Penn it's a real super intense studio experience and you seem to have mixed feelings about that album still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach\nWhat we had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time to learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff ... and check out the germs was recorded lives\nSo on a back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our\nApproach in order to be better musicians to\n[noise]\nHave mixed feelings but [noise] um I I Know each albums intimately I Know\nWhat their strengths and what their weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism that we were so undisciplined\nIn so irresponsible musically irresponsible idiosyncratic that that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on that the temples war solid\nSinging melodies were on pitch and and the lyrics were were very ... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great ... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your quite excellent solo career you know will always say the records are great but it's live\nIt's allowed what happens live I mean that's where I think is some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand as I understand what you guys took from jazz and and what you as a as a as a musician and a person I've taken from jazz is that spontaneity\nUnique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\nYeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do where everything works beautifully that Europe human beings doing\nA most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously and it actually never get any better than that there's a lot and I've I've had my share of of great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand and\nAnd everybody is just playing at the at the peak of their ability and the crowd is right there with you and\nThen the lights are writer and everyone looks good and we sound good\nTo find his way you\nKnow he's become obviously you're getting used to be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it he had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the abandoned and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances with I mean he's one of the great front men of all time um\nUh so yeah of course if or when Danny Fields or\nDoes or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more than likely MC five which are he just seemed like\nThe [noise]\nYou know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them\nSunrise and we all smoked with same passion we always saying bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nDo you think about the characters you know coming through that again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper at a time but he wouldn't name just a little bit later I guess a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all these characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we've all been together with all known each other\nGoing back to the record hop days where we're all\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and\nAnd uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between all the uh Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time in Detroit was\nDriving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible and\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOne of the\nUm hottest things I found all you have a good buddy whose name is Ted [noise] she\n[laughter] and I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place under the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah\nYou know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of are and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo uh to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that through his uh his hunting an outdoorsman hobby that there was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I we remain friends or I could call them up today and we can have a pleasant Congress\nReal substantive political young and Iran I I'm open to it I Would yeah I'd like to fish because I Know he does a lot of good in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people\nAnd I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I\nTo one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped ... you know\nHe's got this this pillow in the back of his trial of us but I ... it\nJust struck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there\n[noise]\n\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences and that most turbulent times\nOf the sixties we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne\nThat still the case today I mean you play in a lot of different sizes you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you ... you know um it does it still have that power you believe in yeah\nSure does our our ... will always have the power to make a connection between people\nTo to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music\nIf I tell the truth about how I feel about something chances are there's somebody else out there that felt the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case now out here you know somebody else's fields where because ultimately\nArt confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together ...\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] I'm\nWhen the MC five fell apart and then you go down your passive of drug abuse crimes wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there between you and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob Steiner [noise]\nYou you you say like ... I mean you deal with each of their passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the breakup of the band nothing was ever resolved or we never got to know each other as grown ups and it is just left as an open wound a scar a and\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to to ah when people leave before their time even if even if it is a natural herbs\nWell you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em but you know we never got its we never got a chance to to be friends and it kind of review what we went through together I think we probably none of us\nReally survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to\nTo walk through the fire and and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say that friendships and the camaraderie and the undermining of all that and\nSee it one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard [laughter]\nMhm [noise]\n... van ... [noise] boom [noise] may do\nTell us about a ... you have this second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based on on the west coast um what is what does that world like how did you get into it\nWell I knew I knew the day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again [laughter]\nYeah yeah there was a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticize it but it's flaming house sleeping on the floor night after night yeah it's it's hard work\nAnd and uh you know I I thought I could\nDo some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh I'm In movies and thought I could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this\nBut when I finally moved to LA and started to pursue it seriously argues got a few jobs and then I discovered I Need to go back to school so I started taking a scoring classes at UCLA\nAnd the union has some good orchestrating classes running at the time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11"}
