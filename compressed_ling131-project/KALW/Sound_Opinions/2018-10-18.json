week we're going to share some of our favorite music the flying under the radar\nThey can\nUse\nPlus we remember audio engineer Jeff camera worked with the Beatles I'm revolver and sergeant peppers

opinions and later in the show Jim we're going to pay tribute to the late Jeff am record a name that may not be a household name uh but uh certainly a legendary a audio engineer\nEspecially for his work with the Beatles classics like revolver sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band and he wrote among other class for it [noise]\n\nBut now it's time for another round of buried treasures Gregg is one of my favorite shows right indeed indeed what's buried treasure it this was a recording the we define as something that's probably under the mainstream radar you probably haven't heard of it\nOr a week collect bees we try to do the show every once in a while and turn you want to great music that deserves a wider audience Greg you get to go first job I'm going to start\nOff with a an exploration of garage rock one of our favorite genres ever since the sixties right every band that wanted to be you know we just talked about the Beatles while there was a lot of bands cropping up all over America that want it to be the Beatles play music in garages are in that tradition has carried on a long and glorious history in Chicago\nOr the last decade we've ... we've had a a ton of these really great garage rock combo in other words these are veterans from that seem that are forming this band eaters\nAre two things that make either as stand out from the pack one is the songwriting bone Hansen in particular he is writing a\nDeeper more introspective ally lyrical than you would expect from the typical garage rock band\nThe a a suicide an older brother ah has really informed a number of the lyrics on this I mean it's impossible to miss a bad vibe that melancholy tragic by that that courses through a number of these suction but it's not a downer at all this is a great band\nAnd I think the or the other distinctive feature of this band is the um a keyboard smearing McCain uh she plays one of those ... is\nThere a mirror yeah you're a reverse there for you to play with my band I don't know why and what I like about it is\nA Easter is does not use the uh the far fees as just sort of a little accent that its own over driven now lead instrument in this band and some of the heavier rock or is it really blast into the forefront\nThe sugar I'm going to play though is is more on the contemplative side it's just got a haunting melody two at a ... you hear the the bans gift\nFor a hawks are as well as that sort of the underlying tone of melancholy it's something from the band Peters unsound opinion\n\n\nThat is either it's with a song called something would have my buried treasures\nI'm loving to Greg does what ... supposed to do you just turn me on to them I Would say that they are more of the late era a garage where it's not just tear it up fake are and be a ... right I mean there's a lot of psychedelic mushrooms me up the psychedelic feeds\nI'm going to go all the way to New Zealand for my first buried treasure a band called the bats\nUm you know I my favorite bad for me dealing since why do the Concorde moved\nThis is a wonderful I'm really a energetic pop punk band\nWith a sort of in the uh you know shiny a psychedelic almost at times by think of the great Courtney Barnett renting the chills or the cleaning or other great kiwi bans ripe um and I don't make that Courtney Barnett comparison lightly\nThe leader of this group Elizabeth stokes is really smart or almost not ballistic songwriter uh sometimes I think I'm doing fine I think I'm pretty smart\nThan the walls become then somebody gets in I'm defenseless I Love that line from a song called future me hates me and I love that whole concept\nOf you as as as someone a young person trying to find your way in the world and you're looking ahead and thinking someday maybe I'll get it together and that person's gonna hate the person I Am now wow\nThat is a lot to pack into\nA this explosive guitar driven you know for an ethically drummed a punk song I just I just love it the bats from New Zealand future meat hates me [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat is the bats with the title track from their new album just came out in August future me eight to ... car park record that is a great title or if you're already a story of my life\nSophistication of relative sophistication of what the answers were doing the same thing with the best that those counterpoint harmonies really got me yeah I kind of a cut above\nOn this record up the next thing I Want to go to is our girl from the u._k. bright and to be specific a coed trio led by a woman named Sophie Nathan she's also a member of a band called big moon but our girl her other band sounds nothing like the big moon is kind of more of\nA down beach and more ah atmosphere or a girl is a is a trio in which a Nathan's guitar is right up front a lover sort of under state of very conversational the vocal style but she's got a real feel for hooks as a guitar player not only hooks\nBut also the ability to crank it up you know you get\nFrom these kind of eerie mood pieces it that just sort of explode you know when you least expect it so that dynamic plays itself out this is a really really good a debut album is called strangers today and here's a track from it it's called in my head from our girl unsound opinion [noise]\nHuge production in in the case of the new album that uh is so compelling to me is uh unusual and unusual for the scene that that came out of to me it's a this record is symbolic of advantage\nAt the edge of something that could just break up tomorrow and are just starting to just throw every idea\nOr maybe they could become a Twenty one pilot either way higher if you've got to pick a of an album that we really need to hear your call\nFind us on Facebook or Twitter after

Hammond organ to record a vocal which just wasn't done right the jumped\nNo no of course it wasn't done and I know I also had you know certain sounds in my head because I I'd be listening to a lot of American records while I was most most string records and I don't want you to try and improve\nOr get get more more sort of adventurous sounds out of the studio the ... the we were basically getting and the other thing I was going in full was his closest sound honoring drum kit and not to move the ... closer to get ... from skin off and go into trouble or you know for moving ... closer than than two feet and\nEventually ended up with a written letters to giving me permission to be able to do that\nTell us about these backward tape loops which were obviously a big part of tomorrow never knows and the whole album how did you guys happened upon using this\nYou know we went to our own little ... and pull in particular I used to go go home and an expert in like in these little little crazy type loose on on his\n... machine but they'd be back which things started when John actually on the ... the on his reel to reel because you know read we didn't have ... and and the only way you could take attract how to listen to it was a play by wacko I'm\nA which meant watching for an up till the next stage and get together so Jonah he's reel to reel tape machine and been completely known technical took the type of of of a rough mix\n'em and like stood up backwards on the machine and came back the next day and said there was something wrong with the mix\nAnd not realizing that you've been playing it back to [laughter] ... ... off after that we you know we you know that that's how the backwoods things started you know we used to listen to everything backwards that we we we recorded you know even as as just as it as well not really a joke because ... and\nWe we we saw the Russian language was was actually English backwards and we do some Russian\nUh spoken word and played it backwards to see if it was actually English when it was played back was also [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get the impression from here there and everywhere your book yet but there was a stranger moments been Lehman deciding that he had to sound as if\nHe was singing underwater for yellow submarine and in fact he wanted you to record him singing underwater\nIn well what exactly I mean that was you know what I mean I'm running around the studio false will turn on the air out you know there's all there's all the all the people that you know as a sign in the end of someone you to join you can't do that I mean it'd be blowing singing singing into ... knows what else\nThe so I so will the next best thing is just this out of desperation was to try and put a more profound in in in a in a bottle of water and growing up just ... to the to the Gulf Gulf milk both will but we have to protect the slim convince the microphone\nWhich had you know two hundred and full developed running through it a\nElectricity I don't know much about recording engineer and electricity and water don't mix right ...\nExactly yeah so I was thinking well what what can we put in a ... you know produce through the uh the ... of his wallet and ... the market now and in San ... in the middle of possible so on and that's what we did when I called a dose declined it up using it it was just a dull yeah sort of sort of sound to Joan Joan\nYour gender you if you had that use condoms today or I Am a man you'd be set for next year I'm your\nFear right he couldn't understand why you couldn't directly inject he's vocal but you could have vice guitar or get a guitar like lights are on ... and you know ... or ... ... ... and explain to your doctor of an operation another ... to their needs met but that was on the shutters a joke you know he so he can run up stuff like that you know\nOne of the things that I think you you sort of pioneered with this record revolver a Jeff was just simply where you place to the microphones inside ring goes bass drum and close to my you know the the string section on an al ... did you have any idea how these experiments were going to turn out before you tempted them\nBut they do all the other and everybody thinks string sound was was a sound that you know to discuss with pool and we want to disclose shining because when I went in very close onto the string plans with those microphones which was a ... a double ... so there was a player is there\nA but they'd never be marked as close as opposed to some of the guys as we would find the bank to ask who weren't as good as good a player does the guys in the front desk you know used to sort of saw ditches away from the ... but but you know I Wish you could hear what was going on I just keep going downstairs\nAnd I'm just getting them to move back you know maybe you're more close to an end the ... not to tell them to stop doing it in the ... because we were off to particular sound [noise]",
