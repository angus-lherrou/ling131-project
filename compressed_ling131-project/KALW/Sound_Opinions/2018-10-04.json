hip hop which into an art form let's rife with them we have a machine gun Kelly and you're having a few of them right now of course we had ... and Drake it's been there from the beginning of goes back\nTo trading the dozens right I'm going to insult your ... your mother so lessons sits around the house or at all that nonsense\nExactly and hip hop around with it or they took that a\nA tradition from the school yards into into music and and and the trading of insults a was a core element\nIn how an emcee would get discovered in the early days you know you would have these battle wraps between ... and the guy who got in the best this is not as often anointed the winter and was the guy with the career in his in his future\nSo this idea of disrespecting someone a ideally with humor I think that's how it works best a ... it's not confined to hip hop weren't going to go right back to the beginning in fact I think this is one of popular music first and most famous\nDistracts Nineteen sixty two Joe text gets into it with James Brown Joe tax was a and R B singer a really good one who was not surprisingly are born and raised in Texas has real name was Joseph Arrington\nAnd hand James Brown got into it and it lasted for years\nUh they were both on the same labeled Detroit's Anna Records for a period in the mid fifties apparently brown recorded a tune that tax at first popularized brown had more success with it changed it around some then brown said if you got a problem with that I challenge you do what do you know a musical dual [noise]\nAnd then eh joke tax divorced or his first wife who wound up with James Brown and brown rather chi chi le sends tax a letter and says when the relationships ended when the musical collaboration with that woman and did a you can ever back

they went out dish out their insults you know a first song James I'm not really you between\nYou and me brother but the whole world is going to hear about it now and go and I got to hit out of it as well you know I Want to go to an artist to ah basically made a career out of dissing people in in music but very as you said humor is a big part of this\nAnd the humor in in mo Jo Nixon's a music has always been a key on but the cycle Billy artist mo Jo next and he was with a a an are another ... do well in the eighties\nThe reason I even knew about them is because they would always come up with a song that was just somebody that was popular on the church there was a song about Debbie gifts in and ask nearly an\nMTV BJ Martha Quinn he has his solo debut mo Jo Nixon I he got rid of scared him and get ... hurting the ways mo Jo Nixon for this Nineteen Ninety ... oldest I think this is the apex of his career of distracts\nUh I think we can all agree I think before Big Lebowski got to it before uh\nBefore the dude proclaimed the eagles a pox upon humanity I think a lot of us were in the same pocket a and mo Jo ah understood that vibe in Nineteen Ninety ... said simply Don Headley must die a and a lot of us were kind of not and you know it's got a point\nWell ... and ... the eagles broke the hundred dollar ticket arc then they broke the two hundred dollar ticket mark you know eventually they broke like five hundred dollar concert tickets\nWell in addition to uh to making music I mean obviously they had a ton of hits and I'm probably insulting a ton of people by just saying that you know the eagles didn't exactly have a huge cache\nIn in a sort of the indie scene and and the whole idea that they were kind of smog about it too\nIt did not enamored them to to people like ... and uh the lines and the song don't ... don't let them get back together this is the whole idea about the eagles were now ... there was a parting of the ways don't want to get back together with Glenn fry Don handling much die\nAt the end of the song you know he gets in a shot it stinks too and everybody's going yes they have for that so they had the effect that\nAnd just in the same song mo Jo Nixon with\nJohn ... much die from Nineteen Ninety something\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nOn Wednesdays your call will expand for special to our programs focused on key races and critical issues as well let's underline challenges to our democracy including apathy voter suppression and the power of money in elections and on Tuesday November sex so\nIn depth coverage of the ... Eighteen midterms here on Ninety One point seven K. A. L. W. [noise]\n\nWasn't back down opinions on Jim be regardless he's Greg caught I Would never disrespect camp\nWere sharing some of our favorite distracts this week what does that mean a a songs that are evidence of an ongoing long lasting feud between musicians who are uh uh trading insults in song as we said in the last segment Greg hip hop has been rife\nWith distracts from the beginning uh you know in recent months we've we've seen machine gun Kelly go back at it with them and and back and forth right\nUh but I think what's interesting about the one I'm going to highlight is how long it's been going on Nikki ... makes her debut in a circle of two thousand ten and she's got her promo photo that little Kim dislikes because Nikki ... trying to look like little kitten\nAnd that starts what by my account is I think it's six or seven\nNicki Minaj dissing little Kim track in the years to come and then little Kim doing a whole concept mix tape dissing Mickey ... and they're still going at it today in two thousand a team\nOr the track the kind of starts it off after Mickey's are\nAngry that Kim a is mad about this picture is a song called Romans revenge and Nicki Minaj has an alter ego Romans landscape and she recruits as a partner on this district a master of the former also has an alter ego eminent\nWraps as slim shady and it all starts with what I think is a crap work rip off\n[noise]\n\n... produced this and this was really one of the productions and put him on the map and to me that sounds like the mode that introduced share a room dummy\nAlthough he said he was going for like an old time the videogame sound anyway this this track is insane\nI'm even you know our editors are going to have to edit a bit where a Nikki is directly taking on little can uh you know she's mad 'cause you took the spot you know you're missing Nicki Minaj ripped off her shtick a anyway here we go Romans revenge by Nicki Minaj on south than\nLanding\nBy these bombs and I just thought I'd have to get my money manager doesn't look like in the\nLast month\nAt the end of it ain't got no managed and I can't\nReally do you play them back in the same way\nThan\n\nJust driving\nRomans revenge ... talking through one of several alternative she had three years now she is in the same she's in the little Kim role now\nUh with that party be taking her I'm In this disputing it it it's like the Hatfield McCoys supposedly lasted for centuries right that's what these dishes sometimes go on for\nGym next I Want to go to oh let's see great a a band that was formed by Kathleen Hanna in the late nineties after a bikini kill\nA broke up um so this is the genesis of a punk rock few the began between her\nAnd a guy by the name of fat Mike who was leading this punk rock band no effects yeah I'm In in the nineties so fed Mike has written a number of songs that could charitable Eby called massage ... Kathleen Hanna backstage at a show once called outfit for for being\nA massages pig basically saying you're writing all these songs putting down women\nOh feminist I get it done with being on the same bill is you are\nHe got kicked off wrote a song about Hanna a calls kill offshore\n[laughter]\n\nChanged the world by hating men kind of missing the point completely uh about it a little bit of aesthetic\nChampion Hannah comes back in Ninety nine on the let's see gray debut album and the first song deceptive Khan is basically is read against ... Mike nicely described by the fact it's Dan simple as heck you don't even have to listen to the worst do enjoy it but man she gets in some shots\nOr you're just a parrot and you're screaming and shouting you you bought a new van the first year of your bad this is the ultimate indie rock this right\nYour bet your band is showing punk rock you brought a brand new ban I mean you ran by two hundred thousand ... band in the in the ... with the VCR for the kid exactly and then she names or a a new effects on just to make sure that message is\nVery clear a no effects on ... your lyrics are dumb like a well known him for a walk on a walk all over you\nKathleen Hanna of with the grey giving it right back the fat Mike I'm no affects ah here's a song with the great ... on some\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou later [noise] [noise] you later [noise]\nSee you later that is ... ... on sound opinions Jim what is your next distract\nI'm going to the alternative Eric Greg uh Nineteen Ninety four pavement put out crooked rain crooked rain\nThe heyday of modern rock radio\nOr is called Rangel yeah now it's never easy to say what Steven Malcolm X was talking about even got that pinch on approach to a post modern ah cut and paste lyric writing\nWhat these words jumped out out on tour with the smashing pumpkins nature kids they don't have no function I don't understand what they mean and I could really give a blank [laughter] oh boy that gets ... now now are you happen to agree with him you know I mean Billy ...\nAll those I'm just a rat in a cage blah blah blah his lyrics were the worst\nBut I don't know about the nature kid thing because I Would never called the pumpkins hippies\nYou know they were John Hughes suburban kids held a grudge about everybody who was cooler than them with everybody especially believes what I'm Talking about is you know we also takes a shot at stone temple pilots the elegant bachelors there foxy to me or they boxy you basically saying like these alternative pose are good will be poison\nKids we have to put this in context you know there there was\nThe period in Ninety four one suddenly this underground music that was for Seventy five people you know rotten dingy club is going to a hundred thousand people a at festivals and getting radio play and owning MTV and there were those who held onto the values that underground\nThere were those who are conflicted like Nevada and there were those who were eager to sell out\nI mean from the I covered the pumpkins from the beginning so did you ... to me there was no difference between men and journey or cans is\nYou know they wanted to be rock stars and the worst wet anyway they were vindictive Billy Oregon ordered pavement kicked off\nKing and walk as the kids say what is the problem is you see it with toxic masculinity in popular music\nWhat the answer is always the patriarchy let's start the problem is that\nIt's limiting men to to insist that one gender is one way one gender is the other way in music I mean\nWe all knew who were in bands in high school you guys know who have the drive and the ambition and that certain type of charisma that find success\nSome of that is I think gender based but they don't have to be the type of boy who\nIs limited in the way I'm that he sees the world to not feeling emotions to dominating his partners to being the alpha\nBoys who play guitar can also like sparkles and we saw that in the seventies um but we don't really have a resurgence yet a of a celebration of\nA less domineering masculinity\nAlright so and then make inspiring uplifting motivating a that offers a wide range of possibilities for any young man I think I got so we'll give you these students that were going to recommend as potential and then we'll check back with you know we can see if if they worked at the end\nWe will just put it on repeat and see what All right I and I also want your daughters to like him as well as your son I think that that's a great goal okay because you're talking about young young people hear your son three years old your daughter's not much older you know you've got to be able to hear the song and next thing you know you remember it\nBecause you just can't get that risk for that that lyric out of your head for that reason I chose uh MGM cheese song [noise]\n\n\nWas a hit from there to does need to do all of them a couple of guys from a Wesleyan University of Connecticut freshman year in their dorm making this music and you know a lot of people would hear the song initially and it's just so damn ... because they risk the keyboard risk at the heart of it\nIs once you once you will never forget it but here there's some contempt attached to it that I think is really powerful and empowering a lot of people have heard this song Rebecca have referenced\nThe connection potential connection to that show Silverstein book the giving tree and to me it's a beautiful story but it's also kind of a heartbreaking one as well this boy never grows up into a man to really get what he's been given\nThe MGM Tucson to sing the key learned his control yourself take only what you need from it it's somewhat elliptical somewhat a bleak\nBut at the same time I think it's a very strong message minister sensibly celebrate tore strong you know ... tenderness and empathy and care for other people other things are the things in this world [noise]\n\n\nNo it kind of recognizing the fact that the world is pretty fragile place and we have to take care of it we have to take care of each other [noise] including a not only people but the environment so if there's enough the quality of the stories catchy somebody you could sing along with and then once you start paying attention to what's going on in the lyrics you say you know\nHere's something this young man should have been breaks you know the ... so when you talk about\nVery declared a pure control yourself take only what you need from it those are kind of empowering lines I think in a way that are traditionally heard in pop songs about match going male so you know kids from Jim T is going to be my ... a prescription for you\n[noise]\n\nThat's a good one Greg I Would have gone with kids in America but I think that that's not as specific as what Rebecca wants and needs so I'm going to do a boy's keeps wing [laughter]\nBy David Bowie not my favorite artist of all time as Greg quickly pointed out when I chose this song but it was co written with writing game the wrong or right [noise]\n\nAnd not giving you but we Nineteen Seventy nine versions from the larger and there was a hit single I'm giving you were covered by Susanna hops the leader of the\nNineteen Ninety six on her first solo album she uncovered voice keeps wing and it was a wonderful\nYou know ... cover of the tune teaching singly catchy you know she captures that little sarcastic self mocking near\nThat but we had as bowl we sang everyone loves Joe the clouds parts for your nothing stands in your way when you're a boy but no hospice thing again right so she's clearly singing at two boys and the ultimate resolution of the song is boys keeps swinging boys always work it out\nYou know it's like we don't give up we get knocked down we pick ourselves up and we try to work things out not because we're in too but of all we can dominate other people you know it's just like maybe work two\nJobs you know to I'm going to get the knock off an entire when I'm trying to change it aren't going to kill me that\nI think is the message of the song and and and Susanna ... singing it I think is inspiring and I hope some day you know your son might connect with that\nFantastic persistence as a lovely I think it was for less characteristic of many boys it's like the force you can use it for good or you go\nBut it's not always healthy either you know when you have a little bit you know any other against the wall no matter how many times you tell them don't do that you know he just had against the war\nWe've been talking to Rebecca from Wheaton and Rebecca we are going to check back with you in a week hope you enjoy that music can be a recommended for your choice\n[noise]\nWere let's return Rebecca our caller who asked for a musical prescription harder to work for you Rebecca\n[noise] I have to say it either worked really well and one of them worked really poorly\nOh oh oh oh oh well let's start with Dr caught his prescription first Rebecca\nAll right so great you actually won\nThat competition or bedrock doctor\nTerms of uh\nThree and a half year old and literally said it is in my brain\n[laughter]\nWins so definitely they responded musically to this one very well um my seven year old who's the most verbal of them she said I like the way that sounds go together and I can't hear the word but I can feel the word\n... song ... she's going to be a good critics yeah\nShe'll do All right with her I kind of examine the lyrics also I said why would we want to control ourselves why would we want to take only what we need\nThe poetry kind of left behind and the rest of it but we talked about the chorus and she said because other people might need it so I think like that's a win for imaging empathy right leg especially from a place of privilege was we were supposed to inspire your son\nExactly but we also talked about like that getting rid of toxic masculinity and replacing it with a new masculine any requires both genders and inspiring both genders to believe that that's a role boys can have it so I think that in terms of that\nIt worked really well if if Esther gets the empathy and then to keep us going to get the empathy\nSo you're older daughter as through gotta she's four years older than your son to Cuba right so your son loved the hook but you're thinking is that your daughter or will no help your son understand as soon as he gets a little older right\nIf it is anything like every other thing we do in our house\nShe will be instructive right and wrong way to proceed\nTo instruct your son it okay are you like to to you didn't hate it either\nI yeah I liked it I'll put it I'll burn it to the city so\nAll right now I had the suggested he's an a ha cover of David Bowie and Brian knows boys keeps swinging you've already dip your hands not did not work\nIt did not kids don't really get tongue in cheek it turns out they're pretty literal minded harmless [laughter] I Want to hear it I was like a\nBoxing zone like\nKiva the boy read it as universal just like people will say well policemen means all police officers men and women right like he he he literally said it's because when we are kids", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "San
