A. P. E. and Atlanta Johnny Kauffman is W. A. B. east political reporter and he gets a started in southern Georgia [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's weeks before the midterm elections small town called ... street running in the back seat of a Ford Focus moving slowly down the street it's getting dark and three women from a local chapter of the Democratic party or peering at the house number's\nWhat's the next we'll forgive passes\nSame thirty three so that's on this side [noise]\nOne of the women steps out and walks up to a house\nThe women are looking for likely Democrats using a list they got from the state party\nAs the sun goes down

through the window [noise]\nNobody comes to the door just clicking turns around and walks back toward the road\nQuarter results development they see [noise]\nWe don't want them to come on and cast their votes [noise] or the person that they're showing\nHer friends are waiting for her in the car but she pauses for a second\nIf a person thing that my vote not long camp a no vote is just like a yes vote\nBut as a responsible citizen\nAnd a person in the state of Georgia you need to have oh\nYou really do you need to teach their children the importance of voting\nYou go out and you think the bushes and you complain which you don't vote\n\nMore than one hundred million Americans of voting age didn't go to the polls in twenty sixty so Democrats and Republicans are trying to get the numbers to work for their side the Democrats are hopeful here in Georgia a Democrat has won the governor's mansion since Nineteen Ninety eight\nOn a story about people who send removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this like\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I'm very that Obama is trying to remember\nYou know the book making\n...\nThen a last July you were taken off the voter less I Would have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen I bet you didn't get any notification that you'd\nBe ... you know\nDid you know there there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss punter tells us she had no idea she'd been perch although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes will be back at Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter last and she had no idea\nIs she was never notify\nOr anything he doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] no I think we need to get down to the bottom of because if it happened to her to Rome and she she\nShe says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost gives people to read mine said that this is a privilege not a right and so now\nAnything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take his aunt to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\n\n\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year\nAnd we found that about a hundred thousand vermouth for not voting and not responding to notices now we don't know how it breaks down by race\nBut if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor when it comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's this illusion\nLet people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration\nBut not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house\nBrands he's voting as a write in to privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period Brian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit I've done it how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on all that but if you don't know on October the first that there is a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and back to presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the polling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W.

Yes sir if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo is a national security threat\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically now or a virus into any part of the tree the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted every other part of the tree [noise]\nLong after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta\nIn cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where Kemp people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge ... filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none fat\nPacking she wrote issue to stay in quote defendants will fail\nTo address that reality if they demean as paranoia for research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert so that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling election now the secretary of state's office does the people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference\nThey say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter]\nUh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\n\nReveals by ... brought us that story [noise]\n\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp Savage to commission that will look at options for replacing the curb voting system by twenty twenty oh and the other four states heading into the midterms they use touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of effort to restrict access to voting around the country but where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal from the center for investigative reporting P.

W. O. R. G. thank you so much\nMm Mm Mm\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is reveal I'm allergic to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that there was like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theory for millions and millions of people [noise] those claims\nHave been totally the book but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically are pretty sweep you off his he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\n[laughter] the worst nightmare constitution bars or keep them from making trouble pretty over\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission\nIt was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything\nThat you will with Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey beg hey yeah so\nKobach is from a small state population wise but he has this big national profiles conservative circles how did that happen\nSo called about is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging elections\nBut the way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could drew a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice\nWould be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\nYou interview Kobach left some or what was the looking person\nWell you know come up makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate\nBut as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys have had it with the ... if you're using the term outlined as an actor and it's not ...\nSend you a thrill all these studies in statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach you know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford\nThen he also has this other big health it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program\nTotal voter registrations in the U. S.\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida [laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage\nSo how's Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where ... percent using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office\nLike the way it's done in all these other states\nAll of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power over prosecutor\nHe doing with it well so far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly pleaded down to misdemeanors", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
