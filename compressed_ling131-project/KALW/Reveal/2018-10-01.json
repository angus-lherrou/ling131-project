S. and work\nRuby says Sandy's case to stay here is a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to point Isabel\nSandy also told Rudy about her four sons\nShe hadn't seen them in about a month\nShe described the moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me that the guard said they had to take her baby away\nIs she said but I'm Still breast feeding him you know [noise] and there's a does it matter she snow but I'm I'm breastfeeding and they said no we still have to take 'em and\nThat are covered it took a breast feeding a baby [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I don't know what else to say about that\n\nI was never able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone Sandy happened to call while I was\nVisiting you'll does apartment in Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\nOr [noise]\n... how are you my daughter\n[noise]\nSandy says she's desperate to leave I left is gonna did you talk to the kids money\n[noise] but\nThen he tells you all the that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with\nYou have to get all it'd be at ... am over that yes because on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids semi me he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go with you on Miami\n\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished if the children to [noise] when Sandy says this looks like she's about to cry\nNow that that means you know the well the truth me I don't have words for you I understand you as a mother\n\nAnd he tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the warmth of his mother\nDo say has to see them in yes that was something else to children complained about that they don't let the kids how the baby not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old almost all the really how was that possible that they don't let them hug each other and I might be a new styles that but as they are brothers they have never been apart\n\nWhat torment Sandy is that the baby's finally getting old enough to recognize people but the only people he's seeing are strangers\nGet the ... you have to have faith my daughter came in because it's the saddest thing for a mother to be separated from her children have I don't mean it was\nOkay and then what I mean that they at that day I get the ... have a good night we'll talk to more okay ... okay blessings make we get in there I mean the market I mean by my sweet girl\n\nBuilders got her own story to tell just a one that connects to Sandy's to hit us and the way she says her\nFamily's been persecuted in Guatemala for generations and everything she loves her shirt to show me a scar that runs across her stomach skins wow you ... it looks like she was cut in half and sewing back together for years she's avoided looking at it in the mirror\nIf we take with us with one of those things maybe eleven it's put out in ... Jimmy that either and\nShe tells me it's a reminder of when she was kidnapped raped and tortured and killed his family was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she and Sandy were targeted Hilda who encouraged Sandy to ask for asylum and do everything legally\nBut now that Sandy and the kids are locked up in a part of the says it feels like the whole asylum thing was ally\n[noise]\nI reached out to ice and customs and border protection but they couldn't answer my question why did the government takes Sandy's kids this summer when there's no evidence that she cross the border illegally and it wasn't just Sandy\nMany parents who are never prosecuted for this we're still separated from their kids there are dozens of examples listed in a lawsuit against the government\nThe American civil liberties union is suing the Trump Administration over for separation of asylum seeking families\nThe lawsuit was filed back in February months before family separation was really in the news\nThe cases famous now it's called miss el versus ice in court documents\nThe administration has to try to explain why it's separated those parents parents who hadn't been accused of entering the country illegally reading through you can see the government's arguments shift first it says it's separated the plaintiff and child because it wasn't sure they were really related\nBut they were that was proven by a DNA test so then the government argues different reasons about why they needed to be separated those arguments weren't enough to persuade the court the judge ruled that this type of\nIn the end I Can't tell you why the government separated children from parents like Sandy all I Know for sure is it wasn't about a crackdown on illegal immigration there wasn't about the Trump Administration enforcing the law\nBecause many families didn't break it\nLate yesterday at the California judge of Bush appointed by the way it should be nationwide injunction ordering immigration agents to take several new steps first\nIn late June the judge in that court case issued an injunction now there was a deadline a ticking clock the government would have to reunite families who've been separated whether they cross illegally are not kids would need to be back with their parents within thirty days the youngest even sooner\nDeadline to reunite the youngest of migrant children with their families and our less than a week away separating families was one thing\nBecause the government put them back together\nAnd wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that\nIt was a massive logistical challenge we're talking about thousands of children in shelters across the country parents locked up\nHow is this going to happen there are reports of math confusion surrounding this process joining us now as Alex is are the health and Human Services secretary Mr Secretary thank you for your time is warning there does seem to be a lot of confusion on this matter what can you tell us this morning declare some of that up\nAbout ... thank you uh first off there's absolutely no confusion on our part uh we have the kids and we're working to comply with the court's order and what that involves you know with\nThe government says everything's fine but with a deadline of July attempt to just a few days away we call Sandy's mom you know that [noise]\nOh I like um like yoga has no idea what's going to happen next you know the tells me there's a lot of confusion\nShe's had trouble reaching Sandy and attention and now she has to hand over documents proving she's related to the grand kids you got your warm ready or\nYou know doesn't know when or if Sandy will see the kids again and if they're all back together how would they get to ...\n... yep them letter of the\nDay before the deadline the Trump Administration admit it's not going to make it maybe only half the youngest children will be reunited with their parents send these kids are in a shelter for migrant children in Phoenix, Arizona it's run by a Texas based company called south west key so I call it the company [noise]\n[noise] Hi sister yeah he just needed to teach them or quarter calling from the Texas Tribune how are you fine\nJeff ... a spokesman for southwest key\nMany of the kids separated at the border are staying at south west key shelters\nMine she says is whether ... years so there's about the plans for redefining 'cause you know these are the shelters rests with it [noise] we're watching the court to say more you are and we hear on the next step surely officer British reduce shuttle\nOkay so does that mean that you haven't heard any plans to step away from them I just said we're reading this year on next steps from the office of refugee so I Would imagine as you all would have liked to get some information about how this will be transported that's just what I'm trying to figure out [noise] for waiting is\nI I got nothing more than we're waiting on direction from the office of refugee resettlement\nWithout mentioning Sandy's name I tell him about her case I've just learned that she's been moved to a detention center near her kids in
