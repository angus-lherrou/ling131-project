{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "... radio remarks on kale W Shepard [laughter]\nWe're a public radio [noise]\nYou do not do for your for your phone\nNumber ... mom over here the human voice [noise]\nWho am I\nA twenty year old student of Brooklyn College with a goal to become successful and everything I Do\nA Christian who love of God and his son Jesus and for that I Am involved in a church I'm On the praise team I ... and I work with children my weekdays consistently attending class every day and go in a trench probably two to four times a week so my brother the Jimmy\nGrowing up uh usually went to church Monday Night\nWhen the night friday night Saturday and Sunday Sunday morning and Sunday evening also\nI Would say that I'm pretty focused and I'm On my way to my destiny so what's the problem you may ask well there isn't any what to say I'm lacking a social life as well as when I get older well they regret anything those thoughts tend to pop in my mind sometimes other times I say take one day at a time\nI said that can surpass anyone thought my weight the loan keeps me from feeling like I Will enjoy life as much\nBut as a young person I Know it should be experiencing a lot more\nWatching movies or TV we see how fun cause can be when people go away and get a quote unquote we'll college light for some one equals partying drinking and having sex\nJust some people have fun in that extent I Want to be able to look at my college years and say I had an enjoyable life and you know all the crazy things I did a good time\nAt the same time it's important for me to live a well conducted lifestyle because of my beliefs\nMost people in their twenties still think the same way some people will say just do whatever you want live life\nOthers would say just do things and destruction\nAround asking people around my age on campus if they ever felt as young person that they were playing but if I'm doing something but because of their religion or any moral values they haven't\nYeah does a actually a lot of stuff the I wanted to do but because of our religion or however such as ah [noise]\nProbably partying I'm\nThings like just getting fossils is prohibited ... if\nThat's when I think about joining or rushing for paternity today do don't really carry any but ah ... structure Christian values and conflicts of where I personally believe\nOne of my church who was a reference and has a doctorate and theology and philosophy told me how she was when she was around my age\nI wasn't the party type I didn't grow up that way um my priorities for different so I'm I was more involved in church more involved in school and more and was in school activities so I didn't really have the time for a party\nWell that's great concerning what she had become and how lifestyle is it's a marble and I do look up to her\nBut then other times hearing things from people who aren't so religious who said just live your life do whatever you want makes me think yes I agree just live life to do what makes you happy just like Justin said\nOr do whatever uh makes me happy and as long as it's not harming anyone else I don't see any problem with it so I pursue whatever I Want\nI've never been fully one sided where I couldn't understand someone's point of view\nBut being in charge I Know that if not all about me but the main purpose of why I'm here I Know that there are some things in life that have to stay away from doing I can do whatever I feel like doing because some things are wrong in God's eyes and I'm just trying to live righteously\n[laughter]\n\nImagine being home on Facebook and all your invitations art invites you to a party that starts eleven PM ending for in the morning\nI Can't do that for three reasons number one my mom will not habits number two I Will be considered not living a proper lifestyle\nAnd that person will love to be in my bed around that time\nI go out partying and then be a tambourine the following Sunday it's just not cool so what else is there to do being a twenty year old in college with beliefs\nWhen I asked my past the high fat young people should live their lives he was the one thing that made me think and I appreciated it\nI was in college not to do things that would\nCause them to do more on our cause them to be all things that will take away from the integrity or their character for as a person\nBut yes there you know I Would encourage them to to focus on the goal the the school goes the\nPersonal ... allies the thing that they want to achieve\nGoals for your before because these are vigilant of it um be be very diligent\nIn Richmond our goal doing everything to make that happen and then I'm during the process that can enjoy all the finest things in life like going out with a friend for dinner crews\nAre skiing trip or or things are those are really bring a balance of fellowship and friendship center not robbing them of integrity or moral values in their lives I'm Still achieving their goals being young you know you ought to adventure is\nEncouraging words from Christians helped me see that I shouldn't worry about things in life but to try enjoy my life the best way I can still knowing what I ought not be doing\nSkiing going on a cruise sounds interesting I haven't done any one of them and now when I think about it there are few other things that I've always wanted to do OK so cool so all they have to do now is invite some friends\nMoney much less a job to pay for what it's all work\nWell there goes a bump in the road but you may not always be a problem lack of knowledge of all the fun things available can be what I Need to look into but one thing I Know I Will check me with something my friends had told me\nI Want to get to that point where I look back and I want to tell my kids when I was younger you know that type of story I just don't want to sit and say well I'm fifty years old and I want to go experienced things that you know you should have done in your teams\nThat is one of the things that I'm focused on top of the story and memories that can keep me company and make me laugh when I get older I don't want to end up having a ... being bored or moving to another level of the night before I experienced a lot\nWhen I asked my brother Jimmy if he ever let that his life and said man my life is so boring\nHe said everything I've done a I guess a purpose for ... and and in terms of you know having fun because I\nI've always had fun growing up but for fun\nBut when I asked him if when he looks back if he would have done anything differently he said no\nMountain mama took nine I'm married with a farm so early get for the home watch\nSome say it's never too late to experience whatever you want no matter how old you are\nThat's true to an extent but what if I don't live up to see fifty\nThan what my mind is and will always be an area in which I think about a lot of things but somehow I always get answers for them so I'll continue to live my life taking it one day at a time worrying about absolutely\nYou're listening to NPR rex remarried [noise]\nFind out more and explore the amazing world independent

took Vermont and the door yard on the week before Christmas we bring you buy nothing day by Jesse I'm In west welcome [noise]\nOnly one holiday I actively celebrate this time of year and that's buy nothing day happens in November the day after Thanksgiving sort of a made up holiday\nAdbusters in wired made it into an international thing back in Nineteen Ninety two but it never got the traction of some of the other recent holidays that I consider to be made up\nLike administrator professionals' day for example but to be fair that has been around since Nineteen fifty two and it's probably because you can't really shop for it I'm not religious I grew up in a small town about the size of rental Vermont where I live now and we had a Christmas tree at home but never went to church\nPeople around here get really Christmas see which is actually usually fun to be around but it doesn't resonate with me personally in a big way as a holiday so here's what I Do for buy nothing day for the entire day I don't buy anything and I go for a walk outside\nThat's it and I do it every year\nI got the idea for the walk outside part of it from Bill McKibben his first book the age of missing information which he wrote in Nineteen Ninety two\nYou probably know McKibben he's the guy behind three fifty dot org he's an earnest sensible Vermont or from rich and concerned about climate change and other things that are maybe ruining world\nThis was back in the earlier days of cable TV an endless ... on what would actually beyond those five hundred channels we were promised\nMcKibben found the city that had the most cable channels Fairfax, Virginia and recorded twenty four hours of its programming and then he watched all of them over a period of about six months two thousand hours of television\nAnd then he spent twenty four hours in the Adirondacks just thinking about things and he wrote a book comparing the experience is\nWhat sets wilderness apart in the modern day he said it's not that it's dangerous it's almost certainly safer than any town a road you can so they say be alone in a crowded room for full of exotic animals there are more at the zoo it's that five miles out in the woods you can't buy\nAnything the Cuban later wrote a book hundred dollar holiday case for more joyful Christmas which was a project on the local churches to spend more money and time making sure everyone had their basic needs met and less money and effort on the shopping part of Christmas\nCreating genuine community traditions that instilled a sense of wellbeing and fellowship not feelings of urgency in competition my partner and I already have a twenty dollar ish limit for any holiday exchanges with bonus points being given for best recycled wrapping paper\nHe usually wins because he uses old maps\nLast year I was given some of that green lobby that you can use to get all\nA really thoughtful gift it's odd for me to be in a culture where by something is thought of as a positive message and don't buy something is somehow political\nWe've made a national anti holiday out of the day after Thanksgiving and somehow feel okay that the term Black Friday implies that if we don't shop these giant stores may go out of business since they've been operating in the red since January\nSetting aside this otherwise Black Friday for not buying anything and going for a long walk seemed like not such a big sacrifice considering\nAt the same time it required advanced planning was I going to drive anywhere that I have gas in the car that I have bills that were do that I have enough coffee and milk in the house did using gift cards count what about coupons for free things had like Netflix\nKendall apps barter public transportation tipping learning about the\nPressure points is a good part of thinking about consumerism\nThe good thing about a made up holidays is that you can also make up your own rules in the end we decided to aim for a negative cash flow for buy nothing day and plan to donate a dozen pairs of glasses that had belonged to my father and then we next that idea and decided not to get in the car at all\nPart of buying nothing for me is giving myself permission to say that I don't really enjoy shopping not real good and parking lots fluorescent lights make me a little jumpy I can get judgments about other people's parenting techniques and then I get mad at myself for that\nTyped in overlapping shrieking Christmas carols make this unease worse than usual\nI Can't stop thinking somehow about how the price of everything is calculated through some formula that takes into account the price of the cheap lighting and the music licensing and the narrow parking lot lines\nAnd yet overtime I've moved somewhere where I can get more of the things I have to shop for and places without terrible parking lots or\nPiped in carols places where I mostly run into my neighbors and where the money I spend goes to employ my other neighbors I Need less and I buy less\nIt's not for everyone and that's okay with me too\nSo on buy nothing day we ate leftovers from the day before we read books on the couch under a blanket we fed the birds and check to see if there were any frogs left and the frog pond there weren't and we went for a three mile walk as the sun was setting and talked about the previous buy nothing day that\nWe could remember [noise] it was a pretty great

beginning and I wanted it to unfold in front of me and I didn't know if it was going to unfold in any kind of interesting way and I had to do a fair amount of upfront recording just to find the characters that I thought\nI had the greatest chance that there would be something surprising and maybe a twister too\nHarping on a topic I have a tendency to harp on notice the Karen's planning her story in advance not entirely but enough to know if she has a minimum a story she's not leaving everything up in the air and hopes the radio God's smile upon her microphone\nJust saying anyway back to care and she says just because you think there's a longer story doesn't mean there is one that requires a leap of faith\nThe leap of faith list that there would be a story worth telling I just kind of cross my fingers and hoped that it would I didn't know whether they were going to let me continue interviewing them I'm probably knew they would get tired of the project and and tell me they didn't want me to interview them any more [noise]\nUm I didn't know if there would be anything interesting that happened during that period of time said that leap of faith was was really that there would be enough twists and turns and surprises in following this group of people to warrant a long form documentary\nSo when she left the three doctors looking for surprises and changes in the characters trust was key\nYeah that that was pretty difficult actually [laughter] and and that is probably\nThe most compelling reason that you really need a year to do a story like this um you know it took me probably three or four months just to gain the trust of\nThe residents I was interviewing and the um the resident director's um\nThe PR department had to sort of um give me the go ahead to meet with these residents on my own and not always have a hospital representative there that was that was sort of my ground rule but they didn't agree to that right off the bat\nAnd then there were the patients they required a wait and see approach on her part\nSome of the time it was just me hanging out backstage hoping that a patient would come in um who would be willing to have me you know in their appointment\nHaiti job ends isn't a good mood is she looks at her roster of patients she's invited me to hang out on her shift on this fall morning her first patient as a no show the second is one of

taking a lot of medication\nHow did you secure permission to record from the patient stands up at the end um I didn't [laughter]\nI figured that was the PR departments job\nSo anytime that um you know that anyone let me wander around the hospital or wander around the clinic\nUm I was I was very upfront I just talked to the um the patience and I just told them what I was doing um but if there was a PR person there they had them sign a waiver for their protection\nBut I didn't feel like that was my responsibility was my responsibility to make sure that everybody knew what I was doing there why I was doing it\nUm and that they agreed you know if they wanted their name in or they didn't want their name in or they didn't want their voice you know I completely respect what they said\nA journalist at a conference I attended some years ago so the following don't waste a doctor's time\nYou'd reported quite a bit on physicians and said he felt like you needed to develop a very high level of expertise from the subject area if you didn't the doctors would be less willing to be interviewed and followed they'd be wasting their time with the reporter who wasn't up to speed was the implication will care and says she had the opposite experience\nWell first of all I don't really I didn't really approach physicians any differently than I approach most of the people that I interview\nMuch about what it takes to become a doctor or they don't know about all of these pressures on residents and so I just start asking from a very basic level um\nAnd and I do think that over the course of my interviews they can tell that I've done my research and that I you know I asked the questions that that show that you know I Do understand that background to these issues but I just want them to still explain it any way from a very basic level\nMany residents become primary care doctors because of their desire for social justice plus there's opportunity to for a long term relationships with patients ticked up to a job and for example we heard her in the opening\nI like establishing relationships with people and getting to know them outside of what their medical diagnoses are and I like
