things are when somebody's balding I can spot that immediately right and I said before we leave and yes\nBecause I see some people with the confidence of a person with a full head of hair\nBut I Know that that confidence is it's misguided ... or it's not long for this world\nAnd I think um you know I just see I see a lotta dates happening which is when to humans are figuring out whether you know they were not there will or not right I actually am not it's not clear to me while they're working on\nBut there's some question between them ... which is like you know whether we are mostly the the big issue around lampposts and often they lean against\nSing against each other and they're pushing their mouth on each other and they're like well we won't we do want to I don't know\nAnd so that's kind of like interesting to me 'cause I'm like make up your mind get off me\nYou know if the answer to that question will they won't they yeah is that they will write youth kind of played a formative role in their lives you know the the question is will will they be together\nYeah I Do have some role in that and I do like the thought I guess of\nYou know being an important part of someone's

there's this beautiful family photograph\nAnd they wait and I watched and I watch and watch and he fell asleep [noise] [noise]\nWhat happened to all of a sudden they get very excited it's like [noise] I got to get this you know and then I shoot it and I hate golfing guesses I Can't because I Want to get out\nI guess one because it's on your turn to for me to be watching that [noise]\n\nThey're

they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle them to fight the lawsuit clearly two million dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose and all sorts constitute a massive distraction for management of companies especially a small\nEight man shop like my ...\nSix months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase and discovery phase we ask\nThe patent for all to please provide screen shots of FARC where the infringement of their pattern was actually occurring now perhaps it's because there's no such screen shots actually existed\nBut suddenly to spray wanted a subtle their attorney\nUh yes my company is having a reorganization on our end\nMind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern LA with no employees and\nWe like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind giving us your best and final\nOffer the my response how about nothing [noise]\nWe didn't\nHave high hopes for that outcome\nBut they don't know counter offer\nNow as mentioned before\nOne of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no nondisclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen well during the settlement process when we received our copy I struck at my attorney said nah no chance of that working it came back sign\nNow why you can call them\nThey're not under India either no wonder I learned from this case well three the first of all if you can don't fight the patent fight the infringement titans are very difficult to overturn infringement there's a lot easier to disapprove secondly\nMaking it clear from the beginning that need to you have no money at all or that you would rather spend the money with your attorney fighting the trolls and actually giving them the money\nNow the reason this word is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover and settlements if it becomes clear to them that they can recover any money they become less interested in pursuing the case\nFinally make sure that you can tell them they will make this process as annoying and is painful and as difficult as possible for them\nNow this is a tactic that controls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they're paid on can tendency works really really well in reverse don't forget that so what does this mean well the kind of saw 'em up\nIts goes boils down to one thing don't negotiate with terrorists [noise]\nPatent trolls are done more damage\nOrganization in the history every year\nAnd what do they do with that money\nThey plow right back into following more troll lawsuits now this is going into soccer I supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the ... the system and the problem with that is is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the ...\nThe healthcare industry would like stronger protections for inventors the high tech industry would like stronger protections for producers have these goals are necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds and as a result patent trolls can kind of living the space in between so unfortunately I'm not smart enough to how

monsters university [noise]\nLet's pause just for a second and explain a little bit of what's going on here\nYeah I agree so first of all monsters university and tells the story about monsters attending a university for monsters and\nParticularly nerdy monster Mike ... wants to be accepted by the cooler students school so he and his friends take on an athletic challenge the toxicity challenge\nIn one part of it is running as fast as they can all other monsters throughout what are called ... and that's all they're sort of spiky jellyfish she\nWent to glow actually hits a monster his skin instantly swells into a comic leads giant will [noise]\nOkay so sure that scene again\nWhat you're hearing or the monsters getting hit by a lower chance as they race each other\nIs a great thing about animation is that there's no sound to begin with very that's very freeing and that is if it's all built from the ground\nMyers is one of the designers behind all of the sounds you just heard\nOh in a corner of the sprawling Skywalker Ranch up in ...\nOh man I Can't believe it or is that you know Oscar that is not an Oscar that is a it's actually see three PM\n[noise] human

can virtually sample anything into it [noise]\n\nAnd they played sounds strange scene that film projects onto the movie screen\nWhen you watch the scene for the first time what do you do first\nCry openly weep open the you know I I I you look at it and oh my God how will we ever get to a spot where we have it all together but I'm so your mind starts to think about certain things will what will that\nSounds like and how should that work together and how do we make each sound distinctive because they all happened very fast\nSo back to that clip from monsters university\nTom and his team had to create sounds from us that everything but the voices and the sounds that the fully I think like footsteps or opening and closing doors for everything else the team has to invent the sounds that world and this seems that sounds have to go across both the danger and the comedy of what's happening\n[noise] wow [laughter] oh my gosh [laughter]\nThis last character gets hit he gets hit three\nTimes and expands and then they shoot one into his mouth and his whole body expanse obviously that one needs to be sort of bigger [noise]\nAnd needs to be kind of the pay off the fattest a mean body inflation and uh so you try and very the frequency so you can build a rhythm and and you know cut reach a climax\nAnd the sound has to change throughout the scene otherwise it wouldn't seem realistic and it would for the audience\nIt flies in it stings and then there's an inflation\nSo there's three aspects to each one of those things that come in and there are hundreds of them in the fly by so such a figure out how do we how do we get that idea of one two three across and then with so many different ones how do you do it so it doesn't just become you know a mess of sound\nCan you tell us specifically\nHow you made the lower chin flying through the air and hitting a buddy okay what do we actually hearing\nLet's well uh the first the ...\nBy is a tone sort of it are synthesized tone that I put through a Doppler program pitch the down a little bit I think I added a little sort of bacon frying with it or to give it some texture\nAnd this isn't the fancy industry term it's literally the sound of\nBacon in the pants [noise] to give it that kind of seasonally texture\nAnd beyond that pitched uptown and bacon frying there's also the sound of too hot wheels cars banging into each other\nWe don't have that original recording but this is what we think it might sound like [noise]\nWater bottle [noise] so\nWhy you may ask do they go to all this trouble why not just throw something or chin like through the air and record that\nTom says it gets tricky to record in the real world because you can't necessarily control that sound in order to explain this to us he tells us a story that infamous at Skywalker Ranch\nRandy Tom who's the director of sound design at Skywalker\nOnce went to collect sounds from a nuclear facility\nAnd it didn't really work out or it\nWas very sort of diffuse and mushy and the sound was not what you expected to be but as he was leaving [noise]\nThere was a water cooler that had a specific kind of home and blue when he went by\nThe sound of the water cooler blue thing and that's what he ended up using to represent the nuclear facility\nSound designer Walter March when fed\nSound kind of sneak send the side door the design doesn't have to knock you over it's there to enhance your experience to keep you inside the story and the most [noise]\nThe emotional\nComponent is at least as important as the literal component you have to be open to different things and a sink beyond the specifics of whatever something would literally show like because oftentimes that's not the most interesting with the most dramatic\nFor example there's a scene toward the end of monsters university where Mike was asking that nerdy monster\nHas to roar it's got to be a really particular kind of roar too because it makes a pretty little guy it had to be good but not great I actually did use\nThe vocal or did you sort of my own vocal and pitched it so\nIt had some body it's big and scary but not quite so big and scary [noise]\n\nTom had to hit just the right balance about the audience would believe that that for command of monsters mouse instead of his own\nIn a way that's what he's doing through the entire film and it's the ultimate test of a good sound designer\nTo make an animated world exist Tom has to make the audience forget that\nStories twenty four seven online is on the air you're listening to the radio revenge for your your money

planet to other violence is in the past and folks to spare then too but Linda says there's room for optimism\nLet's talk about Henry David Thoreau he was reading a at the time the height of deforestation in New England we think about him at Penn with a pencil you know often the beautiful woods\nForget it that's not true she she was writing as they were cutting down in the woods as New England in order to clear at for agriculture and he would write in his journal thank God they can't cut down the clouds\nAnd he would lament the loss of the so called noble or animals and he meant the deer and the bear the mountain lion you know in the time of his day the biggest thing left in the woods was a mosque ... nobody would even seen a deer in a generation\nWell fast forward to today and over a six state region of New England we see one of the most glorious and profound ... of our time as people walked away from these farms to go work in cities and do other kinds of jobs\nAre what came back\nThe trees and with them the animals at day care and moves are in such profoundly great numbers it's actually kind of a problem for people who in a modern in modern days have not lived so closely with so much wildlife\nAnd I take so much encouragement from that and that nature is resilient does rebound come back\nYou know there's a lesson there that not all\nNature that that force that

across\nIsn't that phenomenal it really is the most complex structure known to mankind it underlies our creativity and our personalities and not only that but it can grow and change in response to the environment is a phenomenal man\nIn his house and the human body they have a symbiotic relationship the brain affects the body the body affects the brain\nAnd with all of that I was a guard dog and just thought this is the most exciting interesting fascinating thing I've ever heard of it I'm so glad I'm In college I Want to be a nurse and I just\n[noise]\nWell to this day she's the best teacher that I've ever experienced in my in my entire career\nAnd it's because she she was so\nPresent and then gauge and fascinated truly fascinated with\nThe material that she was presenting she has the flare for the dramatic\nAnd she wrote everything on the chalk board she said it was because if I write it down your going to write it down and that gets into your memory and so at the end of the class you're you've already learned most of what you need to learn I have\nTo tell you why I still use ... and do not in power point\nBecause I studied learning mechanisms long enough to know that it takes time take in the primary information and associate it I feel if I'd a flash on things like this you don't get it if you are right you use your kind of set accent\nThat's one way it slows me down it slows you down and I also repeat all the time because we know repeating reinforce so where are you saying things that have been shown for learning rather than just keeping up with technology\nAt the beginning I was captivated with the nurse science experiments that marrying diamond herself described and she had done so she did these classic studies in the Nineteen sixties showing what happens to the brains of rats if they were raised and what they called enriched environment\n\nCertain rich environment is an environment where rats had lots of poised to play with and lots of other rap to play with it a much bigger space and you can think of it kind of like the Disney World of environments\nAnd watch the show was the brains of rats raised in those enriched environments where actually bigger the outer covering the brain called the cortex actually grew significantly larger compared to rats that were\nRaised in impoverished environments where there was only one one rat in a cage with no toys [noise]\nTools we decided to publish it and I spoke to the American association of Annapolis first big conference that I had it for ...\nThere weren't too many women [laughter] agenda ... when I finished a man in the back roads up and it was a big auditorium stood up and shouted [laughter]\nYoung lady that brain cannot change\nNobody had thought that you could have an enriched environment specifically change your brain and an impoverish one change a parade\nWas the first\nNobody else had made such measurement found these results we were terribly excited about\nHer work and this environmental enrichment and brain plasticity was so influential on me I was fascinated both with the brain and with brain plasticity and so when I went to graduate school\nI definitely was was drawn to other forms of experiments that that addressed brain plasticity and my form of brain plasticity that I became fascinated with in graduate school was memory\nEveryday brain plasticity if I learned something new if I learn the name of somebody new and I'm able to remember it sometime later\nMy brain is change and I wanted to try and understand what that change was and really identify it\n... ... ... ... ... it's it's funny\nBrain cells you have to say is a little bit like fishing you don't know exactly what I Know the campuses involved I didn't know what I'm going to find there so I I put my little fishing rod which is a very very thin micro electrode down in today but campus so I can listen in on what these cells are doing\n[noise]\nI Would be listening to a cell as an animal was starting to learn something new and someone be doing much of anything that would just be firing every once in a while that I could hear on the audio monitor but\nThen one day [noise] I noticed that just as the animals started to learn a particular association the cell that was on the end of my electrode starts to fire more and more consistently right as the animal was learning in\nAs the ... really put it into his memory more more and more strongly would call that consolidating the number he got better and better and by the end of the session he was performing that association at a hundred percent correct [noise]\n\nI thought well maybe maybe I was hearing things but then I went back and analyze the data and when I saw is that this out in about twenty percent of all the cells that are recorded from the campus would change dramatically in just messy animal was learning a new association\nOnce I got used to I could actually hear this happening\n\nAnd listen to those cells and being able to identify them as we listen to them was kind of like listening to the birth of a new memory [noise]\n\nIt was so exciting to find these cells and again it was a little bit like fishing I didn't know what I was going to catch a tiny little fish or a big fish\nIt turned out to be a pretty big fish because this was the finding that got me tenure at New York university who is very very important kind of professionally for me but just so exciting because it literally took five years\nTo get this experiment off the ground you get the animals to learn and to be able to get the recordings to work and even then after everything was working we didn't know what we're going to get that doesn't guarantee success\n\nBut I have to say that I realized at that point that there was something amiss I had turned into my own lab\nRat just going from my home to work and and working working really hard to get all this work done and going back home and going to sleep\nAnd you know I was living in New York City and there was so much out there and I was taking advantage of none of it not only that I was about twenty pounds overweight because of the amazing takeout food in New York\nAnd I realized at some point that I needed to\nRebalance my life in lots of different ways and I'm march straight to the new Jim that opened up not too far away from my work and I signed up and I signed up for a personal trainer to to make sure that I Would come to the gym and get my workouts and that was the best thing that I could do\nIt was amazing you start training regularly and your body responds\nJust like the brain put the brand new environment it responds with what I learned in Marion diamonds lab and I was learning on my own the hard way\nThat you put yourself in the situation and your body responds it did so actually beautifully and I ended up I'm losing twenty five pounds and I felt great\nThat goes for the brain as well as for muscles you use it or you lose it\nUse it or lose it with you\nTo use sitting around doing nothing you lose it right\nWith me [noise]\nI found this work out that I loved and this is a a a workout that\nCombines physical movements from boxing and dance and yoga with positive ... an affirmation yell things out like\nI Will see than I Am stronger now\nI loved it so much that I learned how to teach it\nBet Sunday Morning at

go to trial you could go to trial but there is a terrible risk associated with going to travel with what we call the jury texture gonna get punished a whole lot more severely\nSo you have attorneys

me\nThere's a kind of charging their into I mean here you are in this room with thirty five hundred so [noise]\n\nHad and people feel very in a way offended by this work because it deals with death which is a taboo\nAnd it deals with crazy people write quote unquote which is taboo\nCombines that with a kind of spectacular beauty\nThat combination is really taboo\nWhen it happened yet toward you is this the canisters don't just look normal\nBut the twenty four years in which they sat and an underground vault it was flooded repeatedly been up to anyone finally in two thousand they were moved to a dry storage room and that's where David myself first got a peek at the remarkable ways\nIn which the copper surfaces of the canisters evolved each different from the next\n... they're in a sense miner logical portraits of the individuals who are within them\nOh my God look at that one\nThat on this looks like a cave drawing doesn't it like a bird that Flynn Sherman who's a painter from Key West\nThat's gorgeous wow for this or\nThis has an underwater quality of the basic color and most of them this is wonderful a burnt orange with gold highlights and then when this cobalt blue comes in and really in blue\nIt's really hot glue okay these looks at us like they are up that ...\nThat says soft and missiles and kind of violent while\nMineral deposits crummy huge portions of many Afghans are with national building museum all electric can decode brain agua as thick and crustaceans of plight green and blue and gleaming copper underneath it all\nThe colors are just phenomenal the upper half or so of this canister has got the the black and the red color what looks like the ... you see that when you look at sort of a penny\nJim Webster is a geologist and curator of mineral deposits at the American museum of natural history and his very cool office with its rocks and charts and maps I asked him what's going on here\nI suspect that much of the blue is either a cup or sulfate or cover carbonate minerals as you are right which is a natural\nBlue copper carbonate minerals\nAnd then the green which is ...\nAnd the other thing I see which is fairly apparent as a white salty material and there are ... that form a white material and the Koreans everywhere\nAnd my understanding is these canisters were exposed to flooding multiple times inside of all a concrete floor it would be hugely source for the carbonate and really the copper carbonate they're not extremely soluble in water so it would take take years we don't talk\nI think about things and yet here is this example of just kind of spectacular\nMiner illogical\nThat these cancers are undergoing\nMost living organisms are largely water\nSo ... when the when the body is cremated the water is released was driven off his team are Bones Are largely calcium phosphate and so in fact they don't burn and they're stable to very high temperatures so at the end of burning of human buddies that will be the charred remains of our bones\nSo apparently those Bones Are crushed up to make a fine powder and the powders what's put inside these canisters\nWebster explains that the phosphorus and the phone's\nCombined with the concert to create the mineral turquoise on some of the cancers\nStill it's hard to nail these ballots down because the colors are still changing\nAs I returned to the hospital over the course of two years\nAnd there were certain cancers that I Would look at it again and again\nSomething that appeared that kind of deep midnight blue might become almost electric called off months later\nThe water level the humidity during a given to the temperature cold day versus a hot day potentially the amount of carbon dioxide from one year to another to another all of these factors may well cause these minerals to change from one to another\nAll the information these canisters the colors the ongoing changes remind me in some way it's the landscape of Iceland stand to top the mountain ridge there and you see geological history writ large forms of law for turf and stamped well\nIt rocks it's almost like people liken it to the pages in a book kind of opening a book of earth's history\nSo maybe the library at the guy is like the ancient Icelandic sockets or like footprint on a dirt path or the smell of someone who's no longer in the [noise]\nI think that's what I'm looking for work at\nThe tension between the natural sciences what's verifiable what's real and the unknown or the on represent a bomb and and and so that I think is what activates these images [noise] what is real and what is it matched generic what these measurable indefinable and what is\nEventually to inevitable [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI'm Kurt Anderson\nThere is a singer songwriter named Ali ... is Kobe though who has

[noise] um\n\nHe did your dad give you any good advice on what you mean when I was growing up yeah not that I can recall but when I went to prison\nHe does he watch your back [laughter]\nWas that helpful I mean it was cool covered for me um you know I guess it showed that he cared a mutt [laughter] okay well being a parent is a lot more than giving advice but if you're in prison it's hard to even do that\nBecause you're in prison yeah but you can actually give advice and be adapted prison it's harder but a lot of guys here have children and there's all sorts of different ways that they do it and that's what we're going to hear about today and mainly we're going to focus on this guy here\nSo when I was told I was going to be a father started to think about\nWhat type of father did I plan on\nBeing Derek how the way has been incarcerated for Twenty one years when his son was born there was a twenty four year old drug dealer and had a lot on his mind\nAnd live in a way that I was living a really need to change\nThat needing to change and actually changing your life scared now knows I two different things\nThat I'm at the hospital with mom and seeing his face was like wow\nIt was like a miracle was like man this is a human being is I'm responsible for human me and so the man with came with that was a whole lot of emotions\nA whole lot a whole lot\nThat I wasn't even really prepared for oh had the even the motion ... deal with it\nAnd I just didn't know how to say\nThis child is what's most important I just didn't have the tools\n\nIn spite of being a new that he didn't change when\nI started getting sucked into the criminal lifestyle criminal thinking criminal behavior after that it was one of the dogs you\nKnow um give me a typical day like what was your you got up and then\nAlso I Would I Would get up at of course I Would you know have girlfriends strolled all over the city [noise]\nSo it depends on what girlfriend house I was at ... you know so I Would get up and kind of call around and see where everybody was doing where everybody was on the ah [noise] um but I was you know hit the freeway to get to this block where everybody was I had to kind of kickback see what was going on\nUm so the typical day really was like me really making sure that the ... the spot where we wish I had had dope out there you know people out there they are ready to spot was rolling\nI'm so out of there for a minute but I Would always be trying to run and see what would the next woman was she was doing that but I just love women [laughter]\nThere was living in life he was young he had money women he thought he was on top of it all\nThe soda downfall was I'm\nBeginning really two\nHuge drugs\nAnd then he really got in trouble in Nineteen Ninety seven less than a year after his son was born Derek was arrested for first degree murder and sentenced to thirty seven years to life\nThe next time Jackson his son he was in prison behind thick glass in ... and\nSo yeah so he came to visit on his on his first birthday and I'm just looking at him and the some of my thoughts was or\nWas this glass represent our relationship and um you know for the for the first time I was realizing that they can like that is a possibility that I may never get an opportunity to to see him as a child and grow up and to have some kind of influence in his life [noise]\nSomebody\nOne might lead\nTo my own self I I couldn't find a way out I wanted to do something different but I didn't know how and and come into prison\nActually really gave me the opportunity to sit down and really examine my life in the beginning to get the courage to do something different with my life\n\nIn prison Derek got religion and he's now in prison creature with a full on congregation\nSo if it does present you're talking about\nThis I think a lot of guys\nDid religion fake religion religious but they're not\nLike the real deal how do you know\nYou didn't want his sermons in here just\nAnd he walked to walk you know just walk the walk on the pulpit he walked to walk on the yard and he'd go around and counsels people counsel to use so yeah he's real\nBut he couldn't counts for his own son when ... mother died the boys maternal grandmother took him in and she thought it was best to keep him away from his father and Derek only heard what was going on second and third hand\nSo when he was growing up I heard good things early on you know him being a church and and I would send an bibles can play football and you know him going to different schools of ... and and then I started hearing the different things\nAbout him being\nYou know industry lie for going forward and I was really disappointed and even here that made me feel grief in pain and\nSo he was basically growing up like you were growing up like I was\n[noise]\nThere was sort of want to get a second chance to Paris\nAnd we're going to hear about that in a minute but first here's another prison dad with a very different experience of parenting from prison [noise]\nI could have been a a a dad at Seventeen and been just absolutely happy and dedicated and I think I could get a been a good pop you know as a kid so it was something I wanted and uh I I was excited\nConfident hopeful and fulfilled\nJohn this thirty five when his first child was born when he committed the crime that led him to prison his kids were three eight and nine years old\nI happen so suddenly it was the the night of December twentieth and I was coming back from a Christmas Party and it was one of those drinking and driving fatality cases [noise] so I didn't have time to to to think well what what would happen if I were taken away from my kids that are never never occurred to me [noise]\n\n[laughter] it's a lifetime [laughter] if you like Twenty years ago [laughter]\nMuscles goals [laughter]\nI Know what it is [laughter] that's crazy that yeah that wouldn't have anything\nNow that we do in this hour which is a you know ... and ...\nAnd even that was awkward man you don't but I had to force myself through it like and like this with the reality man like you know I'm like why is that\nI'll watch them walk up the stairs sometimes right I'm walking behind he always going faster than me and I'll watch him go up and I remember how how I used to walk and so we're not watching walk up the stairs sometimes I'm like\nJust staring at him like man look at me that is me and sometimes it is so overwhelming because nobody wants prison for their child and so it makes me more protective\nYou know now more like okay where are you at and and I'll I'll see them but I don't let them see me [laughter]\nThat brings up a whole nother thing but yeah just watching them watching his mannerisms how we interact with people on the tea or hardly interact with people in the prison very outgoing\nAnd I tell them is all the time I saw you just a function in um extrovert because really your introvert liked them [laughter] you really want to be by yourself you really do good by yourself\nBecause we're outgoing people want you know people will talk to us and like us and so I see that it you know\nBut he has no problem being myself [laughter] we\nBasically do anything just like when I get ... but I go outside at night and I just be walking when now just walking like what the hell is you're doing out here you're like me I feel like being by that and then we both ended up just being out there walking near we always run into each other out there like man [noise]\n\nI Am nervous every time the alarm goes off I didn't like where is he\nIs involved is there was a fight 'em [laughter]\nYou know and so for me it is an anxious Dave [laughter] now do with my parents went through wow serious you report you so I'm telling you [laughter]\nMm [noise]\n\nWho we last heard from him in season one and I are talking about the boom boom in\nOh yes and a Mission Impossible conception of my son\nThat's maverick and seen the one he told us how him and his wife decided to start a family why he was in prison here's a clip from that episode\nAnd we had mastered the art of being intimate on the patio\nIt got us to talking and she was like I Wish I could have a key right now and that got me to think and I'm like\nOh man this is the only thing that you can give her you um you should go and have you ever it is I Would only get a visit like maybe once\nHow old is he now he is Fifteen Years old so he's a teenager man\n... been in prison for his son's entire life\nBut they have visited and phone calls and letters yeah that's what you got to work with if you want to be an active parent print and starting about a year ago mavericks began having family does it and that's one of the biggest privileges here is huge that's when your wife and your kids or it can be your parents and siblings\nCome to stay with you for a few days and the hottest year and we acts mavericks to tell us about the latest family visit he had with his wife and I saw\nA cut his hair for the first time and that's like a rite of passage for every father to cut his son's here at some point in time and he was scared at first because the whole month before the visit I told your baggage or haircut don't get your hair cut 'em cut your hair\nAnd he's like oh All right uh you know he was skeptical\nAnd then I brought my ma clippers out and when it came time to do it might take off her shirt and he's an bears because you know he's he's a little bit fellow for his age and he was like oh and it was so\nFunny I'm like boy if you don't stop him

he was like oh my oh my goodness this is this is great you know I got to pay for it was ...\nI was like yeah boy you won't be able to get that every day when I come home\nAnd it it just gave me a glimpse of how thirsty he is to have a father and his life\nBut I Believe that a surety of\nExactly when I was going to come home it was occupied too much of his mind I got him worrying\nAbout me in here so much where he can't focus in class and that's what hurts me the most me not being able to help him process\nThis me not being able to be there to to just be there to help him to hold him to let him know what is going to be All right\n[noise]\nIt's been a long struggle but the good news is is some might have is dead on some maverick has a date which means he could be released on parole sometime this year [noise]\n\nIn a ... an easy one\nIt happened with your son [noise]\nYeah so uh [noise] um [noise] actually got a call at work\nAnd said about um [noise]\nThey were ready to transfer
