thing you know they're relying upon hunting and fishing to feed themselves while they're on the river\nAnd there was a big difference and equipment to\nThis is the ... the necessities and measure mother of a mansion and they had to really want to go to these rivers and do that\nThere was no commercially made rafting equipment so all their life jackets their pants you know that wraps everything was thought out carefully to keep it really light and that was handmade and that was what they could afford\nThe Russian rafters made as much of their gear as\nPossible they're homemade frames made out of bladders that were covered in canvas had a rubber bladder on the inside he would carry those to the put in and then they would create a fan of these birch are I guess bridge mentions yeah for ...\nAnd they lash them together with whatever they had string 'em sit new whenever\nI got to see pictures of the Russian wraps and I truly couldn't believe it I mean it looked like something straight out of Huckleberry Finn but the thing is the homemade rafts worked even through raging whitewater\nAll these guys a lot of them are engineers and you know they had very professional jobs and some of them that they just they didn't have access to a lot of equipment\nBut that didn't really seem to be an issue for them in fact I don't remember something one of their Russian teammates said near the start of the trip\nAmericans very nice people I think a lot of stuff and I don't\nThat was ... you remember that [noise]\n\nAll through the trip as the Russians than Americans explored the river and got the hang out more what they notice was pretty simple it wasn't about politics which country was better or even more powerful but they noticed was how people approached getting down the river but they considered necessary to do it\nAt one point in the trip out of supply stop the Russian host asked if the Americans wanted what was described as forty kilos of fresh meat and they said yes\nEnough you know their power and all the food up helicopter showing up were loaded it all up and they have to bring down a couple of sheep with their\nFresh meat right there so they just throw those things in the chopper with us\nSo the live sheep end up in the boat with the rest of the supplies and they continue down river eventually they stop and make camp but this whole live sheep thing it isn't sitting well with one of the American team it's one\nOf our um participants decided she would feed the meat and says she anti though that shape and it took off and then there's those Russian guys where they were gone I never signed one run so fast and so the sheep met at an early end because they weren't going to have it get away again\nEarl and Glenda and everyone else on their team went to the Soviet Union with lofty goal to do team building while exploring and remote wilderness and they did but they learned something much simpler to\nYou know ignorance of um\nA different culture is um and and I

story with the American history guys each week back story takes the topic say first disease or college sports and explores the history of that topic in America here that guy\nI'm Brian about our ... and ...\nWe're talking today about the history of women and the American workplace before the break we were discussing what working life would have looked like for African American women in the decades fall when the under slavery we're going to go back a little bit further now and consider the workplace picture from another perspective that of young white women\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century they too were leaving the home and what might strike Jewish rosy numbers\nBy Eighteen fifty some twenty percent of on married white women were working outside the home and what many of them and countered all too often was the only wanted sexual attraction of their employers of our producers Nina honest\nI'm Wondering about the options available for women in the situation here's Nina tell us what you discovered\nThe first thing I found when I started looking into this story is that the thing we would call sexual harassment was all over the place in the nineteenth century\nI think that this might have been one of the greatest things that women fared\nThis is Lee Vanderbilt she's a law professor at the University of Iowa was written about sexual predation in this period\nAnd that's one of the reasons that there were so many limitations on the jobs that women could even take one of the ways to cut down on sexual harassment were simply not permit women to go to work in certain places [noise] keeps them away from men\nWhen economic necessity or their families to send them out into the world is launder says domestic servants and sometimes is factory workers it was very clear who is responsible for keeping them safe the women themselves\nBecause people at the time I Believe that chased women would not consent to sex before marriage no matter the circumstances\nMen were naturally\n... women were not if the man pursuit [noise] even with physical force or even with the threat that you will be dismissed if you do not submit the woman was simply instructed to refuse [laughter] that's it [noise]\nHer ability to say no\nMay not be listen to it may not even have been heard but that was the only thing she\nCould do why it's like this Vanderbilt says the relationship between workers and their employers was that a master and servant\nAmerican law said that no\nOne could interfere with that relationship\nIs another employer tried to entice to serve in a way with better pay better working conditions the master could sue that would be employer\nUh working women's ability to work in other words was basically owned by her employer\nWe interfered with the woman sexually has seduced her away\nHer services to the master even a husband who proposes marriage to her could be sued by the master who she worked for\nThe master could sue under something called the port of seduction it could be invoked when a young working woman was coerced into sex\nEspecially if she became pregnant\nRaising the question of course\nWhat happens when it was the boss himself who was doing the coalition\nIn that case says ...\nThere was only one other course of action the only way that she could get any protection\nAt all was this long shot of having her father's sue on her behalf [noise]\nConsider the Eighteen fifty eight case of ... the white cops in New York Sally Dane was indentured at each fourteen to a wealthy man named why cough in her first year on the job [noise] she became pregnant with his child she'd been returned to her father's house to give birth\nShe can no longer work to support the household economy she's become a burden on his household so she has a right to recover for his loss of her services\nNot only for the wages lost during her pregnancy but also because our marriage prospects would be shocked\nIn this case the New York courts eventually sided with her father and in similar cases other courts often to the same over the next few decades\nSome of us began to change a handful of states started allowing women to have rights over themselves and to sue for their own adoption\nBut that doesn't mean all women started benefiting from the protection of the law even in those states where they could sue seduction claims were viewed with a lot of suspicion\nWas a woman telling the truth or was she simply trying to bring down an upstanding man it didn't help the Victorian attitudes about sex where gradually falling away\nThe more women were seen as sexual actors the more they were expected to deal with negative sexual experiences as\nAnd that was the prevailing attitude until the Nineteen seventies it was done that women's groups finally gave a name to this workplace behavior\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine a young lawyer named captain McKinnon wrote a groundbreaking book making the case of sexual harassment qualified as discrimination under the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act\nThat argument was accepted by the courts and as the basis for sexual harassment law as it exists today\nFinally working women had an effective legal option to tackle the problem they'd been facing\nWell since forever the changes revolutionary really\nWe now have a cause of action and I think that that means that women are freer to consent now [noise] [noise] if they choose because they also know that they can refuse if they choose\nAnd all of this goes to a greater degree of freedom for everybody in\nThe battle for equality in the workplace is hardly Overton but American women are now at least in a position where they can own their ability to work and the rights to their own sexuality\n\nMinute honest she's one of our producers opening her shoulder story was ... professor of the University of Iowa poll of wall\nNow he's from back story with the American guy\nYou can guide

ness\n... was a stark intact I Know many people find the term struck it's hard to predict contemptible Portman into but never really was both payments in his own ride and an architect to the stars one

of Spain or Albert Einstein life magazine called picks fare only slightly less important than the White House\nAnd much more fun bets Los Angeles based reporter David Weinberger Neff designed to states for Charlie Chaplin Judy Garland Groucho Marx\nYou designed a houses for all three Marx Brothers Madonna is owned enough homes and try and keep the blonde from I'm leaving like Reese Witherspoon yes she she actually honestly and we've been fact checked into the living ranch in Ohio Jeffrey\nHead is an architectural historian and the author of a book on that I checked and Reese Witherspoon does in fact owned the Libby ranch at the end of his life while as enough could have lived in a\nGrand state on the coast or a huge mentioned in the Hollywood Hills but instead he lived in a one thousand square foot concrete bubble and less believed that this simple don't was one of his greatest architectural achievements\nThe story of the bubble house begins one morning when I was standing in his bathroom shaving [noise]\nNineteen thirty four so it was probably a street racer ... net flip down and noticed a small soap bubbles that formed and I think he reached out and touch the bottle held firm against his finger to\nThat was the moment the idea struck him\nHe could build with air he can build bubble houses and therefore wanted to build them by the thousands\nNear the end of the second World War architects were anticipating the postwar housing shortage and working on various solutions\nA larger view and want it to create a solution and to me than in for housing worldwide and\nJeffrey ... book about NASA is titled known nails no lumber because the bubble houses and you did know nails and lumber head says that ... never saw the bubble houses as a way to make money you sell them as a social responsibility a way to provide low cost housing for people\nHe really didn't make money from it and in fact I spent a great deal of money\nMoney from his other architectural practice and put it into the bubble houses\nPlus Neff was already rich remember he was building mansions for the Hollywood elite\nAnd his grandfather was Andrew McNally the car toggle for who created Rand McNally publishing\nDuring this idea of a dome shaped dwelling was not entirely new indigenous cultures in the Americas at certainly explored that territory even during this lifetime another guy Buckminster Fuller was creating his own circular solution to the housing shortage the geo desk dome\nYeah and I think there's a misunderstanding people you know look at the by the house and they think oh this is a variation on bucket for and it's it's really not it's it's more of a variation on a a a form of hearing in nature that someone has\nAdopted for human scale human years\nWhat was the original about ness design was the way the bubble houses were built now invented a new method of construction he cold air for years how it worked first a big slap\nGiant balloon in the shape of half a grapefruit with a flat side down this balloon was tied down to the foundation even deal hooks\nSo once the balloon was tied down it was inflated with a through an inland bells and it took all of five minutes later after the balloon was inflated that was coated in a bind powder in this this would happen before the gun I process uh yes gun ...\nMinutes of talking about the magical substance that is gun I were maybe you prefer the generic term Sean green\nYeah to the gun I was shot out of us in that gun and the gun had two houses that came together at a novel one of the novel had water and the other was dry some in the in the water in the mix\nCame together under high pressure to form the gun night when\nThe gun I tried it was more than twice as strong as regular concrete Neff\nLove this stuff once the balloon was coated in gun I'd a layer of wire mesh was placed over that then a second layer of gun I was sprayed on and bam that's it two men with a balloon and a gun machine could turn to bare patch of soil into a bubble house in less than forty\nEight hours an after the gun I tried the balloon was deflated and pulled out to the front door who can be used again on the next house\nAnd they claim that the bubble houses were more fireproof more earthquake proof and even more bomb proof than any traditional structure\nAnd that was so confident and has a design that he would often invite people to bash the walls of the bubble was the backside of an axe was\nAt the back so damn for some reason they use the ... I don't know what the reasoning was but I've seen an all the photos they're using the backside of the X. men like the best about the bubble houses though was that they were incredibly cheap\nAfter ... fine tune the reform process he went in search of a client someone with money would hire him to build more bubble houses and he found one the federal government\nBut first of all the houses were\nDone during the war to create a quick housing for government workers\nWorld War two it escalated and the U.S needed homes for military workers some ... convinced the government to build an experimental bubble house community in a forest in Falls Church Virginia\nTo remove him forty one Neff began construction on the twelve bubble houses in Falls Church that would eventually be nicknamed big we village\nThere was no lighting of any kind on the street and we arrived in the daytime but it was still quite dark because they were so many trees\nKathy miles grew up in one of the falls church bubble houses when she was five years old her dad who worked for the military drove the family into the forest to show them their new house he hadn't told his wife and two daughters that they would be living in a village of bubbles in the woods it was dark and damp and isolated\nAnd I can remember coming up the street and there was a clear area with still many trees and very little grass if any and there were flags stones and there was this\nHouse it didn't look like a house to me at that time that there was something rising up from the ground and it was white and large and it had to large lumps and they were held together in the middle with a smokestack\nAnd of course I was with my parents and um I don't remember what they were telling me but I'm sure it was something\nThat we were going to live in this new kind of house\nDo you remember what your mother's reaction was when she first saw\nHer over reaction was to stay calm and carry on a I think she was trying\nSo to come to something that looked like this I think she was truly horrified\nThe falls church community consisted of two single bubble houses and ten double bubble houses jumping lived in one of the double bubbles ...\nThe double bubbles were made by connecting to smaller bubbles with a rectangular cinderblock structure that how's the kitchen in the bathroom\nBecause he says that growing up in ... village was incredibly isolated\nAnd it made her stand out\nOne time when she was in first grade\nI set out to draw a picture of my house and of course we colored it and I couldn't color it because\nI kept insisting there were no white crayons and\nSo when the teacher looked at it she kept saint ex tried to explain to me that I was supposed to draw the house I Lived in and I kept saying I Do live in this house so\nFinally I felt that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to and she clearly had no idea what I was doing and of course when we passed all the houses around to our friends to look at the pictures the other children\nMade fun of it\nSo it was pretty daunting as a as an introduction to first grade for me\nRight no matter how great it was [laughter] or I mean I'm not talking about ironically great but you know like what if it was great we none of us would buy into it and I think that was part of his situation you know he wasn't like a hipster he he wasn't an unknown crazy\nYou made giant houses for rich people\nAnd yet that's never stopped believing in the bubble house he continued to make variations on it designing bubbles with straighter sides and flatter roofs ones with big holes cut out of the side\nEven at the end of his life long after it was clear that the bubble house had no future he saw as one of his greatest architectural achievements he believed in it so strongly that he spent the end of his life living in a bubble house in fact he lived in the same house he wrote an outlet and\nNow I don't want to play the bubble house off as just some failed\nIdea I think it should

then he dug a hole in the dead of night\n[noise] a year later stub Newell was standing my whole in the ground with a lump in his throat a day after orchestrating the incredible discovery of a biblical

hand over a giant fest in swirling it away for George Hall in his secret cabal of investors and then they took the job\nBut so does the risk\nEach town had its own experts its professors it's lectures of note could all take a crack\nAt the giant but most bought it the giant genesis and the whole thing [noise] some didn't and they said it was a statue but an ancient statue\nFrom some lost civilization which would have been a giant discovery if not a petrified one [noise] but every now and then\nSomeone would call it when it was just a giants game but George Hall and his investors managed to stay a step ahead moving on to another city before people caught on in demand and the answers and they would have to own up to reality\nThere was one person who didn't care at all whether it was real P. T. Barnum knew a good show and he saw one and he made them an offer he wouldn't be in sixty thousand dollars to rent the giant for three months\nAnd this was a good deal\nThat's about ... million of today's dollars\nIn George Hall it only spent the equivalent of thirty grand to make is petrified marvel their tour it was still doing\nWell but not that well\nThey never make the kind of money in Fremont [noise]\nThey didn't have Barnes promotional genius and most importantly they didn't have as a mammoth museum in downtown Manhattan [noise]\nBut they didn't take the offer\nBecause Manhattan was the problem they had managed to make a small fortune often outrageous fake [noise]\nBut people were starting to poke holes in the story letting\nLittle drops of doubts in three months in the spotlight and the biggest city in the world\nThe whole thing was bound to get washed away [noise]\nAnd Barnum said fine and then he made his own giant [noise]\nNo one can figure out exactly how he did it maybe someone made a plaster cast in the dead of night maybe someone had been surreptitiously making elaborate sketches at every stop on the tour [noise]\nBut in the fall of Eighteen sixty nine [noise] an exact replica of the card of giant\nWent on display and Barnum Museum [noise]\nAnd of course he claimed it was the real thing [noise]\nThe owners of the real big giant were outraged\nThey threatened to sue environments and bring it on you bring your giant into court\nAnd I'll bring mine and we'll ask a judge to decide which one is really a petrified person\nGeorgia all knew he was ...\nHe signed a book deal and then he admitted the whole thing [noise]\nAnd people still came to see the giant for a while\nIt may not have been a real magical mythical creature\nBut it was still pretty cool [noise]\nIt wasn't a real giant but it was a giant celebrity\nIn George ... took his money and he sold some books [noise]\nAll these different techniques than than than ... as a lawyer with ... what he called false registration colors within the lines of the the rocks would wind up with the color behind it and then he said that was to give you a speech in\nWhich he knew all about because he grew up in New Mexico\nHe grew up in that kind of thing he played in the rocks in ... I'm sure all that influenced his take on on the debt is when he did the cartoon [noise]\nAnd this is how Murray snow will become a hero to lay out designers\nRemember his work is not supposed to detract from the characters I mean and the layoffs are supposed to support the animation and make it stand out and he does that brilliantly but he also developed a unique unrecognizable style I mean it's almost like he built a stage for a show but the stages winking at the audience\nSo I studied animation at Cal arts and so we'd be watching a cartoon like duck Dodgers and the twenty fourth and a half century\nAnd we would burst out laughing because daffy duck it landed on planning an ax and Marie said drawn the clouds in the trees in the shape the giant exits\nI'll just and if we follow those planets\nOut why\nAs noble as coming into his own he's starting to get co director credit on some of the films but Doug Jones is still\nReaping most with the claim\nTop pulse and one of them are he says ... says that this became a point of tension between them in the sixties when they were working at a gym\nThere was a working relationship\nAnd it can became more and more strained as shark\nBecame more and more successful especially in the sixties and then that that came to a head when they made on the line\nThat on the line with an adaptation of a children's book and\nIt was about a a dog that falls in love with a line\nAnd it's a story on their romance Chuck Jones with the director on the short but he was having trouble figuring out how to adapt it to the executives Montgomery says well\nIf if you don't fall short I can make this work for you [noise]\nIt's so charmed brought this stuff in through it down on his desk and stomped out and reach wouldn't show him when he was working on\nOnce upon a time there was this since ...\nIn love with it don't [noise]\nYou're giving the hobby and the U.S can do that and to\nPut the dog was going to be interested [noise]\n...\nWild and I'm Kevin ...\nNever seemed to have anything on his mind at all\nIt's probably the most personal of all races films because it's really just him on the screen as pure graphics there's no\nClassic characters as you might might think of them is just tossed lines is purely abstract um but really beautiful\nThe film is is this pure a distillation of Murray says work and he's telling a story creating emotions and humor with just basic shapes and colors but Chuck Jones still got director credit\nAnd of course they won the Oscar\nBut he said that that sure didn't ever think came\nAnd Todd says that even though everyone knew was Murray suicide film\nMurray's wasn't invited to the Oscars so Chuck Jones unreasonable kept working together they worked on how the Grinch stole Christmas and a bunch of other Dr seuss adaptations but they fell out of touch for about Twenty years until the early Nineteen nineties when Warner Brothers reunited them to make cartoons at play before feature films\nThey hired a bunch of young artists who just graduated from Cal arts and one of them was Scott Morris\nMorris no voice number where do you where do I know that from I was like oh it's because it was one of the names that preceded directed by Charles M Jones and all of the cartoons that I grew up watching every day of my life\nWasn't the first lessons that Scott learned was that Murray's is fantastic backgrounds were not just invented out of thin air Murray's did a ton of research everything he exaggerated was based on something in the real world\nYou'd get an assignment like um oh you know Bugs Bunny is gonna be stuck on a desert island or are stuck on the jungle Ireland so there should be palm trees and should be able to stop and say okay great\nAnd I come back with a ... with the with the drawing and he'd be like what does this and it might have their palm trees and he's like those are stuck as were what were you looking at and it's like well there's a poetry or it out the window is like that's a ... you gotta learn your trees\nBut Murray's wasn't really that graph after work you talk to these twenty two year old animators like he was just one of the guys\nHe'd be life with school or just with the baseball game let's go do this other thing you know we should go to a museum pretty soon you realize he's more like your grandpa who is just a really cool guy to hang out with\nSo Scott Morris Mr above artist became known as the noble boys and Marie's pushed them to develop their own style but his sensibility really seeped into their work\nLike Scott is that Pixar now which is the home of three D. animation which we think is the complete opposite of you know the flat landscapes of loony tunes but you can really see Murray says influence on the Pixar Films if you look for it like um the film I\nThink about that house carried by a massive amount of balloons and lands on the very edge of a cliff foreign ... cute little robot is skirting around these big menacing powers of garbage\nYou know those are layout that make you smile that's that's classic Murray's [noise]\nIn May of two thousand one the noble boys were reunited when last time we\nAll got the call them Maurice he was in hospice basically at home it was just natural causes that he that he was dying of and he was pretty sure you know everybody's pretty sure that that night was going to\nMaybe be the last night so we all came over and hung out with him and Chuck Jones did call that night I remember being in the room with Maurice in somebody brought him photos of trucks on the phone and more says like okay I'll I'll talk to them and we all knew for a fact they haven't really talked for months if not a couple of years at that point\nAnd I just heard Maurice his side of the conversation but you know you could definitely tell that they were ah they put everything behind them in their friends you know and it was nice and I again I don't know exactly what Chuck sat on the other end of that line but um it was a very sweet moment to be able to see that\nUm and know that people could go through a lot together life and still\nHave respect for each other you know up to the last minute and kind of celebrate what they had created together\nTo some extent Murray southern noble boys as real legacy he was proud of the fact that they had blossomed into well rounded artist\nIf Maurice could leave behind this idea in other people to do their own thing\nWas a beautiful beautiful background [noise]\nI actually met ... double oh yeah yeah um I I went to Cal arts and I came in our class I was like a Monday Night and I happen to have gone to the opera the day before and you know the weekend and I was thinking about how often those guys made fun of opera and their cartoons\nBut I've been\nTo the pool widow or [noise]\nAnd I asked him you know did you guys actually go to the opera regularly or were you just kind of making fun but it just sort of you know highfalutin cultural institution\nAnd he asked me what operate did you see [laughter] and I said ... and he said uh the uh like a death is beautiful\nAnd none of the man who knew a good death when he

PR act [noise] [noise]\nI don't get blown away by um the movie stars because I've seen them over their head down\nLike I thought he had to wait a this is of course not as bad as it is for a person who restarted there [noise]\nOkay so kept up with the Internet and they have all kinds of applications and I could spend the next hour talking about all the different applications but since I don't want to do at the ... one of the application Stuart Little story and it's a this one's a few years ago slashed off which is a very popular website for nerd\nPut up with this fall and their site asking which is the best computer science graduate school in the United states\nNow do you think about it for a second this is a really dangerous question to ask over the Internet because as soon as the pole went up students at Carnegie Mellon wrote a program that voted for Carnegie Mellon millions and millions and\nThe next day through it ends at MIT rose their own programs and a few days later the pool has to be taken down because both the I mean I might have more than six billion votes [noise]\nAnd every other school had less than a thousand so I guess [noise]\nIf you think about it the poll did exactly what it was supposed to do [noise]\nBut in general we simply cannot trust the results of an online focus anybody could just write a program to vote for their favorite option\nNow one possible solution to that if the capture to make sure that only humans can vote\nOkay so kept us can can be used to improve what post another application of captures isn't free email services you've probably this is probably were most do we have seen kept us so there's a lot of companies that offer free email a Google Microsoft Yahoo it's better and up until a few years ago there were all suffering from a very specific type of attack\nAnd it was people who wrote programs to obtain millions of email accounts every day and the people who wrote these programs were ... so here's the thing if you're a spammer and you want to send spam from the Yahoo account you want your spouse to come from some account at Yahoo dot com\nYou run into the problem but each Yahoo email account only allows you to spend like a hundred messages today so if you're a spammer and you want to spend a hundred million messages per day to the whole world you have to obtain millions of ... ... email accounts from which you can spend the spam okay so this is why spammer spoke program still paying millions of accounting\nI'm doing just and and the solution to this\nAnd the pain for email accounts okay so that's what the capture so therefore when general kept us are used to stop spammer from doing bad things on the Internet\nNow of course the cameras on their side started coming up with all kinds of dirty half to get around that captures that are being used in practice let me show you one of them\nAre just we called them capture sweatshops so spam companies have actually started hiring humans whose sole job is just kept us all day long\nMaybe it's just people who sit there typing captures all day long for spam company uh this is happening this is usually happening in other countries where the minimum wage is a lot lower\nBut it's happening um but there's at least two consolation first\nIt's at least costing them some\nSo whereas before I ... get millions and millions of email accounts for free now they have to pay a fraction of a ... so they can get that many second if you think about it captures that actually generating jobs and underdeveloped countries [noise]\nUh okay so this is what some a spam company so I started doing let me tell you an even dirtier hack and this is what some pornography company so I started doing so in case you didn't know that there's pornography on the Web\nAnd pornography companies would also like to send back so let me show you\nOne trick that they're doing okay so um imagine this pornography company would like to spend ... from Yahoo account okay so they they need to obtain millions of Yahoo accounts from which they can spend spans what they do is they write a program that fill out the entire registration form of Yahoo\nNow whenever this program gets to the capture Programme can't read it so what it does is a copy is to capture to the foreign page\nNow back in the ... there's a lot of people looking at pornography\nAnd suddenly one of them get screened saying hey if you want to see the next pornographic image of pornographic video you gotta types the word that's in the buffalo\nAnd you know what people do they take the word as fast as possible [noise]\nAnd by typing if they are effectively solving the capture for the foreign company that is they are effectively getting an email account with a foreign company can later used to spend you\nI keep telling people pornographers they're very smart people\nOkay so now let me let me show you one more thing about capital so the idea of a capture is much more general must have you have seen uh the same type of capture the ... characters but the idea is a lot more general the idea is just it's just a test\nThat we're trying to test whether the user is actually a human and not some sort of computer program okay so let me show you some different examples of captures that people have started coming up with a and I'm just going to show them to just because I I find them pretty funny so these are these are also going to this all supposed to be\nTested that humans can easily do but the computers cannot you have to do\nOkay so let me show you I'm One of them to start but let me show you one on one of them that started coming up in all kinds of Russian fight this we're going to call the Russian capture this is what you have to do [noise]\n\nIt's funny the things that in Russia are the things that anybody could just off limits\nOr this actually happens to be a pretty back after this is not a very good for the computers can actually do this all the limit but but it's funny to think that\nTo see that they think that anybody could just all the limit but this is the Russian capture you have to let me let me show you one that started coming up and all kinds of Indian sites we're going to call it the Indian capture\nYou have to analyze the circuit\nThis is I'm not even I'm not even making this up for this started coming um again it's interesting to see that in India they think anybody could just analyze the circuit a but\nOf course again this is a pretty Capra capture computers can actually do this so well now let me put this in contract so in ...\nIn the out of the capture you have to want to like the circuit let me show you the capture that started coming up and all kinds of\nUs based blogs were going to call this the American capture\n\nAgain this is a pretty crappy capture because computers can actually add [noise]\nSo let me tell you what I actually want to tell you about in the ... the first little part I just needed to introduce you to the concept of a cap so now I'm going to tell you what I really want to talk about which is this newer project called recapture we started working on just about two years ago um\nAnd this is sort of the future of capturing but let me tell you and and this came from a so this new project came from\nOne number it turns out\nThat approximately two hundred million kept just our type every day by people around the world just quickly characters about two hundred million\nWords are type every day by people around the world\nNow when I first heard this number was proud of myself I thought look at the impact on my research has had\nA but then I started feeling bad so here's the thing each time you type one of these annoying kept just essentially you're wasting ten seconds of your time\nAnd if you multiply that by two hundred million you get the humanity as a whole is within five hundred thousand hours every day typing these annoying after\nA yeah so I [noise]\nSo I started feeling bad a ... and then I started thinking\nWell of course we can't just get rid of captures because the security of the Web sort of depends on them but then I started thinking is there any way new and she can use this effort for something that's good for humanity here's the thing\nDoing those ten seconds while you're typing a capture your brain is doing something amazing your brain is doing something that computers can not yet to do\nSo is there a way in which you can use those ten seconds for something that's good for humanity another way of putting it is is there some humongous problem that we can not yet get computers to solve\nBut somehow we can split into tiny ten seconds chunks pushed that each time somebody types of capture the actually building a little bit of this problem\nAnd the answer to that is yes and this is what we're doing now so what you may not know is that nowadays when you type of ... not only are you a ... herself as a human but in addition you're helping digitize books\nOkay so the idea of the following there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books um the Internet archive half one Google has one now Amazon with a Kindle half when they're\nThey're trying to digitize books and basically what they're doing if they're taking all books books that were in before the computer age and scanning them so that they can be an electronic format base and the way the book ditched the station works as follows you start with an old book\nPhysical book and then you scan is now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book and this is literally what's getting a book means it's the way they do it if they take a digital photograph every page of the book\nThe next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher once you've you've taken all these photographs with every page of the book the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in the photograph that so that you can search through\nThe the textbook okay so the computer program needs to look at these photographs\nWith text in them and it needs to be able to decipher them that don't you think you can also called owes the are for optical character recognition program but those are not the problem with most ER is that it doesn't always work very well especially for older books where the income faded\nThe computer can recognize a lot of the character so for example\nIn the age in the over there you see that it has lost its bridge because it's the greatest thing has the greatest so the computer can recognize me or the character so for example in this particular scan which is actually a pretty high quality scan for something to say if you try to get the computer to recognize the characters in the run OC are on this this is what you got\nIt was a moratorium days for the bread men people a test of their devotion and the method of schooling them in the proper ritual ... the strategic withholding

Nathan ...\nHere's Nathan will [noise]\nRecently\nI've visited Beloit, Wisconsin and I was there to honor a great twentieth century explore Roy Chapman Andrews\nDuring his time at the American museum of natural history Andrews let a range of expeditions to uncharted regions like here in the Gobi Desert he was quite a figure he was later it said the basis of the Indiana Jones character\nAnd when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin I gave a public lecture to group of middle school students\nAnd I'm here to tell you if there's anything more intimidating and talking here it's had there'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand twelve year olds for forty five minute lecture\nOr don't try that one I'm at the end of the lecture they after a number of questions but there was one that's really stuck with me since then there was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question\nWhere should we explore I think there's a sense that many of us have the great age of exploration on earth is over there for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest ocean some order to find something significant to explore what\nDoes that really the case and they're really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth\nSort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology this isn't explores the unseen world Martin is by rank\nSome firing set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease what he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters\nAnd he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known a bacteria at the time\nHe came up with a name for his mystery age and he called it\nThe virus a mountain for poison and in sort of uncovering viruses firing fairly open\nThis entire new world for us we now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information all other forms of life combined\nObviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world things like the eradication of smallpox uh the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus\nAnd Byron discovery this was not something that occurred five hundred years ago a little it was a little over a hundred years ago the firing discovered viruses so basically we had automobiles but we were unaware of the forms of life and make up most of the genetic information on our planet\nWe now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world\nThings like deep sequencing which allow us to do much more than just sort of skimmed the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species but to look at entire met a genomes\nCommunities have teeming microorganisms in on around us into document all of the genetic information in these species we can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between a reconciliation we now do this on a regular basis to identify\nA the causes of outbreaks that are sort of unclear exactly what causes them\nAnd just to give you a sense of how this works or imagined that we took a nasal swab from every single one of the un says something we commonly due to look for respiratory viruses like influenza\nThe first thing that we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information\nAnd if we started looking into that genetic information we see a number of usual suspects out there of course a lot of human genetic information but also bacterial and viral information mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose but we also see something very very surprising as we started to look at this information\nIn your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before new plant animal fungus virus or bacteria basically we have no clue what this is and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data\nFew of us have actually been done to call this information biological dark matter we know it's not anything that we've seen before it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continents\nRate within our own genetic information and there's a lot of it if you think twenty percent of genetic information your nose is a lot\nOf biological dark matter if we looked at your gut up to forty or fifty percent of that information is biological dark matter and even in the relatively sterile blood around one to two percent of the information is dark matter can't be classified can't be type dramatic with anything that we've seen before\nAt first we thought that perhaps this was artifact right these deep sequencing tools are relatively new but as they become more and more accurate we've determined that this information is a form of life or at least some of it as a form of life\nAnd while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter really only in their infancy there's a very very exciting\nPossibility that exist buried in this life are signatures in this genetic information are signatures of as of yet on identified life that actually explores\nThe strings of aids T season jeez\nWe may uncover a completely new class of life\nLike firing full fundamentally changed the way that we think about the nature of biology the perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we don't unfamiliar with or perhaps create a new tool and molecular biology I'm pleased to announce that along with\nColleagues at Stanford and Cal Tech can UCF\nWe're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life\nA little over a hundred years ago people were unaware of viruses the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet a hundred years from now people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses\nIt's true we may have charged at all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on earth ... times provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin\nAnd I think if we phrase that lesson it's something like this don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore their unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered\n\nThat was Nathan wolf recorded it had
