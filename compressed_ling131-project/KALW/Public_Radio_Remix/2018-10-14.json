San Francisco Ninety One point seven to ... you know\n[noise] you're listening to public radio removed\nFrom your own online at ... dot org ... someone\nTo get on public radio station\nIncluding KLW not even going to\nThe oldest from radio station and the first question was [noise]\nYou're listening to imaginary world show about how we create them and why we bend our disbelief\nAmerican [noise] so I'm going to start somewhere today that it's very deeply rooted in the real world New York city real estate\nLiving in the city is all about being tempted by what you can't have [noise]\nAnd you can't resist the temptation\nYou have to just enjoy the I can\nWhich is why I Love reading the website Kurt\nIt's basically real estate foreign\nThey bring you inside those fifty million dollar condos that have a mount Olympus view Central Park\nI mean bonkers is one of ... favorite words and because we're a blog we can call it like we see it we can say this is ridiculous this is not this is mind boggling\nThat's ... ... senior editor for the New York office\nNow one of my favorite running jokes on current is the way that they make fun of scaly scaly is architectural slang the little people show up in building proposals to give it a sense of scale hence the nickname scaly\nWay back in the day when new buildings were drawn by hand there is an artful enough to these people now things are digital you can go on these websites where they sell like big packages upscale is that you can buy and then just sort of cut and paste them anywhere which leads to all sorts of awkwardness\nOne year for Valentine's Day one of our sights\nHighlighted the most ... for example\nAnd I do remember seeing some skills making out sex and the two steamy sultry scaly loving architectural rendering I don't even know what that is only in the morning of a park yeah and if you guys are hard to come out of them are you are you out of the art I'm pretty hit ... where I thought that we did\nOr there was one building proposal where the scale these were just so a loop the bloggers that curbed wrote dialogue captions for them\nThe woman says oh the galleries were wonderful today weren't they Adrian\nThe manner place shut up and they tell you know I hate it when you talk in the lobby\n... out of a tall window you've become coal to me to tell you can see that in the LA ovens subs zeroes individual private storage and floor to ceiling windows don't bring you happiness my whole belief system is in doubt and you're right the views are spectacular\n... thought she'd seen it all and then she came across an ad campaign for these condos on ... street which is an area called Hudson Square it's right on the Hudson River and the west side of Manhattan sort of sandwiched between\nThe west village and try back\nAnd the scale these were not generic\nThere are distinct customs shot characters a box or the big bushy beard tattoos leave\nBut Nineteen twenties gym clothes\nThere was an astronomer who seemed to hail from the age of Benjamin Franklin\nAnd there was an Asian woman was wearing kind of an aristocratic French wig and 'course it but sort of a punk rock attitudes\nAre headline for our first posted that it was Fifteen Renwick seems to be catering to steam punk millionaires\nAnd then to use one of ... words things got even more bonkers pictures of these characters started appearing around the city at first she thought the ads for like ... Chanel number five\nIn these ads where it's just them in the building isn't even pictured which is quite unusual normally scaly is there because it gives a sense of scale to the building but ... to put a character by itself with no picture of the building\nWhich is sort of like yeah now now these people are stand in for the architecture that's kind of interesting and weird and and unusual\nThe models started showing up in character in costume at events to alert people to buy these condos and then there's the picture of the building itself\nThe real Renwick street is very short narrow but in the architectural rendering these very modern looking condos are perched along an Eighteenth century can now with like clippers ships and\nPeople wearing you know colonial garb and I just learned as recently the official term like the official architectural term for the rendering them a new building is called the hero shot like the building as a superhero that you're looking up at\nAnd in the case of the hero of Fifteen Renwick you've got a blimp just casually flooding by tall ships in their masks that appear to be about as tall as the building\nAnd I love also that um the here in is still in there with the neon sign so at least maybe that's the time traveling Porto that they use to get to never never New Amsterdam [laughter] exactly [noise]\nNow I mentioned on the spot gas that I Love New York history I always see layers of the past around me like I actually happen to know that Hudson Square back in the sixteen hundreds was farmland that was owned by the Roosevelt the Roosevelt the ancestors of Franklin Eleanor in the door\nSo I became obsessed with his ad campaign particularly because I'm not the target audience I don't have a couple of million to spend on a condo so who came up with what were they thinking or smoking we\nAre adamantly opposed to the scale is that you're describing we never put people in ... because we think that people don't necessarily identify with the people and you can always you know they never look good\nSo that's where Amy Franco was coming from before she started working on this campaign for her company if studio but then the team started doing some research in the area and they were impressed by how long it's been a hub of craftsmanship\nAnd and really the characters tells a story of the creative class people these creative iconoclast that lived there then and have lived there for all the time and live there even now\nOf course in the last two decades areas\nBut New York also has a very wealthy creative class that can afford to buy their\nAnd might find this out campaign really fun\nJennifer Connelly John Slattery Daniel Radcliffe Sophia ... involved live there\nAnd it's not just Hollywood people you know in the west village got any legal with Calvin Klein Julie inch novel and so how there's David Byrne leash a keys or Anderson Taylor Swift when she moved to New York was looking to buy a condo in Hudson swear it but she went with tried decade\nOr so I read on curbed [noise] but these characters weren't selling the idea of a super successful creative class\nThey're each created to personify a different feature of the building\nSo for example the whole team together decided that rather than your basic gym\nThey wanted to offer something that was more distinctive so they decided to put a boxing gym and so therefore we have a boxer as one of the characters um one of the apartment has a beautiful terrorists that overlooks you know the west side so we put an astronomer and to tell that story so that when\nI went to I Want to read like the ... the back story you know I Want to hear about the astronomer and his two hundred years in Manhattan [laughter] right exactly\nAnd those Eighteen century French wigs and close we're not totally random according to a scene as a beta project manager\nNew Yorkers had being on a world the city had influence from the French and then we did the research we did see that you know American ... at the higher aristocratic level did have that French influence in it as well\nDid you look at steam punk as well 'cause there seems to be in terms of contemporary\nRe did not look at steam punk we weren't even considering the vocabulary of that word at all\nNeither was Kevin to me so [laughter] do you in lakes and with Israel was a\nKevin co founded the company march which designed these rendering\nHe usually renders more you know normal non fantastic building so he was totally like to work on this project and by the way their officers right below the Manhattan Bridge so you'll hear the train rumbling above us we're leaning over his computer looking at all the different versions of the hero shot which didn't make it\nThere was the colonial one and there was one that felt a little bit more like gangs of New York it was it was a little more like war fee and a gray and and then like barrels and\nBoats and yeah like I can imagine the boxer character would do very well in the gangs of New York area but ah I don't know about the astronomer I think you'd get a telescopes to\n... you know it wouldn't have been as good for him or any anybody Russia's really one probably the only one that could have held his own\nI was surprised that even consider the gangs of New York background I mean the production design on that Martin Scorsese movie was awesome but the five points was still a dangerous slum and and this was the other runner up\nUm you should feel free to pick them up if you want them and I said like what\nShe said I like all those paintings that at Warner gave us I I I don't need any more art mom\nThere's also the you know the big fan you're has a box of Christmas ornament [noise]\nYou less my head in Stewart's garage [noise]\nAnd I instantly have these fantasies of Stuart channeling all his rage against my mother into the clay bust of me as an Eighteen year old you know like smashing into smithereens with uh nine iron ore\nSliding off his roof and watching it smashed on the sidewalk covering it with a female dog hormone and putting it out on the sidewalk and [noise]\nAnyway I I figure\nThat's it I mean that's the good news\nI don't have to worry about their had any more except\nMy stepfather didn't destroy it in fact thinking he was doing me a favor\nOne day he drives it in his car over to my dad's house somebody there so I get this call late one night I was a booth and say hey Jay it's dad\nI'm Stuart came by with your head earlier today\nAnd uh we're wondering when you're going to combine pick it up [noise]\nAnd of course at this point I'm thinking like that is like my monkey paw it's like\nHead that won't go away\nAnd I I tell them when I sit down and you know I got a lot of work right now I Can't just drop everything and go up and pick up the head you know can you just\nHold onto it for a while\nAnd he says you know um [noise]\nYour stepmother and I are really trying to reduce clutter in our\nI think we both really appreciate it if you've got as soon as possible [noise]\nThis rejection of the head\nHurts me more than any of the other had rejections more than my wife's carpets golfing at the mirror idea of taking home where my my wife leaving it in her ex husband's garage or my mother leaving at her ex husband's garage because\nMy father left us when when I was ten and as a result his approval has always been something that I desired more than anyone else's and\nBecause it's been so elusive and so\nThis really sticks with me and I say dad\nThis is gonna sound completely ridiculous but it hurts my feelings that you don't want my head [noise]\nAnd I think for second this is great we reached this whole new level of father son understanding and then he says\nThere's a painting of me in the downstairs closet that nobody wants [noise]\nAnd I know immediately the painting he's talking about it\nIt's a portrait that my grandmother had made of him when he was Twenty years old [noise]\nShe hadn't hanging over her fireplace until she died\nAnd uh and I don't want it you know\nSo it seems like we've reached the standoff right where\nNeither one of us who wants to take each other's crappy are so am\nI say look to do whatever you want with it OK throw it away I Can't deal with it and I and I hang up or go to sleep and I have a very fit full night's sleep tossing attorney and I wake up the next morning and I think you know I'm going to go get that had and I [noise]\nI mean I drive to my dad's and get it in the in my my rationale is\nIf somebody's just throw this thing a way it should be me and um\nSo I get up there by the time I get up there my dad's already put it in\nHis basement and um to get into the basement and my dad's house there's this little door the back of the house you have to crouch down to kind of gets through the door and I would do that and go in there and I'm In the basement and there's the head staring smuggle a hit the water heater and I\nI go over and I and I pick it up and it's kind of Stephen heavier than I remember it's like it gets a gravity from Jupiter or something it's\nReally really weighs a lot I mean I'm kind of caring across the base hunch down to get back through that little door in part of my spine just goes again it's just like my back just said screw it I hate you die\nAnd I stagger out of this door and into the into the sunlight blinded by pain and smack my head and like my actual head on the tree branches\nAnd I drop and drop that had [noise]\nAnd for a moment I think thank God I'm Free it's over\nBut then I looked down and they had is perfectly intact\nLike I don't know it's made of kryptonite or something [noise]\nStaring up at me with that smirk it's just like ... it's like saying to me you're rule dude [noise]\nSo I pick it up and I put it in the car and my first impulse is to go straight to the nearest dumpster order a garbage can and\nThrow it away but but no I I there's just something about imagined the heads high older to these dirty diapers and coffee filters and banana peels I mean it's just kind of still me as an Eighteen year old I got to figure out what to do with it so I take it home and I and I walk in the house and they put it on the kitchen counter and I hear this low under league growling\nWhoa and look down on my dog Walter is [noise]\nBlaring at the head all the hair on his back standing on man [noise]\nI've never heard a noise like this I mean it's like it's like that scene in the ... when the animals go crazy on the whole childhood\nAnd then my wife walks and she goes hey you know\nI run throwing it away I guess it was okay walks out [noise]\nWanted to say no don't do that in a way that the that the label family trigger that's a part of your history I Am so desperate for one person to like my head which is crazy because\nSo I I call my mom I figure if I can figure out why they had was made in the first place\nI can figure out what to do with it now so I called my mom and I ask her\nAnd she says well you were leaving home and I was surprised at how much that upset me\nAnd you know after dad left you were you were my anger you you were the only person I could count on and um I thought that maybe having a piece of you would would help me get through that time and and it did\nA end at some point I just didn't need it anymore\nAnd then she adds it's it's very heavy [noise]\nSo what I got from this is that\nThe head of the product of a really difficult time in my family's life and my mother basically dealt with my father leaving by creating a cult of personality with with me as a personality and her as a cult\nAnd finally she been able to leave which is a good thing right I mean ... are very hard to leave and\nAnd my wife and my dad had never been part of the cold which is also a really good thing although\nTo be honest I Wish my dad had done\nSpent a couple of years of the ... [noise]\n\nI don't think I really understood they had fully though until a few months after that call when I um when our daughter Cleo was born and\nWhen I held her that I started my own cults basically\nIt was happening to me I mean I'm she'd\nLoosely and recklessly loved this individual for no other reason than than that she was alive\nAnd as for the head\nI found a place for it in my garage between some fertilizer and some are a bag of dead batteries\nAre I think I've finally come to accept my place in a long chain of children destined to hold onto crappy are commissioned by their parents [noise]\nClear it's going to have it a lot easier though I'm we're going to keep her head digital\n\nA writer and producer on the comedy central shrimp season but you may have random in print in the New Yorker style rolling\nStone his first novel the channel to see a picture of Jay with gates had to go to our website the Martha ... personally I think that is kind of things would be tempted to buy it at a garage sale by the way I asked change mother if I could intervene earlier about the head and she declined\nShe said letting it go still made her feel guilty even down there can listen to a hundred other stories amount and\nLearn more about the knock that Oregon last [noise]\n\nThis is public radio re mix [noise]\nHe doesn't know if he'll be allowed to sponsor his mother she's still in Somalia\nYou sound a lot about that clean wonderful peaceful land he imagined and the ways it has\nHasn't lined up with life as a black Muslim immigrants\nHe's written a book about it it's title call me American\nI'm an immigrant but I'm an immigrant lovers America I came to America to be part of\nOn under some\nMost importantly to be an American\nBlue Note\nYou know for a lot of 'em have to put it straight on the Mike\nA little something wonderful about this little thing right has it been around for a long\nTime they've become rather ... contractions\nYou're listening to your ex remarried we'll put a strain on the microphone you [noise]\n\n[noise] this is transistor sites series from our\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is totally cerebral part of transistor from PR acts supported by the Sloan Foundation I'm Dr Wendy's\n[noise]\nWho is more excited the first day of class the students or the teacher\nWho do you think you get excited cutting the class [laughter] I get excited coming to class\nI was a freshman at UC Berkeley and it was taking a class that first semester my freshman year it was a freshman honor seminar and so there are only about Fifteen students in the class and the class what's called the brain and its potential and it was taught by an amazing instructor my name is Marion diamond\nI've been painting here for many decades\n[laughter] because I Love to\nAll about the brain in fact that very first day I'll never forget she was standing in front of the classroom and um\nFirst of all she looked like a Hollywood movie star she had this blonde grew fond hairdo should very tall very beautiful woman with a white lab coat over a beautiful skirt and and blouse and in front of her on the table was a flowery ...\nBox now you know what the most complex massive protests last on this earth is what do you think it with me\nShe opened not ... very dramatically and she pulled out a real preserved human brain\nBrain sure without a doubt get anybody tell me anything more complex than the human brain for a little\nFreshman at UC Berkeley who had never seen a human brain before\nWas one of the most memorable moments of my entire college career\nI Want you to appreciate what you carry on the top of your head\nBecause this mass only weighs three pounds and yet it has the capacity to conceive of a universe of billion light years of cry isn't that phenomenal\nIt really is the most complex structure known to mankind it underlies our creativity and our personalities and not only that but it can grow and change in response to the environment and it is a phenomenon that\nHouse and the human body they have a symbiotic relationship the brain affects the body the body affects the brain\nAnd with all of that I was a guard dog and just thought this is the most exciting interesting fascinating thing I've ever heard of it I'm so glad I'm In college I Want to be in our scientists\n\nNear diamond was well to this day she's the best teacher that I've ever experienced in my in my entire career and it's because she she was so\nPresent and then gauge and fascinated truly fascinated with the material that she was presenting\nShe has the flare for the dramatic and she wrote everything on the chalk board she said it was because if I write it down you're going to write it down and that gets into your memory and so at the end of the class you're you've already learned most of what you need to learn\nI have to tell you why I still use truck board and do not in power point\nBecause I study learning mechanisms long enough to know that it takes time to take in the primary information and associate it a field guide to flash on things like this you don't get it if you are right you use your kind of set accent\nThat's one way it slows me down it slows you down and I also repeat all the time because we know repeating reinforce [laughter] so we're using things that have been shown for learning rather than just keeping up with technology\nAt the beginning I was captivated with the neuroscience experiments that marrying diamond herself described and she had done so she did these classic studies in the Nineteen sixties showing what happens to the brains of rats if they were raised and what they called enriched environment\n[laughter]\nCertain rich environment is an environment where rats\nAnd you can think of it kind of like the Disney World of environments\nAnd what she showed was the brains of rats raised in those enriched environment we're actually bigger the outer covering of the brain called the cortex actually grew significantly larger\nCompared to rats that were raised in impoverished environments where there was only one one rat in a cage with no toys\nTo we decided to publish it and I spoke to the American association of Annapolis first big contracts that I had it for ... there weren't too many women agenda ...\nWhen I finished a man in the back roads up in it was a big auditorium stood up and shouted [laughter]\nYoung lady that brain cannot change\nNobody had thought that you could have an enriched environment specifically change your brain and an impoverished one change your brain\nIs the first\nNobody else had made such measurement found these results we were terribly excited about\nHer work and this environmental enrichment and brain plasticity was so influential on me I was fascinated both with the brain and with brain plasticity and so when I went to graduate school\nI definitely was was drawn to other forms of experiments that that addressed brain plasticity and my form of brain plasticity that I became fascinated with in graduate school was memory\nEveryday brain plasticity if I learned something new if I learn the name of somebody new and I'm able to remember it sometime later my brain is change and I wanted to try and understand\nWhat that change was and really identify it\n... ...\nIt's it's funny I'm physiology that is recording from brain cells you have to say it's a little bit like fishing you don't know exactly what they I Know they have a campus is involved I don't know what I'm going to find there so I I put my little fishing rod which is a very very thin\nMicro electrode down into the campus so I can\nListen in on what these cells are doing\n[noise]\nI Would be listening to us out as an animal was starting to learn something new and uh someone be doing much of anything that would just be firing every once in a while that I could hear on the audio monitor but\nThen one day I noticed that just as the animals started to learn a particular association the cell that was on the end of my electrode starts to fire more and more consistently right as the animal was learning in the fire\nAs the animal really put it into his memory more more and more strongly would call that consolidating the memory he got better and better and by the end of the session he was performing that association at a hundred percent correct [noise]\n\nI said well maybe maybe I was hearing things but then I went back and analyze the data and when I saw\nIs that this out in about twenty percent of all the cells that are recorded from the campus would change dramatically just as the animal was learning a new association once I got used to I could actually hear this happening\n\nAnd listen to those cells and being able to identify them as we listen to them was kind of like listening to the birth of a new memory [noise]\nToday at one\n[noise]\n\nPublic radio remains all night long here on AOL W San Francisco [noise]\nYou're listening to public

realities on Cape Cod much of the coaches clouding seawalls made with wood concrete and metal they're supposed to hold the line against the retreating shoreline but they're Only Temporary fixes\nMost beaches on the Cape and islands are eroding at a rate of several feet per year George price the director of the Cape cod national seashore to the north beach it's even more\nThe decrease in size was pretty dramatic there was eighty feet of erosion on the ocean side three years in a row that's pretty dramatic\nThe government is owned these cottages since Nineteen sixty one year to Cape Cod national seashore is formed to preserve the coast so\nThe government in other words George price and the national seashore ultimately responsible for the cottages while they're being threatened by origin\nSo frankly it was August first of last year that there was a field trip that involve some of our people and some of the coastal scientists and others\nThat went out to take a look and the word came back to me that it was a lot more immediate than we anticipated and that that was really the the trigger that let me know\nThat there were a couple of cottages at that time in jeopardy\nAgain Robert cruel we really didn't know what was going to happen as all that but within two weeks on the thirteenth of August everybody that had a seashore camp out they received a letter saying we have thirty days to get out and that was it\nSo when you affect five families all at the same time that's really going to be a critical mass of of community a concern\nThe backlash from the families formed a groundswell the media followed the conflict started politicians all the way up to the U.S Senate Sean summers is a local Chatham official\nNobody had argued that we're having um erosion problems and nobody argued that eventually we're going to have to do something uh but we were arguing that there was no imminent problem no imminent danger and I believe that we proved that too I'm a just a button to everybody except for Mr George Burns\nIt's very easy to to pick the the federal manager or the state or the county manager of the inflexible jerk crowd uncaring\nWhen in fact we can tear all we want but if there's a decision to be made about a resource that's going to have a major impact in the future than we have to proceed along those lines that we think is going to be the best for the resource\nAnd so when we did and other folks do was to I'm trying to get some a historic designation some other things just basically some time so we could explain to um the powers that be that in fact this really wasn't a a a threat to anybody out on the beach and the ... just were not in any imminent danger\nBut I think once they made the decision to remove them may just could not change course mean\nHow'd the erosion the facts of the Fox um the the nothing\nChanged over time there was not a change there we if you take a look at the GPS marks and you take a look at a at the

in California for the launch of ... I had to settle\nThe vibe in the control of them is completely different than when you watch a launch what public viewing area it's all business at liftoff the crowd I had just watching the rocket launching the sheer and it goes off and there's all the smoke and fire but for the people in here the job doesn't end and the rocket launches they're monitoring everything\nThey're seeing one of the rocket fire and rightly the engine testify thrust it's quiet\nIntense focus\nAs last wish launched change\nYou know that was my first time a control room I've been to a couple of other launches that Kennedy and you know always been impressed by the rocket far away and how amazing it looks but being in the control center with special for me growing up in the Apollo era I'd always seen that room where everybody's like you know feels go you know it may go down the whole law arms\nAnd I always wanted to be there but I have to say that I was surprised at some of the checks the one in particular that still stands out is umbilical lubricant jak\nThat's a guy named Tom Wagner during launched Thomas sitting right next [noise] can you should wait for the past [laughter] on that Tibet every right to be nervous even working towards these days in more than ten years [noise]\nFrom ... this is horrible a show about the cosmos at our place to find the shelf for [noise]\n[noise]\nOn September

the studies the frozen regions of the earth\nPlaces critical to understanding our planets changing climate\nWhat's really funny is that at the start of it when I was a geology major back in college if you told me I Would work on glaciers I Would have said absolutely not you know it was\nBack in the eighties and you know people were just starting talking about climate change nobody really knew what it meant\nAnd doing ... you were out in the western us mapping glacial Marines from you know twenty thousand years ago and even older when the ice sheets came down from Canada but for me personally I wanted to work on something that was more dynamic and so I originally started working ... hours\n\nI sat ends in two thousand nine I said\nTo his in development it looked like it was going to be a little more complicated the original theory was hey well let's do a single being similar to what we did the original I sat and they said well there's this new fulltime counting stuff it looks like it's inexpensive maybe we could add that has like an outrigger on top of that\nAnd then the more we talked to said you know if we're really going to do that and it's going to work do we really need the big heavy laser in the middle and then you start coughing it all out you know more mass more power bigger spacecraft bigger rocket more energy needed bigger solar panels you start to go\nHey this photo counting stuff is going to use low power laser huh so we can make everything smaller and you know what these low power lasers they last longer than a high powered lasers so a lot of things came together early are where we wound up with the sixty votes on counting system that was really exciting to see and see the science mature along with\nI have to also extends masters ice bridge mission the holy sheet episode of orbital that [noise]\nMap the polar region [noise]\nThe new life have to satellite in state of the heart to determine exactly where it isn't space the satellite actually uses seventh laser beam and a technique that may sound a bit old school\nThat's seven beam gets shot off onto a map that map is up the stars that are over the satellite at that moment and by looking where the laser beam comes into that map relative to the stars we can very very precise figure out the orientation of the instrument [noise]\nAnd I just find that in mind boggling the funny thing is this though [noise] all the people who work on the project to have been doing this since I saw that the kind of go everybody knows about star drivers why are you kidding me I Can't believe this works let alone we need it\nJust the whole idea of knowing what rating is in space right I mean that I mean I think most people aren't aren't don't really know that we use star trackers I could we send Cassini out to Saturn why do we know where it is we're taking pictures of the stars very far away from Saturn and yet because they don't move very\nMuch [laughter] I Know and I feel so old school to me and you almost like navigators of old on the high seas where their sex and [noise]\nSo the point of building this next satellite we mean of course you know the one point is to have a data record that continues that we understand how the ISIS changing in many years to come hoping that I had to be taking data but the other thing is we're making much better measurement more accurate measurement and we had before [noise]\n[noise] yeah and it's it depends on how you quantify but it's like an order of magnitude better you know getting back to the football field analogy I sat would have put one being footprint on each end zone of the field I sat too is going to measure every yard line\nWe're going to get such an amazing new picture of the ice and up the planet on the whole not just doing the polar regions right the satellite is on when it's going over the entire globe\nSo we're going to be mapping things like the heights of rivers and lakes which nobody's ever really done before in a systematic way we're also going to be measuring the height of the world's far\nAnd that's really important as we try to understand the earth's carbon cycle you know fossil fuels to see or two in the atmosphere and then out to plants\nWe don't know how much carbon is tied up in the earth's biomass the forest and I said to going to help us do that [noise]\nWe also want to understand how the sea ice is connected to the global system\nAnd it's both influenced by and also influences is as we've lost the Arctic Sea ice cap we think that it's influencing North America right now it's changing the jet stream of potentially changing storm tracks but at the same time as the planet has warmed up and the polar regions are warming faster than the rest of the planet\nWe know we're losing the size we're losing an extent for us losing in sickness and the thickness one is what we're going to documents so much better with I said to them we ever have\nTo [noise]\nYou were talking about the Nineteen [noise] and we've actually seen that in the ... percent decline in the amount of the aftermath of the sea ice they're\nGoing to love going to like the last ten years has been losing about two hundred billion tons of mass yet we measured each year that incredible\nTo one thing to consider though right is that we also need to know the flux that is how much comes in and how much goes out will take the Antarctica case from it right there if you took all the oceans around the world just picture them in your head now take seven millimeters right\nOff the top\nSo much snow falls on Antarctica every year ... ... even though it's you know it's still considered a polar desert and things it's a tremendous amount now that as you can think of the ice sheets like if you're pouring\nI Know builds up in the center of the ice and then it flows after the sides\nNow we want to get it the process he's controlling it because that's the only way we can really do forecast so one of the things we find is that a coastal areas are losing a lot we think driven by the ocean interior areas may be gaining a little bit\nBut what I set to I think we're going to be able to pull it all together and we're going to see Barry very precisely where changes occurring and that'll let us do a better job with our forecast\nIs it just it's a wonderful story of how you design the like the best laser ever built basically you know when you've got you've got this really interesting new technology there's all kinds of wonderful things like the accuracy of the star tracker but then what's coming out of it is I Try to understand how our planet is changing\nWe you can think of the earth like a giant machine and the parts are all connected to each other and work together we need to know how the atmosphere works how much snow that's bringing to the ice how much when there is it's blowing the sea ice around we need to send the ocean how much he gets bring to the ice sheets and causing it to cast [noise]\n\nAnd with the mission like I said we think we can pull those things together so we can do a better job of forecasting changes\nAnd the fact is unique satellites that do it because if you want to understand how the earth disconnected you need to make measurements all over the place but you need to make them very very precisely and this is where a satellite is perfect it's up there in the environment of space\nIt'll last for a long time it covers the whole planet and you go over and over again making the same measurement everywhere\nAnd that's what really allows us to pull it all together to get this picture of the earth that lets us understand how it is today but also how it's going to change tomorrow\n\nAnd then finally to in in ... its dismal but exciting at the same time\nAs we lose either from the Arctic Ocean we're essentially seem to spin out of a new ocean for the planet [noise]\n\nThe Arctic Ocean right now is highly stratified and the ice forms a platform for a lot of creatures\nTo live as we remove that ice now when can stir the ocean so it's no longer so stratified\nAnd the species that live there change [noise]\nA lot of the species that live in there it's polar regions are very very long lived\nAnd consequently they are very nutritious they built up a lot of fatty acids and things whales come through in each certain kinds of plankton well what's happening is shorter lived species from the Pacific are now able to live in the Arctic and it's more like popcorn you know than helping meal [noise]\nSo to me it's fascinating as a scientist to see what the changes in the eyes the changes in the ocean and like you mentioned even even the chemistry the ocean because the layers are getting mixed up your different species that are moving in\nIt's a fascinating scientific problem huge amounts of data to be taken it also kind of scary yeah and\nI think a lot I mean I have children you know and I think a lot about the future and what their future is going to be like one of the things that I'm hopeful for is that by doing this kind of research we can put bounds around that problem\nAnd help humanity better mitigate the changes that are going to come but what people also have to realize is the change is already hear sea levels already rising\nHas risen and we're getting\nCoastal flooding even around the U.S [noise] but my hope is that with measurements from things like I said\nWe're going to be able to do a better job with projections and help humanity better prepare for what's coming [noise]\nWagoner he's master's program scientists studying the client sphere coldest parts of the year [noise]\nThere are crowds cheering outside and mission control everybody's\nAnd I'm sitting next to Tom Wagner [laughter]\nAnd I have to say Tom Wagner is a hero in mind this is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met he's not getting rich working at NASA he's doing something to his passion studying the ice studying the way the

covered for me um you know I guess it said that he can't tell you a mutt [laughter] okay well being a parent is a lot more than giving advice but if you're in prison it's hard to even do that\nBecause you're in prison yeah but you can actually give advice NBA adapt from prison is harder but a lot of guys here have children and there's all sorts of different ways that they do it and that's what we're going to hear about today and mainly we're going to focus on this guy here\nSo when I was told I was going to be a father started to think about\nWhat type of father that I plan on being\nDerek how the way has been incarcerated for Twenty one years when his son was born there was a twenty four year old drug dinner and had a lot on his mind\nI Can't be a father like this in my current condition\nAnd living the way but I was living are really need to change\nThat meeting to change and actually changing your life Gerecht now knows like two different things\nYou know I'm at the hospital with his mom legacy and his face was like\nIt was like a miracle was like man this is a human being I'm responsible for human me and so the man with trained with that was a whole lot of emotions\nA whole lot a whole lot that I wasn't even really prepared for or have even the emotional intelligence they deal with it\nAnd I just didn't know how to say\nThis child is what's most important I just didn't have the tools\n[noise]\nIn spite of being a new that he didn't change and\nI started getting sucked in to the criminal lifestyle criminal criminal behavior after that it was one of the dogs and\nGo on give me a typical day like what was your you got up and then\nI saw him fall so why would I Would get up at of course I Would have girlfriends strolled all over the city\nSo if depending on what girlfriend house I was at you know so I Would get up and kind of call around and see where everybody was doing where everybody was going to be a [noise]\nBut I was you know the freeway\nKickback see what was going on [noise]\nUm so the typical day really was like me really making sure that the ... the spot where we wish I had had dope out there you know people who are out there they were ready to spot was rolling\nI'm so out of there for a minute but I Would always be trying to run and see what what was the next woman was she was doing I mean I just love women [laughter]\nDerek was living in life he was young he had money women he thought he was on top of it all\nThe soda downfall was I'm\nBeginning really to\nUse drugs\nAnd then he really got in trouble in Nineteen Ninety seven less than a year after his son was born Derek was arrested for first degree murder incentives to thirty seven years to life in\nThe next time Jackson his son he was in prison behind thick glass in a visiting man\nStory so he came to visit on his on his first birthday and I'm just looking at him and some of my thoughts was or\nWas this guy I was going to represent our relationship and um you know for the for the first time I was realizing that they can like that as a possibility that I may never get an opportunity to to see him as a child and grow up and to have some kind of influence in his life [noise]\nSomebody could be better than that\nOne might lead\nTo my own self I I couldn't find a way out I wanted to do something different but I didn't know how and and come into prison\nI actually really gave me that opportunity to sit down and really examine my life in the beginning to get the courage to do something different with my life\n\n\nIn prison Derek ... religion and he's now in prison creature with a full on congregation\nSo what is in prison present you're talking about [laughter]\nThere's a lot of guys\nGet religion fake religion religious but they're not\nLike the real deal how do you know because you can sit in one of his sermons in here just haven't tier two and yeah you know I mean is there any walk\nThe walk you know just walk the walk on the pope and he will have to walk on the yard and he'd go around and counsels people counsel to use so yeah he's real\nBut he couldn't count one's own son when his son's mother died the boys maternal grandmother took him in and she thought it was best to keep them away from his father and Derek only heard what was going on second and third hand\nSo when he was growing up I heard good things early on you know and being a church and and I would send an bibles and you can play football and you know him going to different schools of cottage cheese and and then I started hearing the different things\nAbout him being\nYou know industry lie for going forward and I was really disappointed and even here and I made me feel grief in pain and\nSo he was basically growing up like you were growing up like I was\nA [noise]\nTheir consumers want to get a second chance to parents his son\nAnd we're going to hear about that in a minute but first here's another prison dad with a very different experience of parenting for print [noise]\nCould have been a a a dad at Seventeen\nI think I could get a been a good pop you know as a kid so it was something I wanted and uh I I was excited\nConfident hopeful and fulfilled\nJanice thirty five when his first child was born when he committed the crime that led him to prison his kids were three eight and nine years old\nOr it happen so suddenly it was the the night of December twentieth and I was coming back from a Christmas Party and it was one of those drinking and driving fatality cases [noise] so I didn't have time to\nTo to think well what what would happen if I were taken away from my kids that are never never occurred to me [noise]\n\nIt was just utterly chilling the sudden from the very beginning are being separated from them was a you know the most gut wrenching part of it besides of course what what\nHad happened that two young innocent lives were taken because of what I had done\nWhat I tried to be open with them about my responsibility I tried to to get them tuned into that you know not to thinking of me is the victim and I think that made that made them a little more receptive to our parent child relationship do\nAnd even that was awkward when you're on a but I had to force myself to it like and like this with the reality man like you know I'm like why is that\nWatch them walk up the stairs sometimes right to walk them how he always\nHow how I used to walk and so when I watch it woke up the stairs sometimes I'm like\nJust staring at him by man look at me that is me and\nSometimes it is so overwhelming because nobody wants prison for their child and so it makes me more protective you know now more like okay where are you at and and I'll I'll see them but I don't let them see me [laughter]\nThat brings up a whole nother thing but yeah just watching them watching his mannerisms how we interact with people\nOn the teacher hardly interact with people in the prison very outgoing\nAnd I tell them is all the time I saw you just a function in um extrovert because really your introvert like [laughter] you really want to be by yourself you really do good by yourself because we're outgoing people want you know people talk to us and like us and so I see that as you know\nBut he has no problem\nBeing myself [laughter] we\nBasically do anything just like when I get ... but I go outside at night and I did the walk of when now just walking like what the hell is you're doing out here is like may I feel like be above it and then we both ended up just being out there and walk in there we always run into each other out there like man [noise]\n\nI'm nervous every time the alarm goes off\nI didn't like where is he\nIs involved is there was a fight 'em [laughter]\nYou

in prison here's a clip from that episode\nI had been at this prison for two years and we had mastered the art of being intimate on the patio\nIt got us to talking and she's like I Wish I could have a kid right now and that got me to think and I'm like\nOh man this is the only thing that you can give her you um you should go ahead give it is I Wonder when you get a visit like maybe once\nHow old is

parents and siblings\nCome to stay with us for a few days in a cottage yeah and we asked mavericks to tell us about the latest family visit he had with his wife and his son\nI cut his hair for the first time and that's like a rite of passage for every father to cut his son's here at some point in time and he was scared at first because the whole month before the visit I told you better not get your hair cut\nOh All right uh you know he was skeptical and then I brought my ma clippers out and when it came time to do it might take off her shirt and he's and bears because you know he's\nHe's a little bit fellow for his age and now he's like oh and it was so funny I'm like boy if you don't stop him ... daddy I gave you that you know ain't no judgment I ain't never going to judge you\nOr

you know I got to pay for it and get their ... and I was like\nYeah boy you won't be able to get that\nEvery day when I come home\nAnd it it just gave me a glimpse of how thirsty he is to have a father and his life but I Believe that a surety of\nExactly when I was going to come home it was occupied too much of his mind\nI got him worrying about me in here so much where he can't focus in class and that's what hurts me the most me not being able to help him process\nThis me not being able to be there to to just be there to help him to hold him to let him know what is going to be All right\n[noise]\nIt's been a long struggle but the good news is is some might have is dead home soon maverick has a day which means he could be released on parole sometime this year [noise]\nThinks are

go lotus from various cultures so tell me a little bit about that mix and how was the other senior gotcha\nOkay so I grew up in the Midwest in central Indiana and we didn't do a ton of super traditional stuff but my dad always made sure that one thing was around during the holidays\nTiny town so is this kind of dry bread cake thing with candy fruit inside originally it's actually from Italy is called panicked on me so I was always like why is this here this isn't a Latino thing this is an Italian thing but I found out that\nIn the early Nineteen hundreds this Italian ice cream vendor actually made his own brand of tiny tone and through and that's where it became wildly popular\nAnd it's now super popular in Peru it's a staple for every Christmas there's something like a hundred friends and it's popular now two in al ... and in parts of the Andes where they actually fill it with a potato and carrot\nAnd the Bolivian fill it with coca leaf I've heard which is really interesting I'm I'm going to be honest though new chemical stuff\nBut apparently they're versions with chocolate and I feel like I I Would be into that I just never really liked the the ones with candy fruit and stuff in it but that that wasn't my thing\nAnother thing that we did every year to is this holiday called ... it's celebrated in many countries it's when the three wise men that Jesus\nWe always made a cake and I'm half French so weak in France we call it the ...\nBut in Spanish it's called ... it is\nAnd we put a baby inside at this little figure\nFor our family my little brother ... is the youngest so he would go under the table and decide which slice of cake went to whom and if you've got the baby and your cake then you working for the day so I always thought that was kind of a fun holiday to for us to celebrate\n[laughter] well that sounds fun and you know it sounds like a melting pot of celebration and the thing that I find fascinating is that how being let
