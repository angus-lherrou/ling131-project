S. dot ORG and the listeners who support this NPR station\n[noise]\n[noise] from NPR News this is all things considered I'm Audie\nCornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump they include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says that powder and at least some of these aren't elopes does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of alcohol\nThese devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them\nAnd did that without happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida\nBesides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and the postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen no new packages run through the system and just briefly carry while this person or persons are still on the loose\n\nSupport for NPR comes from

diminished ration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with\nWisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we really reward\nImmigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we are talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I'm nobody's called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and I was failing units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but a new one I toured the the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got\nI I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravan they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change\nIf you knew is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to go to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison grand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products from homeland security most of these laws are under my major's diction we've gotta do to my community jurisdiction because that was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues adopt their agree with that I can start handling so I Try to go through this as a business person would\nBe a problem solver gather the information five years or agreement in our community where you know we all want to or that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and that may be successful breeds success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time every day it's Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and attorneys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its fields competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants say they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee and the safety of numbers\n\nThirty four year old ... Vasquez ... sister was seven kids between them stop to grab some free coffee and bread hands out by local residents in southern Mexico\nAnd they've been walking for days they heard about the hundreds leaving Honduras via social media last week and grabbed a bus catching up with a caravan right before cross into Guatemala\nNot that bad I don't know if they need in kind of I\nI think we've been waiting months to join up with a caravan leaving says Vasquez said she wanted to flee Honduras after her husband was exploded and killed by gang members she says there was no way she could pay a smuggler thousands of dollars and\nWhen she got attacks on WhatsApp describing the size of this one it seemed the safest way to go [noise] talking to migrants on the track north you hear similar

D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his\nUh uh the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for\nOther analysis is only ... however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nOr else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent there they're focusing an investigation or asking\nFor tips from the public are there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is were these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a cure your and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I\nSpoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWell the baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden and Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan and what's really interesting is actually found by retired cop\nWas working for um the Sunni rose production company and he spotted it after noticing very similar resemblance to photos of

including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now\nNPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hit or David ... so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a shovel panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] trying to get in trouble if you are a white person who was on the waiting for a black person a facade of white flight\nThat was okay as long as you were a character\nAnd that of course they're tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story of both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show and the hours proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really weird and not first let's hear from our broker she noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nA bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows\nWasn't right and then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co hosted today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted uh a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much beloved figure who retain says that ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear would um we do every year in ... which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical literacy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking to this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with levy as animal is to play on caricatures played the caricatures of course and that fits next to obviously this broad the human condition that allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWell the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missile shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show ...\n[noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something it who's receiving it so when you controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video have to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much Mary Louise season is over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise] this is NPR News\nThere is an oil boom in ... Texas it's one of the most competitive congressional district in the country how politics are playing in the oil fields\nThat feel like it's going to dry up and you\nBut the latest on suspicious package threats that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning from five to nine AM Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco\nDoes\nHe do you is your take on music your passport that journey of the imagination to myth legend and ... and salads in June from ... I Hope you'll come along with me on camera in\nThis coming Saturday afternoon at two thirty here on KLW in San Francisco [noise]\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here\nIn the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country\nIn the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars and other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is for the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was uh\nThe contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would\nYou tell them you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations control much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nFrom KLW this the sights and sounds your weekly guy to the bay area art seen
