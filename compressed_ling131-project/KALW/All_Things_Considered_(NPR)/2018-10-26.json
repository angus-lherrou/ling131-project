all including illegally Malian explosives and threatening former presidents as well as others\nCan can you tell us a little bit about the clues and the evidence that led the FBI to him\nIt was actually a clue from one of the packages FBI Director Christopher Wray says the FBI was able to pull a fingerprint off of one of those ... manila envelope so we talked about a lot of the past week\nThat fingerprint match say ox a race says there's also a possible DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent in two separate packages\nThose appear to match sales because well a and authorities have also identified a identified a Twitter account that they said belong to him and the clues there are some of the words that were misspelled on the packages match the misspelling on the Twitter account\nWell I Know that you are librarians others that NPR has been looking into his background today tell us what you've learned about um\n[noise] well he's fifty six years old he is a resident of South Florida are you registered as a Republican in March of twenty sixteen he has a pretty lengthy criminal history in Florida that includes charges of a felony theft

national\nUnemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their has through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run the plant was the world's largest plan under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee motion all yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he said at the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas\nBut uh yeah it was a dark and scary and you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on\n... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce\nDon Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs\nBeautiful here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace\nPolicies that eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing the Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nVery much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me I Know your\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don ... son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all that she was in his work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nThrows out running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrill heart\nHating runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job\nThey're all making less money than they did it willow run and what about the plant itself has seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay draws a him six hurting the freeway with\nOur tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars dumps Skidmore seems shaken revisiting his past\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there you know so we\nWe left that\nWe liked the trees like the leaves and on the street is kinda cool kind of eerie and\nKnow I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant if now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used\nNow stars are driving by themselves\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone\nBut on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo United

to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWe've not had any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however a ... officer and an attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they can't have a valley of course that defendants house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he set an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private range land you got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week he\nSaid quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me no one will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ... we've\nHeard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd at least thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him were overwhelmed\nImmigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing some are paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nOr the White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and he'll give it's his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John you about [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong paste thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were a scientist potential trouble including leak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that's historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected\nIt was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter\nStill the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr shut records around Labor Day an immoral Davis your fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending offer protect spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who were spending more\nGovernment spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there\nIs little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... who is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see some headwinds appearing before the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJacko also site say gradual slowing in the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated\nThere's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working\nIn spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong\nJim Zarroli NPR News\nYou're listening to

shopping\nBut FBI agents swarmed the facility this morning read off a major highway and we're looking through the computer system and questioning employees here an auto zone does track customers by their cell phone number when they make a purchase\nSo FBI agents were here for a few hours looking through that the computer system\nSo that'll went down this morning what does it seem like now\nSo it's still a media frenzy here of course but I'm a little quieter the store's been closed for the rest of the day\nBut a lot of customers have come up and tried to come in and get things like oil for
