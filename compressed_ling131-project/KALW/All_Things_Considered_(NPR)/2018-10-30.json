to you David not to lead to a time as ... as we continue with all things considered from Washington NPR [noise]\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ...\nChang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nIn an interview with actually oh the Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on actually is on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose actual hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually that Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating talk like this more than a decade and now they got a president\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U. S. is unusual but it is not unique there are over thirty countries that are also have birthright citizenship mostly they are in the western hemisphere including Canada Mexico Brazil Argentina but we are not alone\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Amazon Studios presenting beautiful boy based on father and son memoirs beautiful boy chronicles her family's experience of survival

overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party or post Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you do you go around I mean given the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commits reading about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and plus he had followed the presidential election\nThe trust was by the women's march I have actually when I was calling [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was with black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\n... he's away from family we show what is\nWhere the\nWife of why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Julie\nWilliams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I get up relationships in the middle of it because I didn't have\nWell he did\nMy ... my ...\nAll star game\nWe use ...\nEvery man and the whole but these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything reveal Berkes resented the implication editor of zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own packed\nThe CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack so when you look at the fire walls\nYou'd be seen on directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day that the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to

belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in the scheme do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of detailed in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me\nThe okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make of the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nUh which is owned by Trump cough it up Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty out in a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stores\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against Miller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week\nNPR's ... eyes and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month the usual ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nYet Rick yeah but if you're young somehow rocks that somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home on this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child a ...\nA boy of seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived at first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the budget for the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn going on to something I'm honored be you're going to be now you just fears of worse or you're trying not to look like they're rushing because showings here will provoke the ground but you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the tears these government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week partly it's because many people in communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people in scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nLocal populations very distrustful of the government even though this part of the D. R. C. has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves we haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not have the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands\nOh one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped to doesn't children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even you know whether they're true motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city have been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone he was had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored\nArthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contracts and the disease spreads\nThe world Health Organization has called for more security and the operate zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence NPR seat\nSo it's very unlikely to peacekeepers in the outbreak down right now the UN's main focus on the deer see our elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of that or you end up a shift pieces on the transport\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country\n[noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
