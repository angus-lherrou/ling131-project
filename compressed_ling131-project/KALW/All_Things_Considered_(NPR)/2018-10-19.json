Veasey\nPresident Trump is campaigning in Arizona tonight the trick is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters head of the midterm elections which are now just over two weeks away last night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the midterm elections to this\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of cabinet all the caravan\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border now big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why is President Trump talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans ah he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news ah and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally\nWithout offering any evidence um it made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind that care about\nWhat they wanted the caravan and there are those the say the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully before it ever get [noise]\nShould underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new ...\nIsn't isn't incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican and the upcoming elections asked about twenty different issues facing the country\nAnd those supporting Republicans intimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced uh within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a based play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI think what this election supposed to be about the Republicans tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now an immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip\nFrom red to blue unless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge\nTraveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant thirty port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could uh give the Republicans some hope so\nEspecially in Hispanic community is away Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floor is he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump's\nThan for security order you know you need certain order and in your home you know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall of the good it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better door when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seem to have been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me\nI mean ... all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJoseph ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters decide to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera [noise]\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics middle support immigration reform\nAnd party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for real and I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do a paper doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican I was born and raised in Jordan parents were from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and when you increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI have to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a stubborn you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juices\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis was going to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you get ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there\nMay already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew as shouting ties we

local public radio station ... am that'd be you can find that all the details by clicking on a donate button and KLW that old a gene thank you so much\nThanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised the Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David ... years the United nations special repertory on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world have has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... because she'll G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have\nAll of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight ... seems really um counter to what to do with the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nUh is to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation looked like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by\nA high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation and um you know at the very minimum it can involve analyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two\nOr it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion ...\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide uh they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject\nTo ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block the Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorized an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but\nA credible international investigation that David Cay thank you [noise]\nYou use the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin\nNow there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick rocks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is how many people ... and we actually put them in we constantly did emails that I've met more people having Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with youth or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where the libraries and our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nA hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that if somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of his idea that's what he was\nMe she's

friend\nHe was indeed and I mean we this is something that we have known and suspected now for sixteen days but the Saudi announcement lax total credibility\nThe they have claim for two weeks that he walked out of the ... and the idea that that a committee led by Mohammad bin ... on the crown prince is going to investigate something that\nHe has been implicated in is\nGoing to lead to a lot of questions I think around the world there is no Robert Mueller\nAnd the kingdom and it's going to be very hard for them to say anything that people are going to believe\nWhen we moved back to a couple of points you raise their show first jump in and let me let you just give any more detail that Saudi TV is providing what exactly was a statement to me well as you said they they said that it was a\nA fight that I'm In which he died a which was a ... sounded rather odd\nUm ... given the fact that that the Turks have been telling us that there were Fifteen people there are the Saudis have I don't even fight exactly uh the Saudis have said that I'm Eighteen people have been arrested now in this case um\nSeveral people have been relieved from their duties and that includes um a royal court advisor who's close to crown prince Mohammed bin so much on so you know it it it's obviously getting close to him but uh it's not clear what if he's ready at all to take any credit for it it sounds like\nThey're trying to blame lower level people ...\nTo to the point that Robin Wright just made\nHow much confidence should we have in this version of events um given that it is a completely different version of events than the one that the Saudis have been sticking to before yeah you have to remember that they said that ...\nLeft the consulate I'm so they totally denied any knowledge of it\nUm I was just there ah with secretary of state Mike Pompeo we went to um both Saudi Arabia and to um to turkey to grow\nAnd you know ... ... ... at the time he said that the crown prince and the king both denied any knowledge of this uh of what took place in the consulate\nUm and he was giving them more time to investigate so here's what we have they've investigated now and they're taking uh some action against some people but it's not clear how much accountability there will be at the very\nTop Robin I'm among the Eighteen people who have apparently been arrested or they're there to a
