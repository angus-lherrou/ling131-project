Chang\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they are the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns to look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood at\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nIt's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the there's also in that area there's a causeway the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now just a single\nPatrick Miller going west would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a ... watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but and I've watched go no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you well\nAnd and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... there are but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way him the most votes escape major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage or working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk\nAll right let's move now to the political storm that had gripped Washington in the country last week it

today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor health for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority that Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he'd been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mere and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and sent a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen a\nPresident ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment the Jamal\n'cause she'll get case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nCan take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery\nIt's to the White House press corps vending machine he was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns free to lay which makes ... in fact the vending machines got use it in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo or valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a freak though there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that tells us in a bag of free to\nCarolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do as well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets emit analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this offering company a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies and it looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category alive many of the other hand categories and that allow\nCompanies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum tariffs\nIt went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats\nThe indicator from Planet Money support for planet\nMoney comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News\nI'm recovering after Michael will have the latest on the storm that devastated parts of the south east flush of Nineteen eighty six fire destroyed the LA public libraries Susan Orlean on the unsolved mysteries that didn't just destroy books\nLibraries you feel like these big collective brains because they have the memories and stories of the whole culture inside them Saturday on\nWeekend edition from NPR News this week in addition tomorrow morning six to nine here on that one point seven\nI don't know what to make the news is it politically inflict it is it ... the is it just plain on true on the media helps you decode the news we reveal the process behind the story\nBecause there's some times as much to be learned from the gathering as from the news itself please join us\nThat it's on the media this evening since the clock here on anyone ... seven\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photos of names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely that they would suddenly underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling kept his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it\nSomething like digital researcher digital investigator digital something\nProbably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just time Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists\n[noise] when you look at these photos on there on our on our website\nJust a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through and kind of sightseeing at this military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person ... shows are boy ... 'em up on the wall\nColonel ana totally ... the speeding image of demand and the photo released by the British right there on the wall with his name's spelled out for all to see and bell and cat turned up a lot more it turns out if you're willing to risk getting a nasty computer virus you can download all sorts of Russian databases\nThings like insurance databases um driver's licenses voter database and things like this is one hundred percent legal but it's out there\nIn in those databases they've found way more photos and details about their ... old phone numbers and addresses including one that linked him to a local military intelligence headquarters\nThis week they also id ... tell us by a guy they think is named Alexander Michigan Michigan came from a small town in Russia as far north once they found him belly can't worked with Russian journalists to send someone up there\nAnd they had a picture and are showing around people in the town they're like oh yeah that that's all right you know that ... that ... and short in Russia in ... Michigan over there he's a good you know it was a good boy he's a good lead his grandma Ninety two year old grandma always shows us a photo of him receiving a metal from boosting\nRussian President

important to have more people are aware of how to do this kind of things and most of the times it's not too hard\nI caught up with him and told her during a training they were doing near Washington

Internet you just have to\nRain rain goes [noise] [noise] [noise] if you are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season ... next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player\nIs right the athletic ran who may is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nAnd it was a shoo them meet famous like New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey\nGood so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been white\nTwenty years since there last basketball she went him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd a deal that broke her after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now\nBut when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal\nWith tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year and like she had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes less well okay step into combat that is pretty tough to find okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started about ... cousin so\nKnow in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nReally tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think\nOne thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out hula hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of\nWild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's meta kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways\nHow these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting she ran than what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game\nAnd they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and there's the snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think that Rand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that\nThey don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that\nMaybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be\nGoing to be a huge push for sure Mm Nick DiPaolo covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes so much Nick start\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening

there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro urge state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's\nOn the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is the knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop ... role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address\nBecause in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the\nPope I think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaning for you\nTribes show the active role that bishop ...\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nWith respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the Cape becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your offices report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving this statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of\nThe people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and\nLaw enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled at critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws but at least succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to let the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because they can let it would have had real difficulty and doing it's work and wave hide hadn't gotten all the brown\nJaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution\nThat's because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases that secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work\nBut not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referrals to Congress\nThe national or I let me see a lot of uh from the water ... a year to that was very interesting I when I asked you to load that was set up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry Schwartz stole\nIt's relevant to historians is relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign in one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the so called wrote something that lower team destroyed likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document\nMeanwhile the battle over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end this week judge barrel how ordered the national archives to review it and directed the Justice Department to get ready for its release Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington

C. C. S. S. dot O. R. G. slash arts\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hike so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing\nAnd a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself uh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose\nRisk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident of that\nEconomic analysis using them for me you think\nThe institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where\nI think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for
