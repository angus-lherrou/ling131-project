this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports have been predicting but this report says these consequences will happen sooner yeah\nThat's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out with such precision the hearing now element of his problem is not do it for the grandkids so many of these effects that you just mentioned hit around twenty forty also I think you and I plan to be here\nAround twenty I order and they do yeah so this is a kind of hearing now impacts of the scientists were writing about\nWhat would it take to avert this I mean there's a report is saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are are real changes feasible within that timeframe\nAbsolutely like this you hear some of those studies and you it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix can hear you but if you think about it

streets and into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration so be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but an airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when illumination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color\nMuch more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there\nRaces so you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters as someone who really understands\nWhere this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nSomething that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at

no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association\nAnd and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\nYes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place we started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when Alice Alice ... acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping\nUp for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compounds you misspoke just one big argument in favor of government regulation in part because it certainly\nOr government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those

up Virginia politics\nOr speak to my mind and some people are afraid of controversy when they run for the hills of the first chance that somebody talks about something that's controversial I'm not like that\nBut those tactics haven't proved popular with most Virginia voters incumbent Democrat Tim Kaine has held a consistent double digit lead in the polls nationally Republicans don't expect the race to affect the balance of power in the Senate\nThe worry now is whether it could affect the balance of power in the house as many as four Republican controlled house seats in Virginia could be in
