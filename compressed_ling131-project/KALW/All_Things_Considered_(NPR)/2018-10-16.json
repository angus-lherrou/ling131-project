in a minute but start with the objects they are tricky I mentioned friendly handshakes them smiles meanwhile the agenda is to to discuss an alleged murder murder plot by the Saudis\nYeah it was kind of striking because you know on the face of it it looked like this very typical visit by a secretary of state going to see the king in his palace a brief stop\nAt the foreign ministry um and a lot of time with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who's this young very powerful figure here we're told that the conversations have been directed candid you know dip below speak for quite tough\nBut you wouldn't know it by watching these men greeting each other in front of the cameras and talking about how important this relationship is\nEr at talk about the substance what did they say to each other in these direct and candid talks\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nUm U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports in the news that the Saudis are now portraying this as a like a interrogation gone horribly wrong we don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spending this with ... in private or if he believes them but we do know that

the Trump Administration there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these are U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and they the U.S needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil markets stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress um members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the ... end over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary Pompeo was headed next ah which means you are headed next

first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us\nThank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here will you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be two people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican or states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think guy frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae ... people do you think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that\nI'm getting into politics it's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs inside a [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age yeah\nThis is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how do you what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that that I asked ever ask anybody what party they will with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and getting a moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me as young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow events that it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we've ...\nIs more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us\nI Want to thank all three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all

another case of quote guilty until proven innocent\nTrump says the Saudi crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened and promised a full investigation\nTrump separately has suggested rogue killers might be to blame\nTo understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nSaid explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship and that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitment as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ... uh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as of drug dealers\nThere is a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we killed people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president's condemn the actions of foreign leaders whether that was one of them are putting in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those leaders\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from logged me in

rules for discipline and women's presence\nHere's this town we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors finding shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different\nInside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don ... depending on what level there and that's the warden show Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now are are outside and our yard with any ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war in this the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disappointed that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nAre often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch what NPR Emmett Till school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's have men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children each you know younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets\nWe're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform it was written for men's prison where a shirt inside out or sleeves rolled up might signal a gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections\nIn the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different paths to the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nTell me about it that was like\n\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and statement or sell through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\nRunner got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then ... says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary wonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here hoped to grow\nShe works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much attention so I'm not a shame you know and it helped me with my own my own shame I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women then dumping them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was teased and psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nIn prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence so\nMean can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on\nShow dumb the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome prison ... welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words\nThe inmates are running the prison\nThe wording has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six to not caused problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison\nThe old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one of their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night this is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running in prisons are making a difference in the way they're rough you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNot young ... is sales victim of war crimes she lost her family and for a time for freedom\nShe found the courage to speak out about the competing against her now she has won a Nobel Peace prize conversation not MRI\nFor the latest on the search\nFor tomorrow to show tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nWe're nation tomorrow morning here starting at five thirty I Am here in Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco local public radio we're on line at K. levine tattoo R D\nAnd Teddy Kennedy with you like take a moment to think ... members including a Esther and Nicholas Moran of the San Francisco\nDickey still very very much for your support the times for thirty [laughter]\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth and very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough August there is such a hidden\nGenius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump\nA but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nSo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with\nKushner was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show she went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent\nA but right now the crown prince has denied any knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of course there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat says that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett Berlin who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel out to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear\nAs some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports are that Kushner a cushion or a backed\nOr associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHurricane
