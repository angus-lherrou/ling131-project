dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly\nYear on year the strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S [noise] the we couldn't have been\nWell partly counteracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest\nIn China you know for Tesla to buy land and below product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he

down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it on on on these days and this person is on the unprecedented Liz from the court\nLoved one was confused why couldn't he book this dream ticket he started looking into the situation and he quickly realize why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the black lists the unpleasant words they live on that uh you're\nFired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train\nYou can fly China started the black with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of his his involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account in credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards

notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to\nYou started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around about what don't\nBecause actually the friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think

the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible\nBut it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will keep paying off his debts she has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff
