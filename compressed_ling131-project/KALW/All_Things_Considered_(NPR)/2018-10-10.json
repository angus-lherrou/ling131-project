Wall street today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about ... what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah it was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right are there fewer than inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair or a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at fifty or low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled it bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by to sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the market sold off today a wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very tough day for tech\nAnd very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend\nFor the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down was due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued\nHigh levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession\nWe're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying you starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens will say that is NPR's John Ydstie think John You're welcome\n\nYou're listening to all things considered

within the police department ultimately after another officer involved shooting police chief Greg ... resigned as always against the backdrop of heightened tensions nationwide over police killings of black men those tensions continue today\nAnd Mario woods was suspected of stabbing the man when officers found him standing at a trans would stop several officers surrounded woods I'm a semi circle

up here with all of the monitors around the room people are getting real time situational awareness on any number of issues there even in many cases wearing color coded invest so everybody knows\nWho's working what station in what smaller units there working within so they can just reach right across the table in many cases to coordinate with maybe a Red Cross representative\nOr the department of health representative and and the like\nSure and what kind of calls to have coming in right now\nLeading up to the storm they were mostly people looking to um get a bit of a status of things I think the nature of the calls now I have turned it mostly to power outages and that sort of thing\nWhich I guess in the grand scheme of things would be good news if people are worried about power outages it's it's so far you're not getting calls from people who need to be rescued from Derek situations\nThat's correct or however as we expect significant damage from downed trees that constitutes a threat now community known for its canopy roads large pines in ... we have not responded\nTo that risk a yet however I should note that our emergency crews in our public works crews themselves are sheltering from the storm at this time\nHow much damage are you seeing right now\nIt's too early to tell a the damage assessments will happen immediately following the worst part of the storm when our crews can get out and take a look at things are first order of business is always um life safety\nSo clearing roads will be our afar first responders the will of course the first priority for us\nAnd what most people in Leon county doing do you have any numbers in terms of how many have evacuated versus how many of hunker down and burned up their windows and the writing this out\nWell I think a large a\nPortion of our population did decide to hunker down and ride the storm out and we are about sixty miles away from the ... however we do have seven risk shelters opened in our community with Fifteen hundred people currently in those shelters\nThat does sound like high schools are where they set up\nThey are in ... in our high schools and won a special needs shelter

U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands aka she'll get to capture him or the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably to show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes if someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off and\n... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard of it he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... MPs sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade has the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and at that very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about it the best cases and therefore I can sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues so advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion\nPlanned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country have to access funding they have to access transportation they have to\nThat is going to be a greater need if they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be supersized again says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal lot\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network that states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nName rallies also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List the cabin offsite has also served as a reminder of the importance of elections\nCat on a confirmation battle kind of exemplified why we're back to this to begin with you know why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know precisely the Senate is aware Supreme Court justices are an armed\nWith Kevin on the Supreme Court advocates on both sides say their bases are energized and ready for the next phase of the battle over abortion rights Sarah McCammon NPR News\nThis is NPR News\n...
