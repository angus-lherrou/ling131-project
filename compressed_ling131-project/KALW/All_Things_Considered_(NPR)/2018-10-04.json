on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSince the first thing this morning senators from both parties have been taking our long turns in a secure underground room in the capital visitor center inside that room one copy of the FBI's report on Kavanaugh's expanded background check\nThe reporters confidential and has not been made public so all we know is what we've heard from senators and people at the White House who have seen it or been briefed on it\nIn the wee hours of this morning the White House released a statement saying it had received the report from the FBI and that quote with this additional information the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court\nBy late morning Democrats responded\nThe most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nSenator Dianne Feinstein the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee appeared alongside minority leader Chuck Schumer\nWe had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts\nHaving received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized\nSo Democrats see this FBI report as incomplete Republicans say on the contrary and they have scheduled a final confirmation vote within the next forty eight hours on let's hear from one of those Republicans now Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota senator rounds\nWelcome thank you very much appreciate the opportunity to visit\nLet me start with a yes or no question do you believe what the FBI has produced represents a complete and thorough investigation\nI Do it's simply ... there's been six earlier ones this is the seventh in this particular case they went back and we didn't either hands we just simply said you go back and do the supplemental based on what a group of Republicans who had concerns that expressed\nThat they wanted to learn more about they talked about the specific incident itself and about other allegations they went through and lifted those out they actually interviewed I Believe ten individuals and and made eleven report\nOkay that you're adding to our information there 'cause my information was that they had interviewed nine individuals so if you've seen it maybe they're up to ten okay I think it was ten\nTotal what should they contacted ten individuals nine individuals participated one declined to participate didn't want to participate\nBut let me ask you about two people who they did not interview because this is raising a lot of questions for Democrats they didn't interview Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford\nWell that's because they both went through literally hours and hours of testimony before the Judiciary Committee both of them have actually had reviews before and so the the FBI had their choice as to who they wanted to interview and when\nAnd they decided not to interview either one didn't feel that they needed to interview either one however both were allowed if they

avenue people told me to go to church\n[laughter]\nDavid Cay Brawley is one of the leaders of east Brooklyn congregations in his office he tells me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning of the civilization burned out homes empty lots people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession than the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city governments sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the man in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was going and we need it\nI feel is Audra mom she and her husband came to New York from Honduras and believes fleeing poverty they identify as both black and Hispanic they say they're grateful that public housing was available when they needed it but jumped on the chance to move on when the children were born\nI didn't like elevators up and down the elevators for my children because it was a lot of people living in the housing projects\nFor a lot of people in Brownsville and surrounding areas coming up with thirty thousand dollars for a house was impossible for the Blasio family it took generations worth of savings\nMy mother ... then

right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nSo we will see NPR's Kelsey Snell thanks and watching you well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at\nNine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he shows they used to drink together that would Kavanaugh drink he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr you know did um I ah eventually did reach them by from the due to them told me what exactly to do first and then killed sending your request for\nThe form to fill out and then I filled out performance art with a former run this had been pre filled by the uh\nThat took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called back I we're by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email or nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all it was like one should live in front of the so usually committee or whether it's taken oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic by was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of where the phrase was black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he\nGiven the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never\nGot to the condition how can one new\n[noise] they let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's\nWhere I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like nudey three maybe forty five year college and then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nOr job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case and the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants to work will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those\nAre like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nIs ...

I understand you've seen the report can you give us your reaction [noise]\nWell I was really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr ... gave to the FBI or that corroborate their stories were not interviewed\nYou say you should be a fair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI that they are when they're told to be allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I thought today in the narrow scope that they've given that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both Mr ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them\nI mean that's part of it and if and when we\nThat's where someone is a victim of sexual assault that they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that how traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later\nAh where she told a therapist or her husband talked about it I have so many women tell me their stories in the airport and the grocery store over the last week or so\nThat that's exactly what happened to them and I think those have to be credible and understood that and if you want to get a correct response and understand the full story you can't just ask someone who is in the house at\nThe time I Know there's been a lot of frustration on both sides of the aisle about how this has been handled elsewhere in the program we spoke with Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota and here's part of what he said\nThe Senate is supposed to be advising consent and then this particular case so strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission\nFrom day one so there's a Republican accusing Democrats of a search and destroy mission against judge Kavanaugh how do you respond\nWell first of all let's remember that we're doing a job interview for someone who's going to be on the Supreme Court for a very long time who will have an impact on generations to come to this is a lifetime appointment\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video presenting their return of the man in the high castle were America's history is under siege but the resistance rises to fight for the world they want the new season for\nTables with printers prints are ... and toner cartridges for home and business and ... print shop for customized presentations booklets and manuals\nMore stable stores or staples dot com stables\nFrom NPR News this was all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly the u._s. joined European governments today and accusing ... group Russian military intelligence officers of more cyber mischief the indictment from the U. S. Justice Department describes hacks against sports stars and against anti doping agency's in the u._s. and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted aid Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill ... former Russian spy\nAnd beer national justice correspondent Gary Johnson was asked the Justice Department today she has most days and she has back here ... studio now with details you carry I'm Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now it's the timing\nYeah the defendants are setting current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer ... twenty Eighteen oh so it's just very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all\nOf these seven Russian officers are in Russia and there is no us ... extradition treaty in place so who why bother charging them well\nFBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled the European countries where there are ... extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen the D. O. J. says it's practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nAnd the assistant attorney general for national security ... told reporters that Russia launched this cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes were invading drug\nTest embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\n... I was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines for us to announce these charges just hours after Britain and the other when ... announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually ... international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in DC today they highlighted how the Dutch we're actually able to disrupt the hacking plot and April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passports travel did the Hague and rented a car and then filled ... with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition ... chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife ... networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the oh P. C. W. was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter and the u._k. this year for the ... exact okay\n... here's here's my big question which is what two these charges tell us if anything about\nThe ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions are we any closer to\nRussian interference videotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment doesn't include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if show the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this case\nNPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett

[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] this is NPR News\nHi this is Steve Inskeep with NPR's MORNING EDITION our goal is to bring your news\nMatters to keep you in touch with information that you need to make sense of the world can what can seem like a senseless time\nOver the course of a day a week a month the news unfolds and were there with your day by day listening to MORNING EDITION every day [noise]\nTo our morning meeting at five and a local publicly\nHigh it's Lawrence Taylor one of the most compelling places for women today is coming to Berkeley\nFor an inflection point live recording joined me and best selling author and all of a single ladies with Becca Traister and her new book good in math and revolutionary power went in and\nThis live event is presented by the bay area but festivals and winning let society inflection point payouts every Wednesday after ... in Berkeley tickets are winning let die for it [noise]\nWas rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRocks paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this was when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst\nThe co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have\nThe results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation\nIn the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fall doctor actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me [noise]\nSure Stewart is a planetary scientist at the
