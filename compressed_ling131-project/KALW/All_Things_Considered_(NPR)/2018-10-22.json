the Saudis acknowledged it only Friday after denying it for weeks\nThey say the country's rulers knew nothing about the operation acclaimed viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the aims of the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slow she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from his stumble welcome to the program thank you so ah to give us some context there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there\n[noise] yeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a fellow by turkey and backed\nBy the Saudis so essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government I think\nThere are certainly has always been a challenge in a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now is particularly directed against Mohammed bin\nSell them on a known as as NBS and this was around prince right now\nAbsolutely of who can ... designated as the air and twenty Seventeen uh everyone I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns uh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades\nAnd I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish\nAir to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on M. B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new air called\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really at President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened that that effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to assemble a to providing a possibly in are the ones who remarks tomorrow more evidence of direct link of these operations to NBS himself\nWhich then it would put further pressure on Trump in terms of his response\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and use screener questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidate learn more and indeed dot com slash higher\nElaborate of meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learned more is go to meeting dot com and from listen like you who donate to this NPR station\nFrom NPR News it's all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I know that Chang\nThe U.S military command in Afghanistan has acknowledged that an American general was wounded during a deadly insider attack last week in the southern city of Kandahar initially the command described him only as quote un American service member NPR's Tom Bowman has more details\nOn Thursday brigadier general Jeffrey smiley was in a meeting at the Kandahar governor's compound was senior American and Afghan officials just before the meeting broke up an Afghan guards suddenly turned his weapon on those present\nThe guard shot Kandahar as police chief general Abdul ... several times killing him that he sprayed the room with bullets smiley was hit twice in his looms Pentagon source is being treated at a military hospital in Afghanistan committed a grant Neely an American military spokesman in Kabul confirmed to NPR the journal smiley were shot\nBut said it would be no other details at this time adding\nWe will provide updates when appropriate news or general smiley was wounded was first reported by the Washington Post the\nAmerican commander ... did not release the generals name because of what it called privacy concerns the general was in charge of training advising the Afghan security forces in Kandahar\nThe attack also killed ... intelligence chief of dull moment in wounded governor Zalmay we saw initial reports from Afghan officials say the governor was killed\nIn American contractor and the coalition contractor were also wounded\nThe top American commander in Afghanistan General Scott Miller was unharmed who was leading the meeting when the gunfire erupted officials say the Afghan guard who opened fire was killed and it only been hard within the past two months to work for the governor\nAnd investigation is ongoing as officials provided more information on the Kandahar insider attack there were still another attack on coalition forces in the western ... one soldier was killed and three others wounded\nOfficials said they were not American but would not say which country they were from there have now been for insider attacks this year compared to one last year that killed three American Soldiers\nAnd they come as a Taliban has gained more ground in Afghanistan\nStill both Afghan and American officials were impressed with a large turnout on Saturday for parliamentary elections despite increased Taliban attacks voting in Kandahar was postponed until this weekend Tom Bowman NPR News Washington\n...

Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and what to do leave and you know\nOhio University is using this video dramatization [laughter] you ... can that drug known generically as a lockdown can reverse in overdose newly hurry Ohio University as one of many schools that make nor

resident advisors who've been trained yeah I did read I read it and\nI think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdosed good\nPositive another person's life\nStudents like Nick ... say it's comforting not just for the small number of people who maybe heroin users but also everyone using other street drugs like cocaine which is sometimes laced with opioids like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I've heard a lot of kids are where it goes that's when problems can definitely happen and an overdose can definitely be reality\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nDidn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago\nHis school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that but he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe cons to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJulian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strict\n... like they would send them on with condom junior encourage them to see first acts they can create like a fee for drug use can for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student was planning on studying for their exam that having no packing strips and their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd then the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus\nThe point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions not rock stone alone is not the answer colleges\nAlso need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose

elections\nSince then three million additional Californians received mail in ballots including people in five counties who send them to every voter for the first time so all that said Damien it's hard
