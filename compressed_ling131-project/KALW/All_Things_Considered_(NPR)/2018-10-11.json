the oval office surrounded by reporters and cameras wet spoken stream of consciousness passionate about everything from violence in his hometown of Chicago to prison reform to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery to his love\nOf President Trump let's give you a taste of what Kanye West had to say\nThere was something about\nFeel like ...\nFrom our bureau\nSuperman is his favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make complete total sense out of all of this hey I used to hello let's start with the why why with Tonya even there today\nHe was a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging complements for a while it it really picked up after ... war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat are they Saturday Night live to improve on or what I mean the liberals improve on it if you don't look good\nWe don't look good this is\nWhen was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump's claims that west coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like western brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him okay\nSo how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with them of West interests uh Kim car Daschle in with his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for\nWanting to bring on criminal justice reform what he seemed to talk about politically was that a about the free of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in the super max prison serving multiple life than it is\nA this was a case that is different from usually the case of that prison at Purdue form advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh\nWho had committed non violent offenses and ah maybe got really extreme sentences\nUh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for west and drop All right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I said thank you [noise]\nThis

solve other cold cases so young leave early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify\nHow powerful technique\nTo identify individual so Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify a relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in this debate as a beat Clinton\nHundreds of these ...\n... it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousin once removed\nAnd do stuff that they did to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system\nYou the multiples because I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need a geological record you need to do the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd early use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese picnic doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals as the technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe three episodes that could be either due to MIT\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police currency using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel K really he's foreign governments are going to exploited these techniques\nTo identify us citizens for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defend the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children\nThings like that it just [noise] [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West ... for lunch today one topic on the agenda gun violence in Chicago west told Trump he opposes stop and frisk police tactics\nThe president's ideas have differed greatly from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nA different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports\nChicago's had a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nMy of director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on a straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out the opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk ...\nThe widespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduces crime that conclusion contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty fifty in court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forums justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nThe general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore chose to do nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word as justice William loses stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric\nAsked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like have loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew in our lives those were the words from ... in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian it's the only use rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station sales during and today\nAt liftoff had proceeded and it was late for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd they have like five times a day when I my family out of the [noise]\nThe crew American the Hague and Russian Alexei of shame in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station and twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nStill this was going to be American Nick hate first time in ... the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was\nA test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this large\nThey went working together for a couple of years we rang out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely actor\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like this again I mean\nThe crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be cut them mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like gosh all that preparation will have that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again but\nI don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from it that like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it\nDesign problem manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now then no big deal but if it's gonna take a year or two years\nThen we need other plants bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different so I use that talked to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they on TALK and come home\nThan they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for joining us today nice to talk of the aisle so effective [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n[noise] one voter in a poor Kentucky Kelsey says she is doing well under President Trump and she says those still in poverty should work their way out

think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks
