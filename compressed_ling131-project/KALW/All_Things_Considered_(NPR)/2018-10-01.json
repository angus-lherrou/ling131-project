Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell promises that the Senate will vote this week on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court\nIt's not clear which day that depends on whether the FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh flatly denied claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about cabin on where this investigation stance he\nSaid a lot about Kavanaugh but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and cabin uh we've been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts\nHere the Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations President Trump seems to be referring to kind of Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible\nGraham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all of the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party and it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that Kavanaugh wasn't telling\nLike that off lake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a set of Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nThat undermines what what Ford said and backs with Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo\nFrom that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence a reasonable profit prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh at this point how\nMuch control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process well here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThey didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd you have to wait for those votes those three Republicans have a lot of power right now and

Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loading below basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going on\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers who'd have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about ... they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever website you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal where rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data just restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nA the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing that\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nHow the role the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office\nAnd the department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr

S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deal ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country\nThe most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt\nAnd ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nIs still expected by more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market that what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U.S agreed not to scrap NAFTA era process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico have reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday\nMarkets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly two hundred points Trump Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign the deal within sixty days just before ... leaves office it will then be up to the incoming U.S Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement\nThe president's trade representative Robert Lighthizer says he expects to be able to win back from a lot of Democrats as well as Republicans Celeste Drake who oversees trade policy for the AFL CIO says while she still has a lot of questions about the fine print the administration has been attentive to the

firsthand institutions advisors employers and individuals' choose T Rowe price T Rowe price invest with confidence\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know for\nChang and I'm Ari Shapiro there have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created\nOn how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in\nAnd get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books were not open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they had to stockpile is overseen in the department of energy so they're shocked there when the day after election\nWere weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside an apartment but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ministry she didn't have any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaigns for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service\nFrom communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it didn't even bigger problem and the person has an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme and his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for a loss of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit a\nSo those are people who have made a career out a lot of people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for tornado to come and take that bar I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or pay she wouldn't have to stare at the bar and any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her bart is going to destroy your house and she didn't watch that and I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now\nMichael Lewis whose new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California

winning let dot or [noise]\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deal but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president there sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still

that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the frogs case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area\nGo habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plant\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know ecosystems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina

fifty percent reduction in spine fractures\nAnd no sign of any serious side effects in fact the women getting the drugs were less likely to suffer heart attacks get cancer maybe even die\nSo I think what this means is that we can do to people we had these medications and if we can reduce the number is a more effectively\nExperts agree this is an extremely important paper that's Apple's Cyrus at Columbia the reason is so important is that we have an uncertain what to do with the great number of people primarily women over the age of sixty\nThat you can use that has been shown to work in such
