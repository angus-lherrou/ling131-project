democratic political figures next week\nAuthorities say five devices were sent in identical noble line manila envelopes each of them with the return address a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reported today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either\nOkay so take me through this the FBI says there were five potential explosive devices but they're also report more\nThat's right so the FBI says that these envelopes were addressed to George Soros he's a billionaire a big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nOf the package that was intended for Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right or not clear whether it was but\nYes there were other people who said they\nReceived ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however a package didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives another was California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nUS Capitol police said they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her they say it was removed as being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI did mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late I'm not clear at this point but the FBI did say that statement on Wednesday that it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know about at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in its announcement earlier\nWell law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the ones that the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder now the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed and these identical bubble rep envelopes the address is on the package\nAlthough her last name was was misspelled each package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individuals ah put stance on it but didn't have to mail it now\nThe package addressed a former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed the FBI says to the return a address which of course is Wasserman Schultz now she says today that she didn't send these ah she says she's deeply disturbed by these packages are disturbed that it showed up in that her name has been used and and all this\nAnd they said we have a number of targets you say there could be more out there where does this investigation come next\nWell the FBI says that these items that had been collected there on the way to a ... a FBI crime lab in Quantico, Virginia will be examined there there are a lot of federal agencies are as well as local law enforcement that are involved in this investigation on the federal side you have the secret service of course uh the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\nThe u._s. postal inspection services involved as well because of the mail service aspect of this you know FBI Director Chris

station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ailsa Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicide seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for men does\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and\nAlso that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nTortured Mesa middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to a law\nI don't think we're all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nOr how a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her son the crowded wall\nDeporting and positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just the way that they what they're going through and they don't feel like getting up\nLilley has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's got to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand\nJunction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote\nUpstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the front line some confidence that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband a suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear\nOr someone who is supporting you who had been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops but really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources\nIs in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator why are we focusing on you [noise] um well\nHave a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalyst to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the community will\nAnd tomorrow on MORNING edition or how the killing of Saudi journalist ... ... is being talked about in a wrong NPR's Noel King with

national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever him and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared
