the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this was who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is\nA when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of this is what I Am more than she does and I have no\nAnd says that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

beyond the two thousand and those guard troops were providing support duty switches transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... uh barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves who a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the officials say they\nOr their own leaders report roll again and the plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would it be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay the precedent for this job for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSo yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or the staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those

bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal attempt to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as

health care and the environment all things that occur Bello says he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling the truth\nOh okay that convincing voters who's

vegetable growers who were largely left out of the new trade agreement\nPeople like Republican tomato grower Karen Carpenter said that personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like the guy like that I mean it comes to listen and tries to\nDo something about the problem that affects state whose area\nAnd a festival you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but McCarthy Powell also worries that the people her party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism me not show up at the polls if we get our people to come out and vote I\nIt's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to to voting types\nThe last few days of the campaign will come down to who's message voters beliefs and it might help her bellows case that Trump himself is coming to Florida this week but not to campaign for her fellow that maybe just what he needs Kelsey Snell NPR News Miami [noise]\nMm [noise] you're listening to all things considered
