evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be\nRocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures\nIn Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up\nAnd now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an ...\nLook for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the ... in the\nMain and such a lock on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nI felt Sean I still feel Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans

performance explores domestic violence and the feeling of being held captive at home it's a collaboration with the women's HIV program at U. C. F. F. and the ... project which produces theater with incarcerated women how can theater help to heal the lasting damage of trauma\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging EPA say for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food road could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big has\nSaid you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you've ... place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the port so\nPretty serious ... some years of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape out the board has not without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as ... as sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor placement otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if you can't leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so that would be effect on all manner of European produces whether it's semi wine producers in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of the new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\nI think it's more of a lesson to be honest I I mean we all question why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that it's the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners say\nAnything could happen but I think my base assumption still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the ...\nThanks for joining us as always pleasure ... ... ... ...\n... ...\n... ... ... you're listening\nTo all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry but\nWhat should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosts the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we've tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nBut the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involve sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to depend on the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the ... so he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nSo [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same\nLevel of trust and accountability I think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks\nAnd so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company so what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increase revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may have backfired a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers oh\nEight flowers and candy to follow it takes on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I'm curious I think the main way changes\nBecause all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always just like oh you're just you're not be with

of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are are around you found in the midst of all and in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the metric based upon that\nSo just to persist shot there would be an issue about whether they use\nThe questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with\nThe enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLens ... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you wrote out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach the garage doors shaking\nIt was like somebody's trying to get in in the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I said everything was going to be OK Irwin last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a longtime emergency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach in other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida what I call the ... or not a bunch of high rises out a lot of construction this is all generational of or families of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings\nPlus per hour several years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's spent the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out directly yet Michael back and it's going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be\nProven suit you it is the way the community is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will all have a voice as Florida
