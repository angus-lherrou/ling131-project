Saudi Arabia to talk with someone about the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist journalist ... showed gee disappeared nearly two weeks ago after entering the shouting consulate in Istanbul\nTurkey says he was killed by a Saudi team\nWill today Turkish and Saudi investigators finally searched the consulate\nNPR's Jackie Northam is here to talk more about all the latest developments hijacking the way to start with the U.S stance here over the weekend President Trump was mourning Saudi Arabia about severe punishment his words if it were discovered that the kingdom had anything to do with the suspected murder of ...\nToday the president was using somewhat different words what's the latest\nWell yes you're right today um Trump said that he spoke to king selmont any firmly denied any knowledge about what happened to ...\nI Trump suggested that it could have been a work of what he called rope killers and this would make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin some on to stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president also dispatch secretary palm pay to react to talk with Saudi leaders and the search of the conflict today and it may be too soon to conclude is that these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nWhen I ask you about winning CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN fighting to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I I cannot confirm them at this time okay\nSo that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened the door for Saturday to try to we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight you're right they um they had this very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counter terrorism and there was a U.S political element to this as well certainly a Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices\nIt was a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America\nSo they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate ... that went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis planes had the journalists had left the consulate safely\nYou mentioned President Trump today said maybe this was the work of rogue killers um I mean so many people are saying this all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia having had a chance here where is that coming from what kind of reaction is getting\nUm well you know it's you know one of the two leaders are talking the Saudis in the U.S you know there's been growing outrage in the U.S and elsewhere about this in his sister Mary Louise has touched a raw nerve\nAnd it's likely there would be a revulsion if the truth seems to be obscured somehow I spoke with a ... of the committee to protect journalists and he said it could stay for any criticism of

Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this was an attempt to acquire a controversy that has dogged Warren for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either hey [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShould she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to Monday and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry but he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestor\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis one also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some then yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts them on the line\n... Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the euro rate is less than one of them\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nOne of the fact that we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least who one of members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were debate to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this I won't\nA million dollars\nFor trouble\nIf you take the test of the shows you're there\nYou know [noise] [noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay out the Illinois a million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war and went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the cheese are and I run for president herself and twenty twenty\nI think that's a really realistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had his taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty funny races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of those of us at ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick they report\nA miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All right so that is NPR's

to\nCorrespondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara Hi Mary Louise I'm real killers this was quite the turn of phrase do we know if the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly with the president is offering\nAn alternative theory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone but his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied it\nThis is very similar to what he did with let them or ... when he cited pollutants strong denials of any interference in the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo Rome killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy yet see okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can't keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural

Louise Kelly and Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the middle school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this window higher rates than men\n[noise] what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules\nAt rates we estimated often two to three times higher\nFor what prisons classify as smaller fraction\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing indoors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes it too late indicted appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat's Victoria Williams and it made up the central California women's facility and shout short of California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything
