weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint that changed completely last night when President Trump mocked forward at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you just don't remember where is the place I don't remember I'm going to go on\nAnd today the White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nOr just the motors versus a truce for the first\nNow he seems to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThan last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night but he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some of\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two chief senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nWell they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that\nAnd it's like why she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nOne of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so\nThe important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nHow his supporters react\nHis supporters by and large seemed to have stuck with him through the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful it remains to be seen exactly how people will respond in the long term to these cabinet allegations\nSupport for NPR comes from

Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will finish senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you are in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered\nThank you very glad to be with you\nTo begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the conscience for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there is some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in\nThe end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada the U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase\nIt's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA is it an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America and our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrators cost and we're going to have to work\nCosts because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association

S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and it's just and after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHa chess by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time VHS said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database that you agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd so then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nSo have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nVHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H.

hasn't scheduled and yet he and the rest of the Senate or waiting on the FBI to finish its investigation of sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh\nThree Republicans who could determine the judges fate say they need to see that FBI report first before they make up their minds with us now to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow\nAre saying the FBI could complete this report and send it to them as soon as today which would be early because the FBI was given a full week to do this does this speed to give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWell we got one clue on the scope just just a while earlier today we know now that the FBI has not yet talked to one key witness and that's Christine Blasey Ford\nHer lawyer say as of today she has not been contacted by the FBI a lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\nBy going over there we we heard from ever says\nOf course referring to last week public testimony a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar Democrats say this makes no sense of the whole point of following up was to confirm or dispel what Ford and Kavanaugh said so the FBI should follow up here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal who's a former attorney general\nLeads are followed\nThe interviews creates additional questions [noise]\nSometimes they re interviews that very common\nAnd that's an investigation it's got to be more than just check the box okay we have their accounts [noise]\nOkay so clearly there is a big

question is whether this time will be any different Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of those other key undecided vote today she indicated maybe it could be\nMy and taking everything into account and I think the president yesterday\nMy doctor for we're totally inappropriate and in my view unacceptable for taking\nEverything into account is is the key framing their Murkowski has made it clear she thinks a big part of this is treating women with respect listening tone to them when they come forward with allegations so she is certainly someone to watch if the president keeps attacking Ford head on\nAnd how many of these key senators said anything about the scope of the FBI investigation and whether or not hearing from either Kavanaugh or Ford again is a problem\nFlake said earlier that there should be about knowing what there is to know and trying to answer questions not checking a box as for the very latest little unclear because it's hard to talk to them right now because they're

believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain mix\nTropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had for the call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep we\nShare Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think\nI Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh Ford hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or New York times story you just heard it now says that Trump's were able to get away with the tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do sell\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nThat NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving the patients that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases where there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred

families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat ... to me that the state department of finance has been\nUtterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a ... on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe us as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that\nIt's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli
