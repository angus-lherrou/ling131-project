I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child not because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life has over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite the but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents did you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has a new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have rape partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News\nThat you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychics who take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business um what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls\nEighteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has been voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling this voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as depression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed or very very resilient and very determined to overcome it\nBut having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\nYou know ...
