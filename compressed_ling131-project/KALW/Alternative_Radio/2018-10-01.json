you know how\nThat was more so than you do with them about which at least for family lives in the opposite view just mentioned [noise] how's it going through all the financial power by the bankers making them\nMembers of the union was those if their beds seems it becomes thinking rich fading debate among [noise]\n... soccer is and this is alternative radio I'm David Box on me on this edition of a A R features Yahoo smuggled soccer's on how capitalism works\nThe latest phase of capitalism Neal liberalism has left the train wreck in its wake it's produced a new gilded age the gap between theoretical capitalism and his actual workings is jaw dropping\nThe chasm is a far cry from the courses and economics taught in colleges and universities\nWe are told the system relies on the market in fact it depends heavily on government intervention\nWhen the big capitalists are in trouble states are there to bail them out really existing capitalism works for the few at the expense of the many just look at the Trump tax cut\nEthic levels of inequality are not just in the United states but our worldwide and Oxfam report says eighty two percent of the wealth generated in two thousand Seventeen went to the richest one percent\nWhile three point seven billion people the poorest half of the world so new increase in their wealth\nOur guest today is young is not ... he's in the economist and academic he serves as the Greek minister of finance from January to July twenty Fifteen when he resigned\nHe's the author of many books including the global miniature and talking to my daughter about the economy\nHe spoke at town hall in Seattle and now young is not Osaka as\nCorporate and simulate fishery or two alien forces\nAnd the only thing that can bring some kind of the home be three corporate logic\nAnd economic and environmental and comedic stadium sustainability is the Democratic process whatever you can talk about you go back to the same issue which is\nGood for GDP communities the frenzy of democracy democracies most fungi flowers and it is constantly be trampled\nNow what we also forget is that democracy is something that these apps are deeply deeply despised by the powerful\nThe poverty never like democracy is an idea in the speaking of feeding him for a moment all the great to finance you know yesterday like later I just thought all\nThe lows\nLate or wrote that in public housing treaties Jay Z she was actually foaming at the mouth of the word out here\nWhich means in Greek some like more grown but you know you hear the word ... being used\nBy the powerful when they don't like the results of democratic decision making ... uh I just felt\nI spoke to actually ... interesting fellow because he gave us a splendid definition of democracy wide banging on the Democratic himself\nA and the different issues he gave wasn't said he said it it is a system of government where the many who are by definition of the pool\nComfortable governments if you let me conceptualize we won't\nGo see it like that you realize that really never had democracy in the west ever the many of the poor never controlled government\nHe'd be the whole point of the American constitution the very point of the German constitution of the French 'cause you're in the Greek um sufficient the whole point of our so called liberal democratic constitutions\nWas how to keep the the most out of the markets how to ensure that the people would never be in power\nThat they would be consult that's that that would be made to feel that they somehow controlled government without control\nIf you read the newspapers it's especially it it's all about checks and balances where checks and balances are not meant\nYou know to keep you know the executive from Tom pulling a rights or the rights of the ... to being defined no\nIt was all about how to make sure that the property that lights up at one percent of maintain that gave him all that might get the crazy idea and he's had a about the distribution of property by their lives over ... wealth and assets\nAnd indeed\nWhen people talk to me about China these days it's always slanted demographic yeah well\nWhat was the west they remember capitalism grew up in the nineteenth century in this country but also in Europe with the exception of England and parts of Scotland would have had to read the stuff that's\nEmerging at the end of the ... century\nLet me remind you that in the nineteenth century libertarianism\nWas defined as the ideology that would be bottom forty competing against the idea of democracy even somebody I Believe that a ... and a wonderful person ... you know sort of a\nVery good writer um defender of women's rights jumps to your meal the al ... was announced the Democrats\nHe believes that democracy was an all from the system of government and she did not encourage 'em one person one vote ever he was actually fighting against it so liberalism was juxtaposed against the markers\nAnd it was only the great financial crisis of the gun\nThe Eighteen forties and then we're ... we're charged in the Eighteen eighties and then immediately after about ten of the century the next financial can access which in the first decade of the twentieth century gave you the Federal Reserve\nAnd then also the Nineteen twenty nine he was only these processes I think they did buy financial collapses that\nCreate it's effectively\nPrice for the word democracy suddenly we started having these this this what used to be a contradiction in terms we talk about liberal democracy liberalism was against democracy the to wear like saying you know social acceptance\nLiberal democracy to some of the plant intellectuals the nineteenth century would have found that it's like you the the um ...\nHave the full about affect me what I'm saying that democracy has many enemies if we ever get the chance or democratic decision making process\nI either at the level of the town hall or the level of our states the liberal and federal governments we must count themselves lucky because that is so very few points\nIn the history now collected you see when we actually had something that his emulate democracy and you can see the incredible war against any vestiges of democracy anywhere where they are\nWhen I was in government in two thousand Fifteen I was struck by two things that are being sent by other powerful men and of course they were men and women are not that they said something that\nI didn't know which is one thing you know for us we'll see what our eyes and think big thoughts on auto he's quiet and one thing to imagine that this is what the\nMen said to one another whether or not it's actually hit with your own is like the kitchen and the two men that I'm defending the one who was about a ... bomber and the other was both from started with the German finance means I remember when I met Barack Obama in the white\nHouse is actually extremely nuts and very encouraging on a personal basis first thing he said and took me aback without he said look you arrive in your analysis we have never discussed before I was writing my knowledge about the ... how it had to be cops\nAnd this ... and the steady thing my company had gone farther pot and head when you look so completely right but you've got to compromise because you know\nThat are very few degrees of freedom in this world and before I said well I can say if the president\nI wake up in the morning and go to bed at night dreaming of compromise but I'm not going to be compromised is fundamental difference between the two and she's smiling you know you know he's and he said look when I was like I said I I'm I'm semi immigration\nAnd I go back to my hotel downtown Seattle\nAnd I I as a prank I tweets that tomorrow not stuck or the will stay stuck or change is going to collapse everyone's going to happen\nWhen crimes because people would be yeah\nEven if I did as a joke it will happen I can give you examples where you're gonna have a fantastic theory which does not so much for the diction does not materialize only because it became known so that's the opposite a good theory which is violated by the facts because it was good\nAnd it brought cod Duncan theory which was confined him just because it was made public see you see the difference nature doesn't give a damn about\nPredictions but so site the ease our predictions because society is what you and I do and what you and I do depends on what you and I believe\nSo if we be something and something will change with our belief that believe the change in really feeds into a different social and economic outcome so the phenomenon that we're spending as economists\nIntertwined in the city can be linked to our own feelings about it say comics his bottom of the phenomenon it tries to explain so we like you know attach chasing and sometimes that's what I can ever be science ever anybody who doesn't go\nTo the science is either the fool or just trying to fool you there's no federal ... and ... that is of course\nThe economists have never predicted any significant economic event in the history of captains\nAnd never will therefore\nIf there are no experts and the comics is not the signs what we do\nWe what we need to do we ... we need each one of us to become able to tackle economic questions with a degree of what\nThat means we have a ... a political and moral duty to become acquainted with the ways of capitalism is the system they cannot mix them we live in\nSo as to prevent the economists from holding us about how capitalism works for some people that that was fooling us on purpose or they need to fool themselves you know do what they're doing because you know it's a very boring life and the only way of\nMaintaining this um process of pseudo science is by convincing yourself of what you're doing science so but he's been with\nHumility with empathy who sympathy you know like lost children that they need your support\nWhat would you don't need is them to convince you that they know what is the answer to the headsets to Donald Trump's back Scott's corporate tax cuts\nTo the questions about the prime of change you as much of an expert as anyone else and this is the beauty of democracy\nBecause democracies Oscar Wilde\nIt's too long to many long evenings the same likes to democracy it's it's a pain clinic or you know I got involved in political processes back into thousands of feet and I can tell you that the find them extremely boring the whole the whole democratic process ease the pain sitting in parliament I suppose the same thing happen cnncom Chris\n... is ... ... ... ... not to do with politics by the way it's all the bureaucratic process buff as Winston Churchill said he'd be the best of all of its ... and here's how long have you what am I from the Sam\nIs the evolution the history of that has led to the society in which we find is\nThat once upon a time power\nWas one\nFear one rattling the lord of the land\nThe bottom the king ... in medieval Europe in the city had over power\nWas military ...\nAnd because he would consider to meet the power to get political power and the ends up men's he was rich which means he always had to make them\n\nHappy ... rapture of these units under your animal power split into two different realms the political and economic before that the weather you cannot didn't mean anything it's no\nHarvard University when he was set up Cambridge invested in Britain yeah all the great universities in the world didn't even consider having an economics reporter and by the way the comics not exactly what they called him he didn't mean anything\nWhen the engine which talks about the economic ... equals means home home economics means how to manage your house was then I can do with what we refer to them\nBut what happened was the victim of the bedrooms in England and Scotland\nWhich was necessary to replace them with cheap because there will be the sheets rule was valuable in the new international trade routes that had been established you'd do advances in Beijing and shipping\nSuddenly those Seventy percent of the president's where the victim witness for the isn't Britain you mentioned that they had nowhere to know\nSeventy oldest\nLabel is extracted from the land and they have to knock on doors from nearby villages and say I will do anything for the loaf of bread that's the first legal to my first time in human history when people actually selling\nThe labor selling it becomes ... and\nImmediately land became a commodity because suddenly we knew how much it was worth every acre because we knew how much will grow and think the last one was the price of who was the time and in fact nationally\n\nIf you throw into this mix Charles wants from Boston convention the steam engine yeah have you ever ... first factory but suddenly you have a new social class which is neither ... nor London loads\nThat have something called financial power or economic power so for the first time in human history the world of political power that animal political power and the ... is a split the merchants and the factory owners suddenly had begin to have\nPower money that they didn't have any more more recently\nHad another splits the economic sphere was dissected divided and multiply the game between industrial power and financial power so the ... ...\nSo this is what this has been happening and to us we are now eating in a world where the financial without going through all our lives in that field power\n... seconds and\nThe political sphere has lost all of our democracy is confined to the least bothersome sphere the political sphere and this is why\nThis ... flowers being crushed if you start thinking in those thumbs\nAnd then stop applying very basic ideas about you know how that few in profits\nSo that is to got to listen to that which had at least was founded on presence but absolutely essential for captains\nAnd how the control of financial power by the bankers makes them\nEffectively masters of the universe because if their bets ... succeeds they become thinking rich if they said you bail them out\nYeah saves them thinking in those times it's not difficult very quickly to acquire and economic expertise which if you look at it than democracy has a chance to give it a much [noise]\nYou're listening to young a slow to focus on how capitalism works this is an independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the book\nTalking to my daughter about the economy by calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven to one eight hundred for a for for\nNineteen Seventy seven\nOr you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org that's alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nAh my question is in evaluating how to use our resources effectively and how to empower people economically\nWhat is the use of economic analysis so using the head tax example\nMaybe they had to act with a bad idea that there may be taxing incomes as a better idea are trying to tax revenue in some way or the better idea so using economic to evaluate alternative auctions and decide on the best one\n[noise] but I think that's you know why don't we just try something that is not often be dried common sense\nBeginning most vague goals beget today and then probably Europe as well\nHad ruining the finance ministers of Germany did exactly want the Hoover many station did here they went to steady the minds\nOf Saturday and that is I was displaced price the gun to fall and on the climate of course balloons if you look at the\nElectoral results and I've done bumped a for instance you know local government elections as well as president elections environment and public silently you see as prices that eight different vision goes below zero in other words you're ever the ducks and in fact this suddenly the Nazi school from two percent\nTo eight percent Seventeen percent since the three percent in the space of Eighteen months that's what I'm saying that the nation breeds months that's in Greece\nMike I'm liberal country huh we\nHave a very proud that I could of having full ... to ... navy against not just in this country as we speak ladies and gentlemen the third largest spot in parliament they were sitting opposite me where am I mean it's the biggest said was out of Nazis beneath nuts\nAnd they\nSprung up in two thousand and two well just those prices were falling\nThere's there's no magic formula here I'm not looking for some kind of very sophisticated what I'm saying is very simple\nCapitalism to reach a stage where prices actually phoney and falling and I have to go see something it must have\nLost its within completely you know the the working class um he's facing unemployment and the same time you have small businesses who lose all gossiping because one passes for you know what happens\nIf ... let's say you wanted to buy a fridge refrigerator and then you can see the sky is falling why by today why not wait a few months and by more cheaply but he's everybody does with the democracy refrigerators dies huh so in Germany today\nGermany has benefited significantly from the European crisis in from a big crisis on paper\nIn the sense off a massive flight the money from the rest of Europe to the banks in Germany because people fear in Italy and Greece and Spain that our country's would get out of the European Union a lot of the you know a lot of the you know the common currency is that we would go back to\nAnd ... and inflates has gotten him see the news is value so they take their savings in the system to science you have a German Government has is that since ... and so on a cell phone at the same time\nOf Slate's I below zero\nSo what that does is that the bushes that eight different times of pension funds private pension France and Germany the negative rates so the average middle class person in Germany even if they have jobs mhm see their nest egg come down because interstate's a negative and\nThat has led to the rise of the will to not be for them it's a racist very right wing xenophobic policy that has gone from zero to ... percent in one year and now if it were elections today that we get ... percent so that's what I mean by ... breeding political moms\nSo I'm a little skeptical that just trying to make common citizen into a economic expert is\nGoing to end up in good results basically democracy is sort of an accumulation of everybody's self interest and in the accumulation of that hopefully you end up with a good policy but\nOn an economic standpoint it's I mean wouldn't you always be voting for a low interest rates and access to the cash register\nWhy would we get to the point where we would show um\nYou know and and ... understanding of the interplay of economics that would end up with the fact of posts say\nLook you have every reason to be skeptical a ... there's no way I can prove that you're you're wrong but that is also a reason to be skeptical about democracy\nBecause let's face it it's so easy to have people that are divided\nAnd each one of us looking after that own basically it'll into this or something that is as you put him and failing to get together in order to create collectively the concept of the common good and the common will it's so easy to face about it so easy\nTo become susceptible and victims of sensitive to the forces that plus the bug\nAnd allows to go what Margaret touches vision of society was that there is no such thing as society member when she said that in the Nineteen eighties and she mentioned philosophically in the same way she actually to your thinking or skepticism and turn it into philosophy\nShe lives about age and stuff from the fear of all how can the fear of the the agony of how can we pull together and create the common will by saying we towns and we shouldn't there's no such thing as a society we're just individuals and families that which is that\nIn that interview she gave the woman's own magazine that members I used to live in Britain\nUnforgettable it was a very courageous thing to say is completely ... percent profit\nBut at the same time extremely courageous I liked people speak their minds and it has an interesting philosophical really negative and logically pessimistic but nevertheless it's really interesting philosophical base\nAnd I I miss market factor you know why because she was appointed vision blacks who said what she believes in\nCase somebody may say that Donald Trump does to you from a review right you know it's called Mexicans rapists and he gets away with and she believes it to maybe go back to it whether we think\nThe reason why we don't agree with you frankly because if I Do then I Would not have the energy to wake up in the morning\nBecause you may be what you just said and its victims to basically there is a good chance you're right that I personally speaking this is my own personal statement I Will lose lose the will to live\nOK I'm I I don't know what I'm going to do I want to write another book was it\nTo be a mess but he has the silver lining or if you wanted a smidgen of hope that I went to ... says something about says things that\nDo you know why I'm optimistic about democracy is not the thing is to take them into finding what you make of each one of our imaginations there's no such thing as a self independence of one another\nYou see the leap into the buying the valley but I'm Single so the beginning wave someone's holds going to take you to join look speaking for the software for them is that you know these are some societies that individuals they are\nSome of the time and they are autonomous they know what they like and what they like what they do and they do what they like and all that yeah I Would like to do other things but they have constrains so the matter is an ex con springs to mind but if you in the ... I'm going to kill the philosophy\nSay guilty because the Scottish in there yeah um\nAnd then ... democracy is all about as you pointed synthesizing mind watching mines that itself into this with lets him in your ... doesn't find some kind\nOf a couple of days so that was an old be reasonably unhappy\nBut in a way that we're not best friends yeah yeah that's that's the that's the Anglo Celtic liberal position\nBut I think\nAnd the where politics comes from the west politics and the ancient Greek Democrats believe that democracy can only go in the corners\nBecause we have communities and self\nMakes no sense outside the policies if you grow up in the jungle on your own by some machine that looks after you know the Japanese have created these him as my ... my reasons and I can look up the children the elderly you know you could see that it could grow up in the John ... without any human\nBeing next to you you're not going to be human being you're going to be sent much you're going to be a very sad non human\nSo the only reason why you and I humans and we have a self interest is because we do it that ... that's another good work\nIn other words I could not know who I Am on the left side of the flex myself in your eyes and you buy some of us so myself into this cannot be defined as the primary if you're surfing through from where I come from from my last you know so in other words\nIt's all politics you know what the Illinois mosque understands as he said that it did not come from the ... eleven months it came from within in a mosque as well because it is out of socialization of functioning in the context of the foreigners\nBut he says the self interest each one of our self interest is to be fine collectively why can't we defined collectively what these in the public interest as well so", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01"}
