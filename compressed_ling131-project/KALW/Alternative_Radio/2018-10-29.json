failed system and you can remove from but if you don't address\nThe system itself [noise] then especially I fear as we barreled towards both an ecological\nAnd an economic crisis out\nSchwab will rise figures as frightening or more frightening\nThan Trump demagogues who actually have an ideology touching the American flag in one hand I'm a Christian crossing yeah we have to address the root cause\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David ... on this edition of a A R features Chris Hedges on root causes of a failed system\nWe live in an era where the one percent is raking it and we have a dog whistle politics bullying and disdain for science and facts\nSome saw this coming for example Neil Postman in his classic work amusing ourselves to death nailed it when he wrote\nWith a population becomes distracted by trivia when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainment's\nWin serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk when in short people become an audience and their public business of vaudeville act\nThen a nation finds itself at risk\nCulture death is it clear possibility postman wrote that in Nineteen eighty five or political life today is like a reality show there is a fascination with celebrities from Kenya west to the conditions to the former host of the practice\nAnd the soundtrack in the background is permanent war\nTo talk about these issues is Chris Hedges you shouldn't award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans in the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for a truce the dot com he's the author of many books including the world as it is wages of rebellion and America the farewell tour he spoke in Eugene Oregon and now Chris Hedges\nWell this is where our hope is right here in this room are with us and we have a difficult task before us oh one that won't be easy or that will require communal solidarity\nAnd self sacrifice\nBecause these corporate elites won't go without a fight\nAnd they will play dirty and they will be vicious and I'm sure I'm not the only one in this room who wasn't Standing Rock a great heroic effort led by indigenous communities [noise]\n\nWater protectors who understood that there are certain elements around us which are sacred which have an intrinsic value beyond a monetary value and which are worth fighting\nThe last few years\nI have written several books that have attempted to diagnose the deep malaise within American society the failure of our democratic\nInstitutions the bankruptcy of our political elites including the Democratic party the collapse of our press in debris or less\nThe shift away from a print based culture one rooted in truth and verifiable fact into a culture where fact is inner changed with opinion\nWhere\nWe are skillfully manipulated\nCorporate forces to elicit emotional responses to everything around us including manufactured political personalities and we confuse how we are made to feel\nWith knowledge\nThe problem in American society has been orchestrated by corporate forces by of corporate\nCoup d'etat in slow motion as John Ralston Saul points out\nWhich has transformed American society into\nA version of the late Roman Republic\nThe facade of democratic\nProcess electoral politics civil liberties a court system that defends the rights of citizens remains\nBut internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power\nAnd there's a great probably our greatest political philosopher Sheldon woolen taught at Berkeley later at Princeton\nWho writes in his classic work democracy incorporated\nBut there are no\nInstitutions left with in American\nSociety that can authentic we be called democratic\nThat we live in what he describes as a system of inverted\nTotalitarianism and by that\nHe means it's not classical totalitarianism we still have the iconography and language of the republic of a democratic system but the primacy of economics the ...\nOf neo liberalism which calls on us too Neal before the dictates of the marketplace\nJust structure our society\nAround the primacy of profit\nHas a centrally turn those institutions and the Democratic system\nInto a facade anytime a cabal seizes power\nWhether it's an article communist fascist or corporate\n\nAnd it read directs the institutions\nMade incremental and piecemeal reform possible\nLater concentration of wealth among the elite and amassing ever greater systems of power it fosters in essence political paralysis\n\nThe system works only for a tiny segment of the ruling oligarchy class and becomes increasingly oppressive\nSo the majority of citizens\nI wrote a book called death of the liberal class which is a study of liberal institutions and what has happened to them within American society and in the corruption and destruction of the liberal class\nWhich in a capitalist democracy should function as a kind of safety valve\nTo ameliorate the stresses and suffering within the society\nWe saw an example of this with the breakdown of capitalism in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd the response by the ruling oligarchy class under Roosevelt\nAnd Roosevelt in his private correspondence and the letter is published after his death writes that if we in the oligarchy elite do not respond we will get revolution those are Roosevelt words\nSo we must if\nIf the if the private sector cannot create jobs then we as government must create jobs and Roosevelt creates twelve million jobs Social Security\nMany of the union is who rose up in the Nineteen thirties had not been members of the union previously especially after the sole against unions following World War one that's how a functioning liberal class works\nThey put on the white shirt it would stop the white man's bullets that if they fell into this sue fee like hypnotic dance the buffalo herds would return the warriors would rise up from the earth\nAnd the white euro Americans and Americans would disappear\nAnd that is essentially what the Christian right is it is a crisis ... the only way to break the back of this movement is too we integrate these people back into the economy and of course the opposite has happened\nTrump has no ... it's an idiot logical void but\nThat vacuum is being filled rapidly by the Christian right the Christian fascists and as Noam Chomsky points out we may get rid of Trump\nBut Michael Pence will be worse\nNothing will protect us until we address the root cause which is the rupture of the social bonds the seizure of power by corporate forces\nAnd the deep lays an alienation that that is rippling across the United states we personalize our dilemma in a figure like from but this is a grave mistake\nAnd one of the saddest moments in contemporary American history\nHas been the Democratic party's refusal to address the social inequality that is driving us over a cliff [noise]\n\nBecause I figure like from did not a rise\nOut of this morass because of James Comey or the ... emails or Russian box\nBut the Democratic party is a creation of the corporate state there's one party it's the corporate party on one hand you have the\nFrog with diets and the race is the ... and the Sheldon Adelson Z\nAnd the trumps and the Bannon's in the middle or ... and the Kavanaugh's and on the other you have the segment\nOf the ruling corporate oligarchy embodied in the polish Princeton graduate work at Goldman Sachs I've taught at Princeton I see how they recruit who don't want to be identified as racist or homophobic or ...\nBut never addressed the structures of power the seizure of power\nBy these corporate forces\n\nTen years ago\nWe suffered\n\nAnd what was the response of the corporate elite\n\nThey created out of electronic ether according to researchers at the University of Missouri twin the six trillion dollars in fabricated money\nThink of what twin the six trillion dollars could have done in terms of putting people back to work making sure that the eight million families that were a victim from their homes had a place to live\nForgiving student debt creating a rational health system\n\nWhere parents were not forced by corporations to go bankrupt\nTrying to save their six children\n\nAnd the speculators these global speculators they took this money they never created jobs they never buttress manufacturing\nThey bought back their own stock which is what they did with the money they got from the virtual tax boycott never forget that under Eisenhower the highest\nTax brackets for the wealthiest individuals and corporations was Ninety One percent Ninety One percent [noise]\n\nAnd we now live in a system whereby next year we'll be pain\nOver three hundred and fifty billion dollars on interest and within ten years nine hundred billion dollars on interest\nAnd the gamble\nFracking industry aside from destroying the water\nOn which we depend for life\nDoes money losing operation\nTwo hundred and eighty billion dollars because the fracking industry like the dot com industry has value not on the profit it produces but I'm projected profit\nAnd this money this twenty six trillion dollars of money marks calls it fictitious capital because it will evaporate is borrowed that virtually zero percent interest from the fed\nIn Europe there were central banks that negative interest rates meaning they would pay to borrow\nMoney but it has to be paid back and since they're not producing anything of substance\nThey are imposing\nHarsher and harsher forms of austerity and debt peonage on a beleaguered population that no longer has a voice within the society\nWhat we have done to our students\n\nCrippled by monthly payments in the hundreds if not in the thousands of dollars\nOn able to find meaningful work\n\nProductivity since Nineteen Seventy three has increased by Seventy seven percent and if wages kept pace with productivity the minimum wage would be\nOver forty one million workers in this country earn less than twelve dollars an hour that's a third of the workforce and almost none of them have employee offered health insurance\nThat's by design\nThey are extracting it from us even if you have health insurance in this disastrous for profit system\n\nYour co pays what's not covered astronomical pharmaceutical costs are draining you\nA million bankruptcies a year\nAre caused by\nPeople who can't pay medical bills and they had insurance\n\nI'm not the only person in this room to read the climate change studies\nEach one more terrifying than the next and each one with the same thing which is it is happening far faster than we predicted\nWhy our climate scientist so terrified of raising global temperatures beyond two degrees Celsius because the feedback loops and they know what feedback loops do they studied it on Venus which used to have water and is now eight hundred degrees\nAnd these corporate forces Neal\nBefore the primacy of profit or not only willing to enslave us\nBut ultimately to push the human species to extinction\nAnd there are no internal or external mechanisms within the systems of power that will protect us\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on root causes of the cells

R. G.\nAll resistance now must be grounded in the spiritual\nNot in an orthodox religious belief system necessarily I come out of that system but I certainly saw that spiritual dimension at Standing Rock\nI'm not gonna play no stir dominance with dates but that it's coming is is a fact and the military machine has to contract and empires are always fragile entities because they depend for their wealth on the exploitation of foreign labor and the ... of foreign natural resources\nAnd you you saw you saw it in the feeding empire as the city's writes the tyranny that Atkins imposed on others that finally imposed on itself\nAnd that's precisely what's happening and you use the harsher forms of control and the outer reaches of empire a wholesale surveillance suspension of a basic civil liberties including due process militarized police militarized drones it all comes back into the heart of empire\nAnd and my fear and Cornel West and Rick Wilson I've been going around doing these series of talks based on great revolutionary thinkers rows of luck some bird Antonio ... Carl Marx WB to boys we did Thomas Paine for our first one because\nWe cannot separate ourselves from the wisdom of the past that is our patrimony that's our\nUm you know you can go back to Aristotle and Aristotle understood that you can't have a democracy in an Olive Garden system as Aristotle said once the oligarchy seizes power then you only have two options revolution or tyranny that's it\nAnd what I worry about this land of the eternal present and the land of images is that we're cutting ourselves off from our intellectual heritage at a moment that we desperately need it [noise]\n\nYou spoken up the need for spiritual awakening since humankind can't agree on who are father that's not politically correct God is or even whether we have a father do you think it might be time to remember\nOur well that's good our mother surely we all can agree that were children mothers well this is the guy or this is really the guy a theory by Lovelock\nUm that the earth is is a living being\nEvery society has a concept of God\nBut that concept is a human creation and they in doubt the eternal with particular attribute ... depending on whatever religious system you come out\nBut they all know that there is something beyond ... there is the internal there is the sacred there are these forces that give life and on which we depend for life\nAnd that our time on earth is very brief\nFor ten thousand years since the end of the last ice age and the very peculiar elements of the biosphere that have made this possible polluting the Gulf Stream for most of the four point five billion years the earth has been have not been exist\nIt's called the house thing this moment bean now supplanted by the anthropology so it's about being in touch with the sacred it's about\nHonoring protecting the sources of life and understanding that our life with a life around us is intricately linked\nWhat do you see is the role of third parties can we afford to risk wasting our vote in twenty twenty [noise]\nTo quote the great Emma Goldman if voting was that effective it would be illegal [noise]\n\nIf we don't rebuild our movements it doesn't matter who we vote for\nPower is the problem I agree I'm In that sense an anarchist\nPower is always the problem we are a terminal heretic a power we must remain organized hold power accountable as Ralph Nader has pointed out the last liberal president in America was Richard Nixon not because he was a liberal or out of conscience but because he was frightened the movements\nAnd there's that's how we got oh show the mining safety act the clean water most of it written by NATO\nAnd there was a scene in Kissinger is memoirs do not buy the book\nWhere it's Nineteen Seventy one there are tens of thousands of anti war demonstrators Nixon has put empty city buses all around the White House and he's standing at the window sane Henry they're going to break through the barricades and got us and that's precisely where we want people in power to\nBe [noise]\nSo I vote\nBut without movements real movements and my problem with Bernie is that and I ... I saw one and I were whiz Bernie before he announced\nAnd trauma was pushing him that he had to run as an independent not only are we not going to gain power through the Democratic party which doesn't function as a real political party and which stole the election from burning\nWe're not going to build an effective opposition within an election cycle it's going to take a long time\nIt's going to begin in places like Eugene that's going to begin from the ground up\nSo race or ten years ago now the ruling party breeze was pulling in four percent\nSo you know there\nDoes come a moment and we just have to stand up on principle because if we don't begin to stand up nobody else will [noise]\n\nWell that's a good question real solutions to homelessness but it raises the cruelty of what we have\nDone to people with mental disabilities um we have thrown them out on the street or you can see them twenty five percent of the prison population severely mentally ill and as soon as they get in prison they drug them up\nSo they sleep Eighteen hours a day because it's the only way the prison can cope is by applying them was psychotropic drugs but it's just\nExample of the cruelty of unfettered capitalism the way\nStill on the planet will discard people and treat them as if they're human refuse including of course children how many high school students are homeless how many college students I mean children living in shelters\nAnd that's why this system has to be\nOverthrown and let me spell it out for the homeland security that's O. V. E. R. [noise]\n\nWe have to restructure our relationship to the planet in our relationship to ourselves you know how many more decades can we go in without paying reparations to African Americans [noise]\n\nI've been in Germany and you know it's not a perfect society but they confronted the evil of the Holocaust and it made them a better society for it we've never confronted what we've done and let's be clear black people built this country [noise]\n\nNo everything has to go I mean education at all levels must be free there should be a guaranteed minimum wage there should be universal free health care for all [noise]\n\nThe fossil fuel industry and the banking industry must be nationalized [noise]\n\nAnd the military machine must be radically diminished\n[noise]\nYou know Eric Foner when he writes about the abolitionist\nSays\nThe abolitionist ... who had called for the emancipation of African Americans with no restitution\nTo their slave holders were dismissed as utopian us and Lincoln initially had all sorts of bizarre schemes of\nNot only compensating but sending blacks to Madagascar or I Can't remember where but\nWhat happened at the end of the civil wars that everything the abolition is called for came to\nPass we have to begin to stand up in a real way and not be cheering eyes by the practical\nBecause we don't have any time left to re create and we can figure our own society\nAnd that really means holding fast then of course they will attempt to frighten you but Trump is the creation of a failed system and you can remove Trump\nBut if you don't address\nThe system itself\nThe deformities within the system then especially I fear as we barrel towards both an ecological and an economic crisis out of that swamp will rise figures as frightening or more frightening", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29"}
