{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Nineteenth century the word Holocaust appeared in the New York times headline above a story describing the slaughter of more than five thousand Armenians in eastern turkey\nPart of an ongoing mass killing campaign they're\nHolocaust again appeared repeatedly during World War two as historian Peter Norfolk has observed in reference and I'm quoting of it to the totality of destruction wrought by the access not to the special faith of the Jews\nIn fact another points out only in the Nineteen sixties in the aftermath of the trial in Israel of the Nazi criminals out of like when did English language publications began referring to the Holocaust loosely translated reference to the Hebrew word Shaw like most people\nI commonly refer and speaking and writing to the Holocaust with exclusive reference to the slaughter of six million Jews and the Nazis massive extermination campaign but I don't believe it makes sense to expect word Holocaust suddenly to disappear from the English language following\nWorld War two except with reference to the Nazi today aside by the same logic we should be prohibited from using the word calamity except with reference to the Armenian Genocide where the nineteenth century Irish famine\nEach of which killed at least a million people any each of which has been designated in capital letters and in quotes the great calamity by their victims\nThe same logic would suggest that we strike the word devouring from everyday speech since that as the English translation of prime is to capitalize rama word for the genocide perpetrated against gypsies by the Nazis\nOther examples of genocide victims using a particular word to memorialize they're suffering of course abound\nIt just doesn't make sense to banish or word from everyday usage because one group or another has adopted in reference to their victimization\nAnd no doubt that's why my use of the word Holocaust not the Holocaust and referring to the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Americas actually was a very little remarked upon much more controversial as my use of another word\nThat word was genocide\nOne of the reasons that became controversial is that by employing it I was joining an ongoing debate about the uniqueness of the Holocaust\nNot talking about that debate the uniqueness debate shortly but first it's important to have some sense of why many people who knew nothing about that debate we're still instantly resistant to my use of the word the word genocide\nAmerican Holocaust was published on Columbus Day Nineteen Ninety two earlier that same year Oxford University press also published a book by the prominent literary scholar and cultural critic Jane Tompkins than of Duke University\nHer book was titled west of everything with the west referring to the American west\nIt was a sweeping in a wide ranging book that included discussions of women in the west white women at least popular western fiction buffalo bill and much else even had a separate chapter on horses another separate chapter on cattle\nOnly one thing was missing\nIndians the native people of the west\nHow could that happen\nTompkins address the question in her practice\nI forgot what she wrote us what she said I forgot\nTo be fair she did express regret for forgetting as she put it in a quota\nRemoval and conquest and now I had ignored them\nSo she wrote I cried and then she returned\nTo putting the final touches on her manuscript\nBut don't recount the story to be critical of Jane Tompkins but rather to suggest that her self confessed memory loss was representative and in some ways perhaps symbolic of the attitudes of most Americans and understandably so that's the way it's supposed to be\nConsidered this in the late Nineteen forties following almost three centuries of colonial and then federal assaults and Indians\nFrom mass murder land confiscation ethnic cleansing by way of forced removal and then confinement of the small remnant of survivors to what we're often Baron enclaves known as reservations\nThe American government decided to establish an Indian policy it officially called\nLiquidation\nWhen some people pointed out that in the middle of media aftermath of the world war two that term might suggest unsavory connotations\nThe government changed it to termination\nThe allegedly fine distinction between those two words the specific words themselves don't matter either one was fully appropriate to what was planned\nThe idea behind the new policy was to extinguish once and for all everything was Indian about Indians by abolishing their tribes in their treaty relationships well seizing what was left of their land\nIt was to be an extermination campaign not one aimed at individual lives but at the entirety of these indigenous peoples greatly varied and distinctive ethnicities nationalities cultures and religions all of which are tied to tribal identities and ... says\nThe Indians of course resisted this extermination campaigns just as they had resisted invasion of conquest and annihilation for centuries but in just a dozen years\nBetween Nineteen fifty four in Nineteen sixty six when the policy itself finally was terminated more than a hundred tribes and bands had been dissolved and more than one point three million acres of Indian land had been taken\nThat is the spirit of never forget\nThere was a wall in the United states Holocaust Memorial Museum inscribed warning something that'll Hitler reportedly said one day in Nineteen thirty nine on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland it's a famous phrase who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians\nMore ... than on this day I Believe nearly Seventy years later is another question\nWho after the crushing of Nazi Germany in Nineteen forty five could have imagined that the United states and Israel of all countries would help to perpetuate that convenient forgetful this about the annihilation of the Armenians and with it\nHitler's murderous cynicism on them to the twenty first century\nIndeed it was only a half dozen years ago that the current president of Israel Shimon Peres declared the Armenian Genocide Armenian Genocide to be historically meaningless\nThis prompted a particular the anger reply from within Israel by a man named Israel Charney the executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and genocide in Jerusalem\nIn a letter to Paris Charney wrote the parents said quote gone beyond a moral boundaries that no juice should ever allowed himself to trust is adding that specific remarks on the Armenian Genocide being meaningless were comparable to denials of the Holocaust\nThis sort of statement is not unusual for Israel Charney for many years he has ferociously fought back against the evil of Holocaust denial\nWhile at the same time resisting efforts to set the Holocaust apart as in his words I'm quoting him the ultimate an event against which all other tragedies of genocide a genocidal mass death or to be tested and invariably found wanting\nFor me he writes the passion to exclude this or that mass killing from the University of genocide as well as the intense competition\nTo establish the exclusive superiority or unique form of any one genocide ends up creating a fetish stick atmosphere in which the masses of bodies that are not to be qualified for the definition of genocide or dumped into a conceptual black hole where they are forgotten unquote\nWhich finally brings me back to the genocidal destruction of north and south America's native people\nAnd the strong resistance by some commentators to my use of the word genocide in describing the destruction\nCommentators like the recently convicted felon Senator Ted Stevens who threatened to use his considerable power to cut off funding of the Smithsonian Institution if used the word genocide as a plan to do in a documentary film on the destruction of the Americas native people\nCommentators in short who would prefer that those millions of bodies remain buried and forgotten in Chinese conceptual black hole\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the story of what happened to the indigenous peoples of the Americas during the course of four long centuries from Columbus is first landing at his bunny hill and fourteen Ninety two to the massacre at wounded knee in December of Eighteen Ninety or\nThe U.S supported genocide in Guatemala during the Nineteen eighties and beyond I must confess that it is impossible for me here tonight to describes specific events in any detail\nThat's what I did over the course of several hundred pages in American Holocaust and even then I barely scratched the surface of what in North America Alone began with a deliberate calculated extermination of the Indians or Virginia in the seventeenth century\nWhat yell genocide scholar been turned in recently described as a genocide on the court the Geneva and model so total destruction\nLet me just say for the moment however that the claim of euro American genocide is one of the primary agents responsible for the deaths of millions of indigenous people throughout the western hemisphere was hardly original with me\nIn fact the first person to make that case was the very man who coined the word genocide and who relentlessly and heroically press the United nations to declare it an international crime a law professor of polish Jew who would last forty nine members of his family in the Holocaust roughly ... ...\nIt's commonly thought that in his efforts to name a defined genocide as a crime Lincoln was posted focused exclusively on the den ongoing extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany and this is incorrect\nRecent research in the Lincoln are types of New York's American Jewish Historical Society the New York public library and the mark the center of the American Jewish archives in Cincinnati has revealed the existence of detailed manuscript ratings from the Nineteen forties\nAnd which Lincoln obviously preparing at least one book on John genocide probably more\nLess numerous folders filed under what he regarded as a variety of genocidal events in history including the titles are his quote Spanish treatment of South American Indians North American Indians colon extermination\nHistory of genocide projected book on North American Indian research and much more\nIn the Nineteen forty eight report to a foundation that with supporting his work Lincoln listed what he called ten specific genocide cases justice phrase he used a which was compiling information and I quote to be made available to the United nations drafting committee on genocide\nOne of those ten cases is labeled the Indians in Latin America another is the Indians in North America\nAnd then finally in the Nineteen fifties Lincoln's archives reveal still more folders bulging with information on these subjects including the draft of a one hundred page essay on genocide against Indians one that includes sections on their incarceration in what he calls concentration camps\nHe was of course referring to reservations\nBy the late Nineteen fifties Lincoln had almost completed a massive book on genocide world history\nThe entire third section of which was to be given over to genocides and colonial settings with separate chapter titles listed on genocide against the American Indians Latin America\nGenocide against the as tax the Yucatan genocide against the Incas and then on to European genocides against the natives of New Zealand Australia south West Africa and more\nBut in Nineteen fifty nine Lincoln died of a heart attack in a hotel room in New York City he was not yet sixty years old the book was unfinished\nBut even if it had been completed it probably never would have been published because by then a new orthodoxy was beginning to take hold in the United states and elsewhere when that view the Holocaust as a singular unique genocidal events in world history to some proponents of the sites\nIt was the only genocide whereas Lincoln apparently felt that acknowledging the suffering of others had no bearing on the recognition of one's own painful experience\nSome among this new generation regarded the Holocaust as moral capital to psych one representative writer moral capital that risk to being plundered by others who sought acknowledgement of their own horrific experiences\nAnd this emerging climate of opinion authors who chose to honor even mildly critical comments about aspects of the new orthodoxy including ... distinguished Jewish political theorist and historians is Han aren't in the ... he'll bird\nFound themselves being abused in print and black balled for expressing their points of view\nFor the better part of three decades this sort of exclusive is thinking dominated scholarly discussion about the Holocaust\nSo much so in fact than in the early Nineteen nineties the distinguished Princeton historian or know Jane Mayer himself a Jew found his classes being boycotted by Jewish students and his name placed in a robes gallery of so called ... Hitler apologist published by the Anti Defamation league\nHitler apologist why\nBecause in the book is titled why did the heavens not dark and mayor had dared to criticize what he saw as two camps of historical extremists\nIn his words and I'm quoting him those two camps were revisionists who categorically denied the Judeo side and dogma tests who seek to ... and ... the Holocaust\nIn his letter camper numerous prominence scholars who vigorously condemned anyone who dared to engage in comparative genocide research\nResearch for one such author that might tape the Holocaust bite including it as a merely and I'm quoting one among the ... an array of other conflict rations in which innocence were massacred unquote\nHolocaust is unique it stands alone nothing can be compared with it\nSo said those scholars professor ... criticized as whole the cause of it is indeed according to historian Stephen Katz reading in the Nineteen nineties the Holocaust not only is unique is the only true genocide that has ever occurred\nDust when asked in Nineteen Ninety four what he thought of the recent an ongoing mass killings in Bosnia and Wanda\nCats replied that the Bosnia situation was merely and I quote a population transfer supported by violence unquote while the slaughter of eight hundred thousand people over the course of three months in Rwanda was he said not genocidal but simply a struggle for tribal domination\nSo you said at one point that the American Holocaust is as advantage to pass the wreckage from it as something that we're still dealing with today and this is maybe I can\nI'm like push you on our little back 'cause I'm Wondering if maybe it is the case that it actually is something that ... I'm In the sense that not you know we don't see government forces going out and flattering in a typical fence and indigenous communities but\nIn a way we've seen colonialism work so well that now that have anything to enforce it playing out and doing it actually made it so that communities are very very good at kind of exterminating sell 'em\nBecause I'm thinking in terms of North American reserved communities that have the highest rates of violence and all the other side alcoholism and drug dependency I'm incredibly low literacy rates and also kind of just they widespread ability as like mainstream society to make all of those things and there's an old ... certainly don't come out\nUm said we don't actually talk about them so that we can talk about\nRace and racism without actually talking about indigenous people at all and so I'm Wondering if maybe you'd be willing to say that it's still going on or if there's a particular reason why okay\nAnd you know I Would take issue just one thing that you said and it may have just been a a term that you would not maybe perhaps I wanted to use or maybe you do\nYou suggested that somehow or other the system has become so efficient I think that's not your word or phrase but the the people were doing it to themselves are destroying themselves and to me\nThe ... very close to blaming the victims of ultimately they're not doing it to themselves even those who are committing suicide I think are not doing it to themselves again that's a fine point I think but in saying that what I'm really saying is that I agree with you\nOn that yes this has become a kind of machine the goals of itself in the same way that we can have deeply racist society without any overt\nEvidence of hate speech um and and racial hatred apparent\nOn the surface of the society because we've created institutions that the ... or institutionally racist and simply take care of business on their own with or without all the rhetoric that was associated with racism in the past so I agree with that\nI guess the the distinction that I Would make 'em because I did conclude American Holocaust at the end of the nineteenth century although I did make references to um the killing in Latin America in the Nineteen horrible horrible genocidal killing Latin American living eighties comes back to the costs\nYears of trying to figure out some historians just tomato definitions of genocide and the reason they made up Jeff ... is because the genocide convention the United nations was cobbled together by a group of nations\nTo somehow make sense of and to to institutionalize a law that would say this we cannot have this anymore this is illegal and nations must act against it so in order to do that they had to define it\nThe problem is who is sitting around defining this\nPeople who represent countries that in the past and at that time were committing genocide and when it was like having the thieves sit around the table right the writing the law\nSo for example a Lincoln had always had in his definition of genocide whole groups of of political of people who would who were being exterminated because of their politics the Soviet Union had would have nothing to do with that because they had how many people\nIn the gulag at the moment that they're sitting down reading this this this genocide convention they simply could not have that as a result technically\nThe genocide in Cambodia was not genocide and they're very very few genocide scholars who will say that it was genocide\nBut most of the genocide scholars in the world today would say if it was horrible but the victims were political victims and that's why it's not a genocide same thing with the killing of Indians and part of why\nThe the killers weren't able to extricate themselves by saying yes we kill all of those people almost exterminated on tire people\nBut it wasn't because of the fact that they were Indians which would have made them a protected group but because their political activities were such that we they deserved being exterminated and therefore yes maybe that was not very humanitarian and maybe it was a crime against humanity and so and so forth but it's not genocide\nAnyway that's one of the reasons why historians have tried many historians\nAnd sociologist right above just I have tried to create their own definitions of genocide the problem with that is\nYour definition includes this group my definition includes that group such as um taking children as the United nations convention those taking children away from families and putting them among others as as happened in Australia most famously a and so on and others don't so therefore then you've lost everything\nSo I think that really what we need to do and I hate that I don't like this because I think the genocide convention as real problems\nIf it would just simply have to hold to the un genocide convention it's the only one the only thing that the definition that exist that most people have bought into\nI guess what I'm saying to come back to your point which I think is a very good one is that I think we should stay within the un definition and fight about issues within that\nAnd in that case then we have to accept the word intent however we define it as part of the justification for our use of the term genocide\nEffects are like I think that I'm thinking of the things that happened I I find as I say\nHis sermon he hadn't seen her face and I've really large wave I didn't ... when I I'm not sure it's all die\nLike if you look at the ... the uncanny and so I Know they're in a folder full of cat and a lot better but you know getting ready to read it as a slum policy I'm not sure that you can fall apart they intend to exterminate methane\nA case can be made that the genocide convention does cover them and uh uh uh people have written about that will do that and again in Australia particularly\nAs as somebody who is Native American\nChurch in Muskogee basically my family all ran off during the movie\nAnd hit out I've lived on three different reservations and\nMy kids are all members of federally recognized tribe [noise] when you're looking at genocide as as a native person\nThere was a physical genocide [noise] there is the fact of genocide\nI grew up right here in Nashville and I grew up around mainstream society being a person from a completely separate culture\nAnd having to deal with\nWhy can't you just be an American why are you still speaking that language\nAnd the school still do this my kids have had to fight the very same fights in school that I had to fight that my mother had to fight and so forth and so on where\nYou get one little chapter of maybe four pages and a few paragraphs and it's so gentle it's useless it talks about the aesthetics it talks about the southeastern people and my aunt may mentions the Cherokees and the creeks it talks about the northeastern people and it usually mentioned some all hawks\nAnd it mentioned Lakota and um\nIt's just useless it's not taught people don't understand that three fifths of all the rules food crops were developed right here in the western hemisphere\nMost of the medicines that most people use came from here we were not only the greatest agricultural is on the face of the earth we're also the greatest pharmaceutical button\nNow some of it the the alcoholism the drug abuse of a dysfunction that ah it's just within families a lot of people wouldn't know it and I hate to admit it but sexual abuse among Native Americans is astronomically higher than it is for the rest of the population\nIt started with the boarding schools are residential schools because you had kids that were taken at the age of five they didn't see their families for seven or eight years how can you be normal when you're not raised in a family when you were put into boarding school\nAnd you are beating for speaking your native language\nYou're mistreated you're sexually abused Everytime they ... they go to an old old boarding school site and they start excavating because somebody's going to build something else they start finding skeletons probably twenty five percent of Native American children who went into the boarding school disappeared [noise]\nAnd they were never found those are people who never got to grow up and never got to contribute and we weren't putting those boarding schools to make us doctors or lawyers or leaders we're put in there so that the girls could become domestic servants and the boys could become manual
