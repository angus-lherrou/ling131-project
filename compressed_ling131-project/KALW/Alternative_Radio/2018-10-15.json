{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Idiot station and online and KLW that O. R. G.\nIt's one o'clock good afternoon [noise]\n\nThe seizure of our political system white global corporations just depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront once before us including our ... democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist anyway that's a kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world than comes afterwards and even if we fail and we made for him\nBut even if we found a at least a lead those will come after us and they try and if we are passing in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel con when called radical even [noise]\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David by Sunday on this edition of a A R features Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nWomen's enough enough in the face of evil what does it take for people to move and passivity to active resistance\nThroughout history there have been instances of people they find tyranny fighting back no matter what the odds an example comes from Nazi Germany often considered the benchmark of evil opposition to the regime was highly dangerous\nSeventy five years ago hands and so the shore brother and sister and others at the University of Munich said good new enough\nThey formed the white rose movement and cold on Germans to recognize their moral duty and overthrow the government they disseminated critical information through flyers and graffiti one such graffiti said whatever comes out of Hitler's mouth is ally\nIn Nineteen forty three hundred and so the show were arrested and beheaded their resistance and courage on there today they took risks can we\nOur guest today is Chris Hedges he's an award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for truth the dot com he's the author of many books including America the farewell tour I talked with him in the studios of KGAN you in Boulder, Colorado\nWelcome to the program Chris Hedges thank you David well why a farewell tour because this is the end of American empire a and\nAll of the warning signs that exist when empires disintegrate are flashing red\nUh the expansion of a military machine a that is Halloween the country out from the inside\nThe erosion of civil liberties the D. industrialization of our cities the capture of our political process by a tiny cabal in this case corporate that re directs all of the institutions\nThat once made reform possible towards the further consolidation of power a and amassing of obscene amounts of wealth\nThe political system no longer functions is at least in terms of\nPropel in a society forwarded its its role in that society backwards as we enrich this tiny global financial elite and a which is largely orchestrated attacks boycott they pay little to no taxes ... Eisenhower or the wealthy\nNow they have to extract that money from a beleaguered population\nThat's why you get programs not only of austerity but debt peonage a student at one point five trillion dollars\nHousehold debts over Thirteen trillion you're late on your credit card that's twenty eight percent interest or you're going to poor communities and they're just fine to death for the most ridiculous offenses\nIncluding obstruction on pedestrian walkway is what you mean standing on a sidewalk not mowing your lawn which is actually a fine in Ferguson, Missouri because with the loss of tax revenue these counties and states\nCan't fill their budgets and because that\nOligarchy elite has rendered themselves untouchable a and we can watch massive acts of fraud by Goldman Sachs or banks and nobody's held accountable than the uh the system for its pound of flesh takes it out of the most vulnerable\nIt's from the symptom of something much deeper\nYeah Trump is a symptom of a political system that has seized up and doesn't work\nUh and that's why we're seeing Trump light figures appear\nThroughout the industrialized world Viktor Orban in Hungary or ... or ... or Boris Johnson in Britain you know the polish government just destroy their legal system the sweetest elections just brought to power these are the right wing nationalist\nBecause in essence this global financial elite have seized control of national economy as we see it in Greece and it it the citizens have a lost the ability to determine both economic and political policy\nUh and so the debate has shifted in and Thatcher and Reagan were largely responsible for this it shifted\nA towards an assault on national identity um you know they're the idea that uh uh eleven million undocumented workers are somehow responsible for the economic decline of the United states is patently absurd um but it works when you have\nCorporations controlling your media platforms and there was no rational discussion of corporate capitalism or how it works a and as we move closer towards the financial crisis and one is coming another one\nUh you will see that kind of language and incitement to violence which Trump has already done be ratcheted up\nWhat are the signs of coming economic crash you mentioned that well\nSo what happened after two thousand and eight is that the banks and the global speculators received at virtually zero percent interest twenty six trillion dollars according to the University of Missouri of fabricated money out of electronic\nEther what they did with this money was not invest it in the society\nThey didn't build new factories create new jobs the way of traditional capitals structure with\nWhat they did was hoard it by back their own stock\nThat's what they did with most of the money from the tax cuts because their compensation packages are tied that's why the overheated stock market the idea that that is somehow symbol of a healthy economy is absurd\nUh\nThey invested it and very risky ventures like fracking so fracking the the the value of the fracking industry is determined not by their profits in fact it's a money losing operation almost all places\nAnd they've had to borrow a tremendous amounts of money over two hundred and eighty billion to ...\nOn projected profits but at a certain moment that bubble burst a estimates are that within a couple of decades forty percent of the the people who have student loans will have defaulted um the system's not sustainable now what happens\nThis time around is that the elites don't have a plan B they can't lower interest rates anymore they've already lowered them which is virtually zero I'm In fact central bank some central banks in Europe were lending money at negative interest rates they would pay you to borrow money\nAnd\nFlirt with what will be the death blow of the American empire and that is the\nDay the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency and why is that significant well because then the dollars value collapses completely I mean it's a fictitious value as it is a but it's it's held up because it is the world's reserve currency it's remains the world's reserve currency we saw\nA ... an example of that when in the Nineteen fifties the pound sterling was dropped as the world's reserve\nOne of the characteristics of late empire is that it makes disastrous military\nDecisions military fiasco so ... in the the the Indian Empire the in in ancient Greece they attempted to invade Sicily their entire fleet was sunk\nAnd uh most of their soldiers were killed ... centigrade it in fifty six Great Britain attempted to invade Egypt after Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal\nAnd had to retreat and humiliation and that led to the pound sterling being dropped as the world's reserve and that they were finished\nAnd our greatest strategic blunder\nIn American history has been the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan Seventeen years of warfare\nOr they're not winnable conflicts in fact the Taliban control is more territory in Afghanistan then when we went in there is no way to extract we've just created one failed state after another whether that's Libya Syria Iraq as a unified country doesn't exist anymore\nJournalism I mean what our politicians are you know like Bill Clinton or ... they're manufactured personalities there's no substance it's a remember the old\nClash or\nCampaign between a Al Gore and Bush who do you want to have a beer with I mean this is insane [noise] but ... they're very skillful the public relations industry which was arguably one of the most evil industries in America and making us confuse how we are made to feel with knowledge\nAnd that manipulation now courtesy of handheld devices just goes on twenty four hours a day\nOr and we are uh I think is a\nForce to and wrote that probably the most illusions society in human history meanwhile we are being impoverished stripped of our civil liberties or have amassed\nAn oligarchy ... elite that you know rivals that that existed dumb and I think is great into in terms of income inequality is worse than what took place under the gilded age and you can't maintain a democracy in an oligarchy that isn't a particularly sophisticated\nPolitical thought Aristotle a\nElaborated on that or some three thousand years ago\nWho didn't Louis Brandeis the Supreme Court justice and you can have a you can have two things you can have a democracy where you can have great concentrations of wealth that you can't have both\nRight and it Aristotle said that you know when you have that income inequality then you're only two choices are chairing a revolution\nLet's go back to ground see again because you write in your book that he would have been spared of the divide in the United states between our and you make a left and the working class\nWell\nSo I mean we had radical union movements and the ... the old CIO the old United mine workers\nAnd that\nIn the name of anti communism or the red scare they were if this rated especially in the Nineteen fifties after World War two and Alan ... written some good books on this\nWhich worse there was something she roaches a historian on that period that I didn't know I mean that that it didn't it wasn't just the Hollywood writers and Pete Seeger and dome trombone\nUh but the FBI was going into high schools with lists of quote unquote reds with no evidence\nUh and then these teachers were fired and blacklisted they couldn't work again it really is at the all through the layers of society they were purging people with a social conscience critics of capitalism\nThe effects of that were quite devastating\nUm we saw a a rise of movements in the Nineteen sixties and then this contemporary ferocious assault\nOr which began in the early seventies and Louis towels memo uh attack on the free enterprise system is kind of the blueprint for that Nineteen Seventy one Nineteen Seventy one and so from that point on word labor\nSo called right to work laws a further attack on unions only six percent now of the American workforce in the private sector is unionized at all\nBut with a right to work law employers can't even make contracts with unions are it it really expands the ability of employers to hire exclusively non union labor and so this re configuration of American society a is one\nWhere we have been left virtually defenseless as these forces role forward and and you know it was Carl ... rights and the great transformation\nA unfettered unregulated capitalism is ultimately a destructive and a self destructive force because commodity size everything we haven't even spoken about climate change it it can modifies human beings than it modifies the natural world in the name of short term profit\nOr until exhaustion or collapse and and there's no constraints anymore uh and part of the ...\nI think what all of us who read climate change report sphere\nOr is that these elites are are utterly and capable of responding rationally to the greatest existential threat to face the human species or it isn't just Trump I mean you know Trump's of climate deniers but the whole month for that we can somehow adapt\nOr the Paris climate accord which are nonbinding ah you know limits on carbon emissions I mean all of this fails to confront the gravity of of what's before us\nThe question always comes up you know these corporate managers they know the signs me getting reports you know accurate information and they have children and grandchildren so how can they be acting in ways that are endangering on their own families well\nBecause in order to become the CEO of BP um you probably have to have a psychopathic personality um these are not I I went to school with him unfortunately I was shipped off to exclusive boarding school\nAt the age of ten where is that New England evil broken and women's\nUh on scholarship so I grew up with these people uh you know I went to school with Louis Scooter Libby I Know who they are I ... I went to I Know them all and they are a incredibly entitled incredibly narcissistic\nUm they believe that their wealth will protect them\nAnd they are in gay gene in behavior that\nIn the short term makes them wealthier and more powerful and I don't think they see beyond it you know by the time you reached that level you are so winnow doubt I mean you don't you don't get I mean I worked at the New York times for Fifteen Years and\nThere's a kind of vetting process where those who rise within the New York times or any corporation do so because they exhibit a loyalty to the institution knocked to the individuals who work for it or the individuals that are exploited by it\nAnd that is a very distorted personality but institutions\nAre quite good at selecting those who who will Neal before its alter\n... and you know and I come out a seminary I mean that it is a form of id ... tree and we were taught in seminary that the danger of idols is not just that it demands human sacrifice but in the end it ... it demands self sacrifice that your finally\nSlaughtered on the altar and that's precisely what's happening they they think they're going to a skate but I mean you've got these silicon\nAnd the missile silos and the mid west where they think they're gonna ... I can tell them from from covering the former Yugoslavia that the people who rule when society breaks down or those who have the guns are and their body guards are not going to sit around and take orders from them once society disintegrates\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on rise up and resist this is independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the Hedges book America the farewell tour\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven that's one eight hundred for for for one nine seven seven or you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org\nThat's alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nI Want to draw a little bit on your studies of the Christian evangelical right in the United states you you wrote a book called American fascism the Christian right in the war\nOn America large numbers of evangelical Christians in in this country are on national and servants believers in capitalism eighty one percent of them voted in the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nUh for Donald Trump thrice married casino mogul who has a pension for ... and ... with porn stars and playboy bunnies how can they do that\nBecause they're cut from the same cloth live maybe this distinction of the white men who run most of these mega churches have sexual proclivities that are probably can't care than Trump um I find this whole question of\nHow can the Christian right support Trump to be an utter misreading of the Christian right I spent two years without\nA this is a movement that and I speak as a seminary graduate is heretical ... their Christian heritage six they have the culture rated the worst aspects of American imperialism and capitalism\nInto the Christian religion they sack realized it and uh you don't have to spend three years at Harvard divinity school as I did to figure out that Jesus didn't come to make us rich\nBut that\nA marriage of the iconography and language of religion of the Christian religion all you see it with Modi in India of any religion with the state or is a recipe for fascism\nAnd when I was at Harvard divinity school my great mentor James Luther Adams or had been at the University of Heidelberg in Nineteen thirty six I'm thirty seven\nPeculiar world views may be different and even repugnant to ours um but no I spent a lot of time with these people and ... you're just not going to our I mean the the whole I took a creation a seminar and so this was a class for\nA teachers and Christian schools how to teach creationism\nAnd they ... the instructor had to confront the fact that uh\nYou know the world is created in the first day but lights not created till the fourth day so what do you tell the students while you tell the students that God created a temporary like I mean it's all in the details it's ridiculous it's not in the Bible it's completely fabricated\nBut it shows you how just connected there ... is from reality and that's just you know on every single level\nOn a whole range of a public issues from a protecting environment to universal healthcare to having tuition free colleges and universities\nThese are all according to polls including one commissioned by the Koch brothers majority ... heroes yet the political class does not move forward on them why not\nBecause we don't count because we've all people know legislation we know statistically I mean legislation and laws are written by corporate lobbyists and we've been utterly different power we've we live and what Sheldon willing called a system of inverted totalitarianism and by that he means it's not\nClassical not yet not classical totalitarianism or it's not gonna stop all in death camps\nWell and it's not a a Hitler Mussolini I mean I don't think Trump has reached that point\nSo you have the facades like the late Roman Republic you have the facade of the republic but internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen input at a really it doesn't matter I mean it doesn't matter cabin uh commits\nPerjury I mean there's not no question he goes right on to the Supreme Court I mean it's remarkable uh the laws don't matter or at least for the rich uh and then you have a criminalization of poverty\nUh so you know mowing their lawn\nOr not mowing your lawn or standing on a sidewalk which means obstructing pedestrian traffic or or having an open container your find and jailed why because these county and state governments\nBecause nobody pays taxes and under eyes and how the wealthiest corporations and and uh individuals paid Ninety One percent\nTax or they don't have any revenue so they're they can't get it from corporations\nThe vulnerable so the pressure on the poor and the working poor is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and there were powerless to do anything about it because the system whether it's the Democrats are the Republican the established elites are beholden to corporate money\nGrump she used to say and it's often quoted by Edward ... and ... and others saying that he had pessimism about the intellect and optimism of will or is this something that appeals to\nYes because I mean people say well you know it's so bleak it's so depressing well it's bleak and depressing um and I think the greatest existential crisis of our time is to grasp what's before us from climate change alone\nWhen if we would stop all Carmen missions today which were not doing we would still suffer catastrophic climate change\nAnd one of the reasons that climate scientists are so terrified of going beyond two degrees Celsius in terms of global warming is that they know from studying other planets like Venus which once had water and now is eight hundred degrees that triggers feedback loops which you can't control there's nothing you can do that\nAnd they've run mathematical scenarios on those loops that range from Seventy percent die off of the human species to complete extinction\nLots bleak and it's depressing um the seizure of our political system by corporate power global corporations are is depressing\nAh you know the fact that sixteen million hungry children go to bed and America every night is depressing as if the fact that we have to point three million prisoners twenty five percent of the world's prison population over half of whom were never charged with physically harming anyone is depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist any way that it's a kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world that comes after us and even if we fail and we may fail but even if we fail at least let those will come after us say they tried a and if we are passive\nIn front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel conned would call radical evil\nIn Nineteen eighty eight the NASA scientists James Hansen I went to Capitol Hill and for the first time\nI talked about a ... what was happening with the climate see sowing increasing warming of the earth's temperature and the potential dangers that that may pose a down the line well here we are Thirty years later\nWith the U.S pulling out of the Paris climate agreement accord with even with all its problems\nAnd we are rapidly hurdling toward the abyss\nWell climate change was first identified as a problem in Nineteen oh five\nNineteen sixty five right\nNo Nineteen over ... over yes it was a scientist in Europe I forget from Sweden or somewhere down a fight it\nUh but then you had acts on their scientist in the seventies understood the nature of global warming edits danger so it's we've known for a long time the elites have certainly no uh but unfortunately they chose their own\nPersonal profit and the prophet of their corporations over human life uh and\nThat's why I don't hold out any hope for the elites I mean we have to remove the system from power\nA we have to overthrow the corporate state and that comes through mass acts of sustained nonviolent civil disobedience such as we saw an Standing Rock such as I saw in East Germany chuckle so hockey in Romania or we're finished and we don't have much time left\nAre you familiar with the recent example of arming yeah\nCorrect yeah oligarchy ... in ... gene or that was literally a overthrown by hundreds of thousands of people in the streets shutting\nDown because what happened in East Germany I mean I was in Alexander plots was half a million East Germans and the ... state was the most efficient security and surveillance state in human history into our own\nThis is the twenty fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords which which side denounces Palestinian versus ...\nAh since then the possibilities of an independent viable Palestinian state has receded under both Republican and democratic administrations what'd you see in terms of the future for the Palestinians and for the region as a whole\nWell I mean that's why I support the boycott divest sanction movement because it's the only weapon we have left Israel's worried about it um that movement has gained a fair bit of traction in Europe um they are seeking the Israeli lobby decriminalize it here in the United states\nOr I mean we talk about Russian interference in the elections how about Israeli interference in the elections I mean they literally a pack gives money to candidates and\nUh obviously the assault is worse and worse especially cutting off funding us funding to unravel the un relief agency\nRyan refugees provides food I mean most people in Gaza depend at this point they live in the largest open air prison in the world\nUm don't have access I mean Israel has bombed the sewage treatment plants so the whole coast of Gaza is filled with raw sewage they bombed the power plants a of Ninety eight percent of the water is you can drink\nA no it's just a horror show and\nAh the extremism of the Netanyahu government which has openly racist\nA is a few steps away from calling for the extinction if not the force to deportation of the Palestinians I mean they already living ring ghettos even in the west bank if you look at the military roads and the settlements and everything else so [noise]\nYeah the failure on the part of the international community to respond to this horrific a violation of international law and humanitarian crisis is really a terrible terrible stain um but of course the Palestinians are are poor and powerless some um our yeah everyone's quite willing to sell them out\nBut Washington is is the great enabler not just of course financial or satellite a BBS movement so important in the United states\nTalk about um again a\nAttitudes as superior attitude that I see on the left let's say or in liberal circles oh I Can't I Can't support Chris Hedges you know he voted for Nader ah I Can't support this person because she can eat\nI Can't you know support this I Can't get involved with this person because uh they drive an SUV pretty soon there's nobody
