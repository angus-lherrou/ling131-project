San Francisco [noise]\n\nSo what it costs you get these co ops by fairly privileged people who decide to reject this corporate food regime [noise] they want to live differently they want healthy food they went for it which is recognized [noise] and they weren't enough snippets battle [noise]\nAll of these instances of people pushing back in ... called the counter movements [noise] the counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push them\nIf you want to change the streets [noise] we're gonna have to understand on capitalism [noise] it's not just about surviving within\nCapitalism which I think costs are very\nHelpful for as we've seen this storm\nBut can actually change [noise]\nThat Eric Holder the menace and this is the alternative radio I'm David ... army on this edition of a A R features Eric whole team manners on pushing back the corporate food regime\nFood is the basis of life we needed to live it's as simple as that the un declares the right to an adequate food is a long standing international human rights\nBut the aim of twenty first century capitalism is not primarily to promote our wellbeing and health it is to control markets and maximize profits\nThe production of food is a gigantic global enterprise dominated by a handful of mega corporations General Mills Pepsi nationally Unilever and Coca Cola\nWhile they do well hunger and food insecurity affects billions of people around the world including tens of millions in the United states\nCommunities are pushing back the corporate food regime ... co ops environmental and food activists London I should of India says\nFood has been transformed into a commodity destroying farmers livelihoods destroying the health of the planet and the health of people she calls on us to become the change we want to see in the food system so no Russia's the earth and all beings\nOur guest today is Eric Holder the menace he's the executive director of food first the institutional food and development policy\nIs the author of calm Pacino outcome Pacino voices from Latin America is former to farmers movement and foodies guy to capitalism\nHe was the keynote speaker at a meeting of the consumer cooperative management association in Portland, Oregon\nAnd now Eric Holder the madness\n... she moved on boom boom boom like in my ... my ... my ...\nMy grandfather is turning over in his basket grave were butchered that sentence but I just think that it's an honor to\nBe here with you\nOn indigenous lands and I thought I should honor indigenous people with my own indigenous language\nThank you um\nTalk start talking about or capitalism by talking about the colonial food regime and I think good place to start talking about the colonial food regime is with the Irish family\nAnd really encapsulates or what the food system has\nBeen about ever since the dawn of capitalism let me just read from here from my book\nIt doesn't matter if the food is fresh organic uh rubella or a Big Mac\nTest from highland from Ethiopia or cheese whiz from Walmart doesn't matter whether you need it or not whether it's good or bad for your where it's locally produced or travels from afar whether it was corral cage free range or let a happy life\nIf enough people wanted and have the money to buy it someone will turn it into a commodity\nAnd sell it so that is the basis of our food system as a commodity system\nWhen the commodity system was introduced to the world during the and that's just a revolution\nAnd not only changed the forces of production it changed the relations of production and millions and millions of people were uprooted from their lives from their villages 'em and driven\nA out of their social relations and out of their productive relations into a capitalist\nRelations into the factories the satanic meals um and many starved or even though there was plenty of food the Irish potato famine it's really a misnomer there was plenty of food in Ireland or during the famine people were just too poor to buy it\nIn fact it was one of the golden age of a\nEnglish or agriculture high farming and\nUm but people had been separated from their means of production and we're no longer able to feed themselves and were flocking into this attack meals or to look for work where they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism\nThat's introduction of what we called the colonial food regime [noise]\nNow this was a great concern to great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention to have something to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in a co-op cooperative there's some um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert on\nA who was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities um but\nAnd he was also trying to uh not just sort of reform\nThe cap can the capitalist system that was being imposed on Western Europe at the time particularly British Isles\nBut he wanted something different he really wanted something radical he wanted to pull out of the capital system and you also want to collapse to help do this so we begin to see the cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or Robert own said we don't really studied much\nOh and and crew the philosopher is and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas and what we called the public sphere where there was all this debate in the coffee houses in London about oh\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally being worked to death\nAnd of course those were the partisans who had been de skilled and displaced by the industrial revolution\nAnd whose work had been devalued because of this enormous what they call reserve ... an army of labor starving people willing to work for nothing in order to survive and so you see this response\nFrom the co opt for survival resistance survival but more than that because when people get together and once they can eat\nThey begin to talk\nAnd they've got to talk about a lot of things they began to talk about suffrage they begin to talk about evolution of slavery they began to talk about changing governments they begin to talk about democracy they get to talk about how to change the world so they can see cops being a as a place of\nThe public sphere where a different vision of society is cultivated I shouldn't happen just in the British Isles of course it happened to all around the world there are many histories of co ops engaging in social change\nAnd the ... you know everyone knows if I'm On that are going I should be proud of them on that are going to given my heritage back ones are gone and has a food co-op which absolutely for reasons\nThe farmers and I'm so I'm not too happy about that but when they were going I think was his trotted out a time and time again because it's one of the most successful capitalist collapse\nUm it really is a big corporate capitalism co-op and it's been surprisingly successful so they begin to see a range of responses to capitalism which is one accommodation reform progressive change and isn't very radical change\nA lot of my example is coming from Liberia and peninsula the uh anarchists\nSo the world bank steps in and said you got to keep up your payments [noise] um well alone you the money shaking up your payment is just public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution that's our money\nSo public money was used to learn to farm to governments in the global south to keep up their payments private banks in the north but you've got to sign\nOn the dotted line with this guy over here it was always a guy\nAnd he was from the IMF the IMF said there was a little thing would cost structural adjustment we'll give you the money but you have to promise to remove all your tariff barriers dismantled all your marketing boards\nUm get rid of of all your or um food crops don't worry about food will grow it in the north dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um started growing things more coffee and flowers these things were to get your dollars so you can pay back the banks\nIs this called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries put them up on the market will come down will buy them thank you very much so what's happening to us today in the United states happened first\nIn the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened in the third world privatization upcoming privatization of uh the post office already happened for a third world I'm so privatization\nIs basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd a complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade deregulation that's what the world Trade Organization about and we have this this rush of free trade ... the\nFree trade mania World Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production in the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within the year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we have so many immigrants here today\nIs because these arrangements these agreements these capitalist\nAgreements destroyed their livelihoods that's why you're here and you look at who's who's uh in the back of the house with the fancy restaurants former farmers whose cutting the launch those are farmers\nWho is doing all the farm work\nAll the stupid labor those were farmers so when farmers in this country say oh gee is who's going to you know all the farmers are disappearing\nNo there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by farmers just happen to be brown so what it costs doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished\nBut then they begin to get what I learned was another um\nSecond when called the second wave of cause and you get these co ops by fairly privileged people\nThey want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organize and they push back\nAll of these instances of people pushing back is with carpal on your call the counter movement\nThe counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity out of belief\nFor out of survival ... anyway we get the second wave and I like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement\nMhm but the woman has many roots\nAnd one of the roots as the food justice movements in the food justice movement comes out of the tradition as African Americans goes out of the needs of Mexican Americans\nComes out of the desires of Asian Americans people with a very different position and the food system but who find different ways\nOf ensuring their own food security out of necessity and so today we have a really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters all these people talk about the food movement Raj Patel I'll pay me um and\nI think we have to sort of cop to the fact that\nThe food and one of the reasons the food movement is here not just because we're rejecting\nA processed food which we should just pretty bad for us as everybody knows where we're also trying to deal with the contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China\nI'm In this country when people winter seven people are going hungry\nWe don't call it hunger because food insecurity\nThere's a special way of measuring it might not um if you call it hunger you won't get a USDA grounds I sure do you have to call it food insecurity\n\nBut one in seven people in this country so that tells you right away that hunger is not the result of scarcity\nWhy are people going hungry and the richest country in the world with more food than anybody else because they can't afford it and so hungry maps very closely with poverty\nHunger also maps and very closely in this country with rich so the highest levels of food insecurity in this country are among people of color we have a racialized food system\nAnd this is one reason we have a strong food justice movement to deal precisely what kinds of inequity\nNow it turns out that the figure\nI just gave you one in seven hungry people in the United states\nReflects perfectly\nHow many hungry people that are in the world about one in seven people are going hungry in the world in fact depending how you measure it it might be much greater but by the standard um a means of measurements from the uh United Nations uh one is having people are going hungry now you're a lot about from bill\nGates and others that we have to go to Africa and we'd have to save Africa from Hungary we need to take the new green revolution to Africa and Africa Africa Africa where are you guys so interested in Africa\nAll of a sudden oh well African never got a chance for the green revolution it's not true actually agreements wishing failed in Africa but in fact that if you really want to end hunger that's not where most of the hungry people are most of the hungry people are in Asia and Pacific why aren't we talking about that\nAnd the Pacific that's why so they bring the pollution isn't just about expensive inputs\nAbout fertilizers and hybrid seeds and pesticides and all that the green revolution is about\nExchanging one food system for another exchanging president food systems for capitalist food systems and so logically and historically as it always has it displaces and dispossessed says millions of people and drives them into the ranks of the hungry his wife producing more food the way we produce food\nIn the industrial food system is never going to solve hunger back in two thousand uh\nH. and again in two thousand eleven we've had record harvest record profits and we also had record hunger around the world\nUm we'd never produced so much food as we did during those food crises and there were food riots around the world during this time you might remember there are food rice in this country\nIt was put right in Milwaukee when they were still writes in places where you would expect them like in sub Saharan Africa or I'm In Haiti where people were eating mud biscuits to survive\nBetter in Milwaukee\nWasn't 'cause there wasn't enough food is because people couldn't afford it but meanwhile ATM Monsanto Cargill general foods Safeway or Walmart or making\nRecord profits at the height of the food crisis\nAnd again this is science because of a lack of food we've been over producing food for half a century we produce ... percent more food every year for everybody per capita I mean every one of us should get ... percent more food every year\nOf course not everybody does so what that tells you is you can produce more and more food it doesn't matter if people are poor and they can't buy it and we will have hunger the price of food it's been going down\nIn going down ever since Nineteen hundred until two thousand and eight and we got this tremendous bike and the price of food and then a billion people start going hungry in the world how do you explain this\nYou're listening to Eric whole team a niche on pushing back the corporate food regime\nThis is an independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and his book a food ... guide to capitalism\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven again that number is one eight hundred\n... percent is all the globe the in 'em all the corporate food regime controls\nGlobally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's food systems\n\nNow co ops don't control much of the food in this country I Know and farmers are too weak to demand anything\nBut people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer in this country Walmart biggest employer in this country\nWhat if we were to converge in all of our diversity how powerful might we'd be and then by saying that the counter movement as far as we're concerned is the food movement it has a progressive\nWing and it has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings one neo liberal and one reformist\n... and if the counter movement expects to introduce any reforms much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive than the radicals are going to have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described\nThere are all represented here but which ones should come together my position is that the progressives in the radicals need to come together because if the reformist in the progressive to come together than the Contra movement is split down its back and becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes\nThe reformers weren't being assigned to change the two week why because the new liberals or hedge I'm On it this is the age of neo liberalism what's keeping us from coming together I Would say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with\nOne would be sexism and now there would be racism and another would be classes and\nWe have to deal with these things brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have to be fearless we have to call it out I have to call out my privilege as a white male and I have to allow people to call it up right here right now\nEverywhere\nWe've got to dismantle patriarchy we've got to dismantle racism this is an extra work this is the work because it [noise]\n\nBecause if we don't dismantle what is keeping us apart we will never come together\nThank you very much [noise] [noise]\nOh it's just a curious you said there are three million grocery workers do you know uh this this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in that as part of the food oh\nYes I Do but I Can't remember it [laughter]\nYes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organized restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers have some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest of within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question of all the inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but what people in this room all respect what I'm saying about this one so we had eleven thousand members are small co-op and upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raised their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plans their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you discuss\nRight we realize is in our school board work in my community that's what people were coming to us demanding security in the front of the school buildings\nHad not checked her all the ... to see whether or not they were supporting Remington\nRight so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we just stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question is it [noise] I think I I really do believe that that\nReflection of action\nNeeds to take place within the public sphere is which we consciously create I think that we need a radical public spheres I Need we need public sphere is deeply rooted in community um and these\nIssues have to be put on the table and you know people are going to get defensive\nUm but we can't not address those inconsistencies a and I think that the only\nThere's no easy way but I think that as we understand the structures which is driven is to this dead end\nEnd to the contradictions in our society into the violence that we experience in our society is understand the structures behind that and called him out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues\nAs well and I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nSo we can't just in addressed that intellectually we can't just addressed that organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege\nWe can't get anywhere if we're if we have these hangers on us which means we do have to do the internal work the good news is you don't have to do it alone in fact you can't do it alone and the good news is that there are tools for this\nIf you look at ... Native American communities today they have developed all kinds of ways of dealing with the trauma of genocide and constant constant work on genocide\nThere are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with racism and how to dismantle racism from both sides of the ...\nSexism and patriarchy so I think that to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nThere's no guarantees on this you know we don't know what's going to happen\nWe don't know if we can avoid planetary collapse civilization will collapse the planet will go on\nWe won't we don't know but what if we didn't even try what else are you going to do is trying to change everything were you busy sounds intimidating but what else I've been\nDoing this stuff for a long time and very much for a position of privilege to meant Trent tremendous mobility got educator I never thought I Would I mean I grew up as a farm worker but I'm the only one in my family because of the way I look I'm that got a PHD I get depressed\nI get really depressed looking at these numbers and the only way I've been able to keep my spirits up is to align myself\nWith those who don't have that luxury those people for whom getting a pope is not an option we need to build these alliances and commit to them in fact they will save us all\nWhat do you think the potential power as of your story or some version of it for opening a constructive dialogue with a working class faction of the Trump coalition and um\n[noise] do you think that it's worth energy or to invest in that direction and do you have any specific suggestions about that\nYeah I think we need to remember is that there's a big faction of people who voted for Trump that voted for Obama\nI Would reach out their first established established dialogue and it really doesn't have to be a dialogue Nancy Frazier has a term called progressive Neal liberalism to describe a nearby ministry\nThat the administration was very progressive on identity politics for example but essentially new liberal as far as the economy was concerns\nAnd that would I think very accurately described the Democratic party right now and that's why they couldn't let Bernie Sanders in [laughter] because he was a progressive but he wasn't neo liberal ... so\nWe share the same um damage social and economic damage as men of all the Trump supporters right you can't just blame things on Trump Trump is not an ... an anomaly in my mind Trump is like the logging logical conclusion where we've been heading for a long time\nUm and unfortunately you know is is the er the rise or is that a a precursor hopefully not the end of of ah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22"}
