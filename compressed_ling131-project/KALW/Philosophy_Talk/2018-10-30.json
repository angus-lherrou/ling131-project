questions everything except their intelligence time John fair and I'm Ken Taylor program comes to you from the studios of KLW San Francisco we continue conversations that began at philosopher corner on the Stanford campus\nThat for a country to Boston and I did for forty here\nToday it's a special edition of philosophy we are we looking beyond the horse race asking some of the philosophical questions raised by this year's presidential election\nTrump and Clinton dominate the headlines in part because the Republican and Democratic Party's dominate our government which leaves a lot of people wishing they had more viable third party options so why do we have the two party system where you know we'll talk with rolling Kmart from the Brookings Institution\nIn a democracy you end up with something that a lot of people don't like because you have to make a compromise\nDid your party nominees also stems from the influence of money on every aspect of the campaign and politics in general\nWill examine the role of money in politics with former secretary of labor Robert\nRegime if we're free and equal citizens we actually should have an equal opportunity to influence political debate\nNo water if you're so dissatisfied with the candidate that you wonder if you should vote at all\nWill you be in good company the U.S has some of the lowest voter participation in the world\nWill be joined in just a bit but Stanford political scientist Emily Chapman will ask or whether voting is a choice or duty\nFirst we center roving philosophical reporter super calling card\nTo put that question to potential voters she filed this report\nScrewed up\nThe\nRed Bull [noise]\nKing junior delivered that speech in South Carolina in Nineteen sixty six [noise]\nBut\nWe're going to vote for him and\nHe told an African American audience to head to the pool and create positive change for their community and their country\nHere for about a lot of them are about\nTo begin with why do you vote why should you\nNot everyone thinks voting is the way to go I Do know is so harshly they're living in California I figured\nThat President or this famous decided it's not like we're in a state\nI don't feel as voting is not going to have an impact\nOn people's hair fires I feel like if it would be more for my own sort of felt validation feeling like I was a way it probably will not get as\nMany argue there's no point in voting because we have a two party system that limits chances if any true democracy in\nOur founding father George Washington thought all political parties are not\nIn his farewell address Seventeen Ninety six he wrote\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another sharp and by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension or is it you know a frightful despotism\nAnd then there's money there's a lot of it and politics according to open secrets three months before the twenty sixteen presidential elections Hillary Clinton had received over four hundred and thirty million dollars in campaign contributions over half of them from corporations\nSo uh the first thing I Would do would be to make a election day a national holiday uh I think that not only lowered some of the barriers for participation but it also gives people a more positive reason to vote because it's sort of\nSuggests a this sort of public element of celebration around elections or rather than just thinking of it as something\nReally a private that you do a ... just like filling out any other kind of farm\nOkay that's the first thing you do you is there more we're going to be three things\nYeah so a voter registration making voter registration automatic and having a a consistent and and uh up to date and efficient method for\nA seeing who was on the voter rolls I think would be very important and that would be absolutely necessary for following through with the third thing I Would do which would be to make a voting compulsory with the system similar to Australia's\nTwenty dollar fine yeah OK well us through dollars are married [laughter] American dollars\nSo it takes a lot of really this is better I'm going to vote but I always vote and I hope some of our listeners out there\nWho might be sitting on the fence will be convinced to vote for somebody or something thanks very much I Hope so too [noise]\nEmily ... from Stanford University at her

system\nYou got something to say hey I\nBut you will not find that I ever changed a meal for a while\nAny donation I ever received [noise]\nThrowing money at all because they have total control\nSingle thing she does\nWe're joined now by Robert rice he was the labor secretary under President Bill Clinton now he is professor of public policy at the University of California Berkeley He's the author of saving capitalism for the many knocked a few\nBut welcome to philosophy died\nA thank you very much Ken and John\nI Know you feel strongly about this topic that we want to talk to you about the influence of money in politics and I'm particularly concerned with the question of whether all this money in politics is really consistent with a thriving democracy I what I fear that it is not I I Wonder what you think\nIt definitely is not a and this is not a new issue uh years ago a really at the tail end of the first gilded age\nWhen economic power was concentrated in wealth is concentrated in a very few hands uh the eminent jurists Louis Brandeis a shed and I can only paraphrase him a we have a choice we can either have great wealth in the hands of the very few people or we can have a democracy we cannot have both\nSo let's distinguish a economic equality and inequality from political equality and inequality I mean\nI I Would think that democracy as part of its foundational thing\nIs committed to equal access to the means of political participation independently of well that's a principle of democracy equality of income that's a good thing but I don't know if that's a fun foundational some degree of equality of income equality of opportunity is foundational democracy but\nCan't you kind of at least conceptually\nCan't you have a equal access to the means of political participation to regulations or various kind without necessarily solving the distribution no problem about how she'll be distributed wells\nWell theoretically you can the Supreme Court though in a series of decisions\nHas decided that number one money is the equivalent of speech\nNow that was in a case called Buckley against ... once you decide that money is the equivalent of speech and you have a free speech First Amendment part of the constitution then that almost by definition gives people with a lot of money\nAnd again we're not talking about just garden variety of inequality here we're talking about why the inequality we're talking or you give people with a lot of money a specialist\nParticipation and then secondly the Supreme Court in Citizens United against the ... of the federal election commission decides that corporations are people under the first amendment\nSo put those two concepts together money is speech corporations are people out of the first amendment and it's no longer equal access to the media would have been participation ...\nLet me uh John roles are whom I admire her this what he called the difference a principled to account for the inequality said it's OK for people to have more than others as long as they're having more contributes to the overall\nUh goodness of life for everyone something like that to the least well ah you know to the least well off so I I Would I Would modify roles in terms of realism and say okay we're going to have twice as much as they need to contribute to the last well off has America ever come close to the different principle um\nWell it's interesting a rolls also get along with that difference principle positive veil of ignorance so that's in coming up with what we might think of as the best set of rules and the most\nA perfect system with regard to distribution of income or we would just say well we don't know where it will come out uh we we have a veil of ignorance over\nHow we would do under those rules but they appear to be fair to us not withstanding that's fairness or is a kind of a matter of what would be good for the system as a whole\nShow that in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as we move toward a more much more egalitarian society than we had before\nI think we came close to the rosy indifference principal or the veil of ignorance principle\nHot starting in the late Nineteen seventies early Nineteen eighties I think we diverge from that most people\nWhen asked for example in a variety of polls not just a single but actually this has been repeated over and over again what do you think the current distribution of wealth is in the United states and what should it be\nA they come up with a you know a fairly consistent ideas but then when they're shown what it actually is almost everybody is surprised because what it actually is is so much more concentrated than what they believe it is or what they think it should be\nI Gotcha and that's kind of depressing but since I'm a philosopher and I'm a little pernicious I mean the money is speech idea\nI get why some people especially when it's a political British I get why some people are question that but it seems kind of reasonable thought there look if I Want to advocate for something\nMe Ken Taylor I Want to advocate for something I don't want an advocate for it on the ... on the public airwaves and all that sort of stuff and I by the time to advocate for it and the government were to come along and say no you can't do that can you can spend your money to advocate for I don't know uh\nThe end of the prison industrial complex I'd say government where do you get off\nRestrict telling me how much I can spend of my own hard earned money or to advocate for things that I Believe in isn't as a democracy so I mean is it an odd thought that money is speech\nKnow it's not an odd thought at all and you put your finger exactly on the Supreme Court's logic or the problem is that when you have as much concentration of income and wealth as we now have\nAnd the same for the Supreme Court [noise]\nWell I think there are a few justices or why is there are few centers are wise but mostly I Would say or attempt to get some philosopher kings and there hasn't been too will either\nYou're listening to philosophy dog gets are two thousand and sixteen election special\nCare here's a rental for you what are these three people have in common Jill Stein Gary Johnson and Darryl castle\nJohnson and started running for president I don't know the other one\nHe's running for president to\nThese are just three of the so called third party candidates\nAbout why our third parties represented elsewhere in our government what explains the overwhelming dominance of the two major parties in American politics\nQuestioning our two party system when philosophy topic continues\nHey what about that potted plant sitting in the corner is it possible you're not fully appreciate in your Philip

I'm going to tell you why plants are eleven on the one to ten scale of awesome the awesome communication abilities of plants and other non human species on the next big picture science handing\nYour way and the one o'clock hour here on local public radio K. A. on that me where philosophy talk continues\n[noise]\nWelcome back it's our twenty sixteen election special I'm John Kerry visited as far as we talk on the program that questions everything\nYour intelligence on ... we're looking through a philosophical\nWhich will camping right now a closer look at our two party system [noise]\nThe Republican I Want to run as the Republican nomination [noise]\nIs there\nAnyone on stage is all willing tonight to pledge or support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and not Ron an independent campaign\nParty presumptive nominee jumped onto the Democratic party elites have been caught red handed sabotaging a grassroots campaign that tried to bring your numbers of young people independents a non voters into their party instead they've shown exactly why American anything new major party\nYou\nStand and speak and vote your conscience for candidates up and down the ticket\nPrice [noise]\nWe're joined now by laying Kmart she's a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution she's author of primary politics everything you need to know about how America nominates presidential candidate Elaine welcome to below three dogs\nWell thank you for having me\nAway and you've written in part a lot about the two party system let's let's start with a final verdict good thing or bad thing\nUm I don't think it's good or bad because the way I party system evolves is a reflection of the underlying way a country chooses to organize this democracy I think it's neutral just as I think a multi party system is also neutral they each have their upsides in their downsides\nAnd the fact is they come out of the structure of the Democratic system that a country or state chooses to use for itself\nSo but wait a minute let's go down a little bit of it comes out of the structure of it was just another country uses words to use ... or ... which is are designed for democracy right it was mentioned parties anywhere to men than anybody not did our founding fathers are part of it would be the death of democracy and all that so we're not talking about the plight\nWell what I'm Talking about is our constitution established a house of representatives and we establish single member districts and any country as other countries have that have single member districts it means that you will lead to one person from the district\nIf you'll elect one person from the district it is very hard to divide that person individual into four or five different parties down\nThe vote that would be cruel and unusual punishment yes the motor certainly would and not to mention very confusing so let's let's jump ahead\nToday there are a lot of people not just a few a lot of people who\nExpress a deep dissatisfaction with the two party system they expressed deep resentment that they've got this limited choice\nAnd that they want a third part of the they're hungry for a third party it sounds to me like you're saying your message to those people and not to put too fine a point of it and it is get over it I mean is that right\nWell let me put it this way there is nothing that keep any American from forming a political party there are there has\nBeen third parties in American history but again going back to the structure of the system if you have a winner take all districts it means that it is very hard for a third party to get traction because getting twenty or twenty five percent of the vote just doesn't do anything for you\nParty system or a multi a candidate district you get twenty five percent of the vote and you wind twenty five percent of the seats in the parliament\nI'm In those countries a small party can grow it can get some power in one election do a good job in office maybe become part of the majority governing coalition and grow into the next election right\nIn our system in or in any one one pass the post system it's really hard for a third party to get traction\nThat's why mostly what happens to third parties and American democracy is that they get they have gotten incorporated into one of the two major parties\nSo so when I was a growing up uh France was really in disarray they couldn't get anything done and we were told that it's because they had so many different political parties nobody really heavily per than the goal took over and they did\nDid better but now in America we seem to have just two parties but also nothing gets done Congress can't do anything or do we managed to have the best the worst of both worlds\n[laughter] we're in a period of our history where not just the parties by the voters are highly polarized and the parties are simply reflecting the what the voters are telling them we we are in a very highly polarized time and at some point this will break\nBut remember we've been through highly polarized times in our republic before maybe the most dramatic being of course the party system prior to the civil war where they never could resolve things and they actually went to war over it\nUm we were also highly polarized at the end of the nineteenth century so we've been through a lot of periods of polarization in American politics and they usually end by one party\nActually capturing a working majority and that strong enough to a get some things done and be caused an end to the polarization\nBut no one of the consequences of what do you enjoy talking about oh no let's think about the nature of these two parties in a in a in a first I suppose the\nSingle representative system versus a multi party system was proportional representation those parties are going to be it seems to me 'cause it's a big complicated country yep those parties are going to seem to me highly kind of coalition Owen somewhat ideologically the fuse right\nNow yeah that's absolutely I mean they have to be they are they are the proverbial big tent\nUm for many years southern Democrats were very different from northern Democrats and New England Republicans were liberal and very different from western Republicans um yeah if they've always been big chance but they are also always evolving in other words there's nothing static\nAbout American political parties they've always changed um and you know the party of Lincoln or the Eighteenth sixty Republican Party that was that declare the Emancipation Proclamation\nA lot of people at the Republican convention were wondering what happened to the party of Lincoln okay so there are always changing\nBut let's see I don't want to go back to the current dissatisfaction with the two parties I mean the Tea Party found the Republican Party is then constituted highly unsatisfactory the Sanders people from the Democratic party highly unsatisfied many people call themselves independent though they still vote for one party or the other more or less\nConsidered family I mean it sounds like a ... so you got these two parties are highly ... coalition oh but there's bound to be dissatisfaction with them because of that but it also sounds like your message to the folks who are highly dissatisfied", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "year": "2018",
