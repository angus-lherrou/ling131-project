I guess is Steven Pinker and we're asking whether reason and save us\nCan reason only tell us how to achieve our ultimate aims are kind of also tell us what ultimate aims are worth adopting join the conversation I raising your hand and the ... come around to\nSee so look philosophers have talked about the nature of reason for a long long time way Aristotle Plato or none of that's been was scientific and was like upper reorient intuitive I Want you to put your cognitive scientist Diana I'm from the perspective of cognitive science how should we think of\nOf reason in this in the twenty first century is it like single capacity was Descartes right with Plato right is it a bundle of distinct capacities tell us the most astounding thing that's probably the science is\nThe ... discovered about reason\nThere's systematic are discrepancies between reasoning that is how the human mind perceives left to its own devices and reason in a sense of our best understanding of what follows from what\nFor a long list of discrepancies between how we think and how we often like\nTo live like this normative uh ... how we ought to think what counts as good as friends lost his rebel and that stuff so that norms of rationality right and you're saying the striking thing to come and scientists discovered is that we don't live up to those norms a brain is not designed to live up to them so\nI'm ... now of course it can't be the case that were incapable of rationality otherwise we've never be able to make the argument that people are systematically irrational because we wouldn't have a benchmark of rationality against which to compare the human\nWho make that argument people like you know what that really [laughter] I mean you're the world right now the scientist you bought that argument what about the ordinary or\nWere you you the argument would be incoherent unless we had a standard of what rationality was you couldn't say people are irrational because there'd be no such thing as rationality and we wouldn't be able to have a conversation in the\nFirst place or a conversation about anything else for that matter you wouldn't be able to have this program if there wasn't a standard of rationality that you are exercising\nAnd things like ... I mean I agree and it seems like the question then is okay how do we get from one ... how do we get from our flawed everyday reasoning process is to this more normative standard reason\nYeah and that's where the norms and institutions of Greece and I come in principles like a free speech like open debate like the uh avoiding the fallacies like arguing ad hominem or Adrienne from the historical origin of an argument\nThat demand that is a claim isn't periodically be confronted against evidence or from the world all the things that aren't terribly natural to us but once we implemented them\nWe've seen that collectively they make a smarter than any one of us as individuals\nThat is what I was gonna say collectively cause some stuff you were talking about requires kind of collective structures but my vision\nRight is it gets ... in my brain I open my eyes I focus I see the clock I Need your help to see the clock but I'm a new job to see that it's a clock 'cause I Need the concept that I get that\nBut my hearing doesn't require your aid I mean sort of reason is some like capacity in my brain why do I need the help of all you guys do a sand trap\nWell in fact one of the fundamental on discovery for philosophy is that I that naive realism just opening your eyes and seeing the world as it is is false that there are you about their sexual illusions and just as there are cases what our eyes to see that there are cases where our minds to see us\nYou've got to show where your eyes to see you pull out a yardstick you um use better methods of a ... and the same thing for logical\nWell but there's something there was a capacity in my brain for vision this past Sunday in my brain for audition for sensing things up right from sensory motor recording\nThat there are illusions and like that but is there a capacity in my brain cause all that stuff you talk about about corruption and the norms that doesn't seem like it's just in my brain it somehow in on the chili electrical votes\nCan I mean so I mean I think the norms institutions was a really important in deep one right the collectively we can achieve much more uh in in the demand reason that we can and eventually\nBut you know you're encountering in one way to reach comments to say oh my God\nWe're all system on were all just blindly distinguished but you do you make a dance and wonder is this is right on so that has a has a thinking it's just a woman just sort of our our automatic kind of risk stick a very flawed way as a person the data from the world\nBut we also have system too which is our reasoning where we can we can actually reflect on and say oh\nWell boy or the straw my drink looks back\nBut I guess maybe it isn't actually yeah it's like an apartment there were you know I I tend to agree with Steve ... even as an individual level or not doomed because we've got our system to even as\nI mean I I mean do you like those are things because there are people who don't like the system one system to distinction but are you one who likes it or just like\nYeah I I I think it captures something about cognition and I would just add that the system to works not just because we can put on thinking caps and sit back and reflect and and Bob punter slowly\nBut also we have social institutions such as the fact that if we make a claim someone else can disagree with us and we have to defend that or if it's an empirical claim were called on to do I get evidence to do experiments to consult data so that was for social institutions\nThat our system to a recruits in the first place and insists on applying that makes for them to affect us\nSo if I were to try to ask well what actually is this capacity for a reason\nIt's partly in our psychology\nBut it's partly somehow distributed in our collective lives together because you're like you are like an instrument for your like part of my talking to the system 'cause I could it's like mill says you know anybody who just at those his own side of the\nWere coming to you from Kepler is books in Menlo Park California will take more questions from our live in lively and rational and they have an audio and enlightenment to win philosophy thought continues [noise]\n\n\n\nMm\n[noise]\n\n\nThe jury not\nMeaning\nHe ran saying gee\nLot of one\nMean uh\n[noise]\nYou know\nThink ...\n...\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThanks again Dr live musical gas Tiffany often an Adam Sean I'm ... and this is philosophy talk program questions ever\nAccept your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor we're asking whether reason can save us with the speaker of the Harvard University\nYou might want to go back to that question okay even perfectly rational individual noises rationally going about it it doesn't necessarily add up to a rational collective decision I think this is one of the problems of the twenty first century so what do you think\nKnow we we obviously can't optimize uh everything I everyone's preferences hour or ... years even any criteria by which was preferences can be simultaneously yeah optimize the other hand you can't dispute whether or not rationality and progress knowledge\nIs possible of course it's possible we voted needed smallpox we said something to the moon we invented the Internet and the smartphone and acts like that but I gave something has the\nA problem like global warming which is a collective action problem right which I Can't just come up I suppose I could have the killer technology that's all that but that's you know if the tipping point gets too long ago to make people adopt and use that technology and all this stuff\nLike that we've got these collective action problems and the difference between now and before is that we have impacts on a global scale but we don't really have global institutions or at least not adequate global institution that tornadoes all so I don't know I think we could be headed for like deep disaster even if we're all a individually\nFor like an ad that just to try to make it a little worse [laughter] I mean I I'm a big fan of reason as you are\nBut I have a worry in this particular ... um that you know the worry would be well only the only other case you're talking about there isn't really a tension\nBetween um the kind of progress that comes out of these indictments ... an institution but here it seems as though the progress depend\nUpon technological advancement that is causing climate and so here it seems like we have ... ... is a real problem for the view we can't just say well let's let's sort of sick in Lightman values on the six progress on this program is a very thing that's been causing the problem in the first\nWell I Know because if it's causing the potential for disaster that that's not progress I mean I think we could we would all agree well but the thing about a recent as they can always stop back in ... and ... the problem is that the application of reasons in the past has caused so far\nAnd so we can I indeed frame the technological question as given that we have improved our physical standards of living so far the costs of the environment\nHow do we change that trade offs that we can enjoy the same benefit of energy capture of moving people around heating homeschooling homes making cement without a releasing massive amounts I feel too and I got I think you also mystic about that that ... what was the thing is I'm not making a\n... will succeed I'm challenging the idea that there's some inherent reason that we can\nYeah but I don't think of and then going back to the collection active right Bob uh once again I'm not but they make a prediction that pets that I Know that we're going to solve it maybe ... maybe that will be disaster however I don't think it's a problem it is the principal we cannot solve it because we know that collective action problems\nI have been solved on a global scale true global institutions again there's no I'm not guaranteeing this all day but there is a pathway by which everyone agrees to a sacrifice ...\nLike I like the ... let's get some more or less the rudest there there's not a guarantee that will take it just there's no in principle reason that we can't agree about that one of them have lobbied out there when I Am a good\nIdea I'm from Iran um I think it's a little bit unfair to judge a reason with advances in technology you know technology is something that reason is kind of the foundation but uh you know\nHow does the reason made us happy or like sending man to the moon is it something valuable you know\nThere's two parts of one of them is that there can be things that make us better off that don't necessarily make us happier\nBut in general the answer is we we have gotten happier on average a majority of countries to which we have data over the decades levels of happiness shows that the majority of those countries happiness has increased United States by the way he's not one of them [laughter]\nBut I'm a joy eighty eighty seven percent of countries for which we do have data show that they have gotten happy and says you have a\nI said well I think about this question is um Horatio reason her ready for science rent for progress but you know what about in China right so this is something I think a lot about my work about the you know as the the reach of science expands\nAnd in your book in ... shows up such things like ... which is in ... but I think\nIt's also like Sprite some ... some fairy godmother isn't you know when it's love art and things like that and so I I Want us to kind of rephrase that happiness question this way you know isn't doesn't happiness also depend on ... and where's the where's the it was the French I'm just gonna\nShrinking shrinking shrinking so he's intended by science\nAnd then I thought you know as I Am and chanted by by love and by art\nThat the strikes and ferries you can keep okay travel [laughter] they were metaphorical yeah this is I I I deal with this in in late ... now because I Know there is I Know there's the view that well we've eliminated famine and we've doubled human life spans and leave a reduced child mortality by a factor of a hundred and we've\nEliminated war for most of the plant but yeah I saw\nOne in order to you know [laughter] you know about a hit on a\nTreadmill you know you get more and more stuff and you say it will be settled there is [laughter] I mean that's part of it even though he didn't like what is the point what is the purpose what is my life for what do I give my life over too\nWell you know I really don't think that eliminating the disease and starvation and poverty and war is is all that boring and meeting [laughter] but even if you don't a segment war true and it turns out he said no it's not true that the studies that show that people are not happier after winning the lottery that veterans are to the wrong people really are happier\n[laughter]\nEven if that were true living to uh the age of eight is better than living to ... okay that's a that's a good question I but I I Do agree that we need to have a more heroic narrative of the fact that we are a limited in child mortality and we are reducing war\nHow you can restore the sense of\nPurpose nobility in here with him and excitement to things like world peace and I said cheating the United nations sustainable development goals\nAnd maybe that doesn't get the plug [laughter] not a very quick if properly advanced in frames\nOkay so the ... I Want to do something that we do from time to time here on philosophy talk\nGonna make use our of rationality [laughter] at least ... hours and you get to change what ever institutions whatever laws whatever practices educational whatever you like nobody can resist it so your task is to make reason govern our lives more and", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "21"}
