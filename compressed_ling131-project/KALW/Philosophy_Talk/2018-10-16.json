working teaches philosophy and I did for about forty years\nAnd today we're thinking about the ethics of international debt can or something\nLike two hundred trillion dollars of debt worldwide uh that doesn't include the solar generator I bought from Amazon yesterday but the real problem is that there are twenty four nations in crisis 'cause they can't pay off their debts\nLot of the I mean some of these veterans Asians are once rich nations like grief or Finland but a lot of them are poor developing nations where where the burden of debt is falling mostly on the poor and the disenfranchised all told John it's a massive tragedy\nAnd moan and well about the tragedy but\nAs philosophers what do we have to add we're not bankers or politicians our job is to analyze concepts not loan money\nWell then let's start by doing what we do best let's analyze the concept of death maybe that'll get us somewhere interesting with the\nShelley well it doesn't seem like the most mysterious concept first you've got a debtor who borrows money and uses it\nAnd promises to repay with interest then there's the creditor who lends money loses the use of it but expects to be repaid with interest seems a pretty good starred as far as it goes to thank you\nIn the right circumstances can that can be an extremely good saying it allows people to buy houses students to go to college entrepreneur starting new businesses\nAnd it allows the lender to make a profit while simultaneously serving the broader social good with his money or their money not every\nTime on on everywhere in history has that been thought to be true done I mean the Bible seems to condemn used every and Shakespeare famously declares that one shouldn't either a vow or no or a lender beach I'm a well well did they get it wrong well believe\nShakespeare ended up penniless me but yeah yeah I think they're just wrong in the right circumstances debt is a fair rational ineffective means of making good things happen you\nMake it sounds so simple to unplug but if we take it to the international decades but it doesn't seem to me to work that way up at all I mean your analysis assume that we at the same age in\nWho takes out the loan then later as to either repaired or face the consequences of not repay but so it's that one agents rational calculations but you know someone happens in the case of major national debt when countries take out loans not not at all\nYeah you're you're you're worried about international debt so you know some leader takes out a debt uses it gets very popular than generations later somebody has the ... that's a good point\nYeah I Know it it is one of the problem because the leaders you negotiate at the low a loan and for whatever reason aren't necessarily the same as a lender let's make the decision to pay it back or not pay it back when you know the chickens finally come home to roost maybe decades later it can be a mess\n... leaders come and go a button nations endure conceptually it's the nation if the agent in these cases the agent the bar or the repair is one thing the the the nation\nWell I knew that kind of what you have to say to make your analysis work done but that doesn't change the fact that the people who have to make is a fundamental fact that people have to make these really painful decisions\nTo impose austerity on their ... so they can be pay these debts may not be the same as the people who gleefully took out that that's the first places like if I took out debts\nJohn Boudreau you're listening to love to talk today with

this is philosophy talk the program the questions everything except your until it's\nDebt is our guest is Julie Nelson author of economics for human or do we want to get\nTo like how to think about this that simple model that Jon talked about and whether it's killed up and went through a model but I Want to ask a background question first and then we'll dig into that one back of my background question is\nDoes or does the world need regime of international lending and borrowing I mean the American economy couldn't run without borrowing and lending could the world economy run without there being credit into ...\nI'm probably not there probably isn't a need for some kind of system a what we have now is using the word system is kind of an exaggeration um it's a pretty much chaos out there\nIs chaos out there so we need a better system but if not all that is I'm just trying to get the John said the world war two jet was a good thing I mean\nThere there are there are ... that are responsible and and reasonable the the sort of um [noise] you know good debt which is one small subset is a debt that is a a lending money that goes into productive\nUm [noise] services that then when you look back on natural you know now to increase up paying back a principal in the interest isn't a problem if you use that that loan or to do something like a productive um that's not the case for a lot of the IAEA the international running back in time\nIs it makes sense to ask what what is the typical uh interest rate for a poor country that borrows a lot of money\n[noise] it depends on who they are getting the loans from um right now on global interest rates are quite low so there's actually quite a lot of money floating around looking for some place to live there you know earn any interest at all or so a lot of poor countries had Dan I'm filling up on cheap or lending\nThis is now is because our Federal Reserve has the interest rates so low that just kinda right standard all over the world okay so this is a good time to borrow money or if you're a poor country will fill you still have to pay it back I Want to go back to John's\nRegional thoughts so I ask him we're losing conceptual now who's as what we philosophers do ride in a normal person to person or a person to institution transaction and there's a lender up or you know I borrow money from you you learn money for me were each rational calculators were acting on our own self interest\nRight and economics has a lot to say about transactions between rational calculators acting on each acting on his or her own self interest I mean some people think that the in the tire foundation of economic theory but it just doesn't seem to meet a scale of\nThe nation ... nations right it just doesn't it doesn't does it work at all\nWell in the in the receiving nations here that the person's signing on for the country as a whole is usually some finance minister\nNow the finance minister it might be signing on to ah to get a loan that's going to fund a project owned by his brother in law now that's not not a atypical I'm sort of situation a lot of cases and you know who's going to pay that back um there's been a limits on on uh how much for\nMoney tend to move very really among among a country so that the profits if there are any from that could be in a Swiss bank account by the time that the loan comes to pay back so it's a lot of current pay that back then is\nWhy there's a lot of the moon is one of the issues ... is one of the issues um and even if it's not corrupt it tends to be very uh non transparent on that as a people of the country rarely get any kind of a direct say or even know you know necessarily what their government is is putting them in for\nIs the worst OK so Greece's in this debt crisis is it is it better or worse I mean dictatorships aren't at all responsive or ... or will but\nI Do think they have to be to some extent in the long term responsive to the will of the people there or they have to have ... enforce that says screw you people don't care what you think but democracies you think of as\nThere'll be built in mechanisms that makes the government responds to the will of the people so is it worse for democracies as opposed to totalitarian dictatorial states at all\nI think it can be very problematic for or or even for democracy um there is a category sometimes referred to odious adapt to it you know a dictator borrows money and use it to a lot of their own people you know very hard to see that as in any way you know ethical up that people should have to pay it back\nOn but sometimes I says well democracy though everything should be fine um but democracies have a a leads a they have wide ranges of inequality there if people were more power less power a democracy can easily oppress minority right\nUm it's not like democracy is are you know ... are all fair and equal yeah even in democratic societies who pays and who you know profits from alone can be buried\nSo it's a fraught situation you're listening to philosophy talk we're talking about the ethics of international debt we'd love to have you join this conversation learned does your thoughts and will be forever indebted to you and Lisa from San Francisco's ... drug Lisa what's your comment or question for us\nYes my comment is um well I my mother was trillion and that the whole brain work and the way the media has captured the issue of that are saying that if the irresponsible countries and things like that are completely\nForget that the economic ... there's an economic terrorism also applied by these financial institutions against a emerging democracies the ones that that was the socialist democracies that happened in ... during the day and the government what he had his credit cut off by the world bank\nAnd in fact I'm for example John Perkins who was the chief economist at an international consulting firm where he works He advised the world bank yeah in that U.S Treasury department he wrote a book called confessions of an economic hit man whether he detailed very specifically about how these financial institutions\nAre actually ruined the country's economies the ones that they were seemingly from um you know most in the post colonial or colonial countries and by by ruining their national industry is making it impossible for them to even pay back loans to begin with\nA whole ethics issue has a lot more than just ethic it has to do with world dominance by these major financial institutions that are controlled by the major powers in in the world\nThinks we're the ... that's a lot there to for a two to respond to what what do you think truly I mean what are you living as a lot of thought there was to go wherever you are right\nWell I I had been talking about things from the get the side of the receiving countries but that that very simple story about creditor lender contract ah also doesn't hold up very well from the a side giving the loans I also mentioned already mentioned no expert promotion has nothing to do with the the wellbeing of the country and not\nReally a lot about um expectation of being paid back and you would think when countries loan money or multilateral institutions uh ... yeah lend money they want to get that interests back\nWriters and entertainers as part of San Francisco's lists crawl closing none

G.\n[noise]\n\nThings in our country [noise] you can get them to their backs and fees\n[noise]\n\nWow everyone wants money everyone needs money but when nations have to borrow money often becomes a crippling debt I'm John Perry this is philosophy talked to a program that questions everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm going to and I want money with no interest or justice Julie notes and author of economics for humans and we're thinking about the ethics of international\nDebt okay Julie here comes the opportunity of a lifetime we're going to make use are for a day of the whole world all the economies and everything I ... for however long it takes to get to do with the international debt crisis so what's the first thing you're going to do\nA ... I I get to do several things right now right [laughter] that that the first thing has to do with with the debt cancelation which is the thing that can be done uh immediately but but is really a band aid\nFor the longer rotten situation as long as there's an irresponsible lending going on\nAnd irresponsible borrowing or or borrowing and being done under pressure\nOn the problem is going to continue shouldn't the other two things that need to happen is um [noise] one for a poor country to shift in a way that that aid as a given out right now a lot of you know seemingly humanity\nI don't have to be paid back with interest and not only that they have to be paid back using in dollars yeah or euros or whatever that the lending currency was and you're not going to get that kind of pay back all over you know from from a very basic\nYou know health and education kind of expensive so that kind of really needs to be be moved to ... you know and then the third thing that that you referred to a few times that's that's that's you know better structure for the international financial system so we we don't have this wild west out there that there are orderly ways\nTo settle you know a century international bankruptcy we thought you know total lack of disorder and the grease case\nI think if you ask most Americans are making this poll up but I think it's true I think if you were to ask this is how philosophers do things a counterfactual polls I think if you were to ask most American whether foreign aid is like charity just a gift or a loan\nI Wish they address I bet you most Americans think that foreign aid is again that's why they're so that's why they're so opposed to why are we giving so and so until until all this foreign aid when we got all this problem but that's most foreign aid is mostly in the ... is that not through foreign aid is mostly\nWhat I have lots of checks in front of me but there there's a substantial chunks are in front of loans or um yeah when it is a grant the grant may be very much tied to um you know and maybe in the form of weapons or [laughter] or a ...\nAs the United nations or any of its agencies ever taken a stand against is completely what seems to me completing the various idea of\nOf ah loaning money on the condition or to you buy weapons or on that\nSpecific issue I'm not sure let me I Wonder if there had been some efforts at from the UN agencies to to try to get to some better you know financial structures on some ways of ah yeah structuring a renegotiation of a sovereign debt\nI Want and the owners are about the whole issue of back of the what you said about into a ... year responsible borrowing on Monday Night 'cause I ... that irresponsibility responsibilities kind of in the eye of the beholder suppose I'm a policymaker\nA decision maker at a high level and the government I I'm not like a banker who views I'm not necessarily like a banker\nWho are ... who views the return on investment necessarily in monetary terms but I may I may realize you know there are some ...\nTwenty years down the road there's gonna be a problem with getting this money back but\nThat is for ... lending is for me an instrument or a broader public policy I may get this guy on my side and the battle against the comedies or whatever and yeah you know I don't know if you've got to do with it and then I ever going to get it back going I may not get it back but it's worth it to me\nTo get to to to get him to do much political ... I mean how much of an international lending is driven by broader policy games that are not necessarily tied to just\nThe economics of of of whether you're gonna get the money back\nI Would argue that very large part of it I mean a very large chunks of loans have no real reasonable expectation that they could be paid back again they're going into things that are not going to have you know pay back in hard currency\nThey're going to export credits which is more about selling things from that that giving country then you know than helping or creating a production capacity and they're receiving one or they were about um you know gaining control and being able to put in a various kinds of you know a neo liberal policies like the I Am\nIf it were if the lender lending nations are thinking of that as that way as an instrument of policy rather than just a financial transaction let's let's\nIt's not just instrumental pop policy it's an instrument of power that says if I can do this I can get the power over this country or to make them do things my way so I don't know maybe I'm ... and that would be a good yeah you know it's a corrupt country and I'm trying to clean things up or maybe I just want to open that country's markets you know to a bunch of them I don't want to private companies owned by my cronies\nWho what I'm Wondering is suppose I'm now suppose I'm a citizen and I'm thinking about my country in the world as a as a lender right and I'm thinking about my should I object\nBecause should I object to my country wanting to exercise its power through this\n... this kind of subversive corrosive instrument or should I say on moral grounds because I stand with the party of humanity don't do that country I mean I'm not opposed to an international market but it's a free and fair market but manipulate I'm just trying to figure out how I as a citizen should think about my country that does this stuff\nI Want you to help tell our leaders to not do that stuff [laughter] right I mean I think there is a real\nMoral and ethical issue here um when we're talking about doing the kinds of a financial arrangements here that end up um really bullying and impoverishing or other a weaker countries\nSo Julian ... another debt crisis it's getting a lot of news lately and I would my ten grandchildren and I think about it alive [laughter]\nIs this student debt crisis on the Bernie is going to take care of him and Hillary is not going to quite take care of so completely as burning and the Republicans are I guess going to pretty much ignore or does it have some\nSimilarities with the international debt crisis\nI think it does like again that model of you know a creditor debtor contract and the ethical thing to do is pay back the debt because it was entered into rationally it was good information all of that again breaks down um\n[noise] the levels of debt that students are getting into now are are quite incredible um the idea that uh you know an Eighteen year old is going to be able to mortgage away their life you know we know the brain is not\nQuite you know fully formed at that age and you were telling people to you know that they have the right yeah that that they should do this\nAnd working at a university I Know that a lot of the um [noise] uh that kind of going thing now oh yeah we can uh raised tuition and fees will just raise the financial aid packages buy what does that mean alone aspect to it becomes a way of expanding a universities expanding um you know administrators salaries\nAre all of these kinds of things on on the backs of students\n[noise] yeah so you know but I I'm of many minds about this stuff and I I mean I don't I still hear them any handed it kind of get a ... I still don't think it is intrinsic\nLending and borrowing is intrinsically bad I'm not Shakespeare got it wrong the Bible God or not I mean because it does take money from here and put it over there\nI didn't hear you clearly good historically student debt was not a bad idea okay um it is true that is a college degree you know if you get some skills along the way and if the market is as favorable to you will increase your you're earning power\nAnd a reasonable amount of debt for that is not a bad idea what we're getting into now is another one of these kind of\nYou know bubbly crisis kinds of things where there's an extreme amount of lending and um that part about getting the skills and going into a market you know is becoming weaker right now the quality of our education is going down the debt I get it all going up that ratios tipping at some point to where it's not going\nI mean some threats or some kind of debts are clearly kind of stupid right debt to finance consumption mirror consumption Sears you ought to be careful about that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "16"}
