petition which collected just shows have nine hundred thousand six inches had not reached the threshold for triggering of those\n[noise] and that's the latest BBC World news\nLooking to philosophy to the program that questions everything except your intelligence I'm John ... and I'm Ken Taylor we're here at the studios of KLW San Francisco [noise] continuing conversation to begin a philosophers corner at Stanford [noise]\nThat's where it can works she teaches he goes the committee meetings and all sorts of things\nAnd I just hang around and do for us [laughter]\nYou been doing ... today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice well the U.S\nLed to read it it has a long and sorry history when it comes to racial injustice that also has a long history of favoring the needs concerns and narratives of of white people over those are the people of color\nBut how are these two things white privilege and racial injustice related that's our question for this week well Philadelphia's\nJohn do ... do you think I mean just think about\nMen and boys little boys getting shot and killed over practically nothing all white people just aren't subject to this kind of crap and imagine if they were allowed to do you think the uproar\nWould be well you you get no disagreement from me on those facts can but do you have a point\nYes I Do have a point eliminate white privilege and was it the unequal treatment of whites and people of color and racial injustice just goes away white privilege is\nRacial injustice well I mean I'm just not convinced that the rampant mistreatment of blacks is an instance of or even proof of the existence of what you're calling white privilege come again well okay we're philosophers that start from the beginning of what exactly do you mean by white\nCriminal I mean the fact that white enjoy so many honored advantages relative to others not just in the criminal justice system but in just about any fear of life you can name\nJohn So you think the fact of whites are much more likely to be treated with respect by cops is a sign of honor and white privilege\nWell what did they do to deserve that privileged to be born in light you know racist society yeah I Do\nKnow they were born doesn't everybody black\nWhite brown anything in between deserve to be treated with respect just cars that are born of course they do what are they being born is all anyone ever has to do to deserve respect so it's not a problem I mean what are you trying to say I'm not sure what you're trying to say that you're misconstrue in two different things related but different\nViolations of black rights\nAnd protection of white privilege and I don't get it look I grant you that cops too often trample the rights of black people that's not to say that they don't trample the rights of white sometimes to or that they often treat everybody just as they should be treated\nBut violations of black rights are routine and are done with far a ... with impunity uh and and when whites are mistreated they're usually isn't in well you're just really my point no I'm refuting your point the problem isn't the cops are wrong to respect the rights of whites\nThe point is that are wrong to disrespect the rights of black\nClaim wait a minute are you denying that there's such a thing as white privilege\nNo not at all but I'm saying that having your rights are respected is not an example of white ... book can you order eliminate racial injustice\nDon't focus on white privilege right closing the country clubs or a a won't help much focus on securing the too often trampled rights of people of color okay\nPerks are belonging to the country club but but uh uh I'm a white supremacy is a lot more serious I got just a fact of\n... that you're making a nice them nice distinction will have a dig more deeply more deeply into them they're important distinctions but right now I'm going to remind our audience you're listening to philosophy talk and today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is eliminating white privilege to key to\nAchieving racial justice or is it really a matter of securing the rights of blacks\nDoesn't really matter whether we use the language of privilege or the language of rights to describe our racial situation can't we just try to fix it and forget about Samantha debates privileged writes injustice plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues\nYou can get a monthly e newsletter by taxing the word philosophy to two to eight to eight state current upcoming episode contests [noise] other philosophy talk that two to eight to eight messaging data rates may have a\nOn on the African American teenager was shot and killed in the next radiolab how many people do which they killed by the police each year our police shooting more black people and white people we don't know there's no national statistics on new and keeps accurate statistics on police shooting of ... other mothers who've lost their children\nI could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control that's on the next radiolab\nPresentation of radiolab this evening at ten depends on the conclusion of the San Francisco Unified School district board meaning will have gathered together coverage beginning at six PM at the conclusion of that meeting we will resume are regularly pre scheduled programing\nA public service from your friends and KLW bi monthly the San Francisco Unified School district board made\nThis little song that I'm thinking about the notice to [noise]\nEvery block and got to\nWhat was said uses if you\nAround\nGet back get back to that\nWas in place one line new law haven't found [noise] there's all mine red wine but they were not sell mean if you wind the R I give you stick around as you\nIt by a\nReally a privilege to be white and All right or is there a deeper wrong to write I John Perry this is philosophy talk the program that questions everything\nIncluding your poetry but not your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is the key to achieving racial justice eliminating white privilege or is it inventing black rights or to those amounted to the same thing our guest is Naomi ...\nFrom the University of Oregon a author of a white privilege and black rights\nSo now I mean I think we can all agree on the existence of a certain phenomena and these are various dimensions black people are often treated with less respect than white people and many contacts have less ... less access on average to the good things of life and all that everybody can agree about that phenomena\nBut practically speaking I Wonder why doesn't matter whether we describe this phenomenon in terms of white privilege or black right what does it matter practically speaking\nFrom matters because there's been an erosion due to a couple or or more a U.S Supreme Court rulings of um constitutional rights so the Fourth Amendment is supposed to give us all a protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the fourteenth amendment\nOr it's supposed to give everyone equal protection under the law\nNow these amendments are seem to have been violated in these recent high profile cases and uh uh the violators the killers are are not punish you know there are there not indicted or else they're not convicted but\nAre you saying that if we I mean okay ... that's all sounds right to me but there you go yeah ... ... ... it sounds like you're suggesting and I'm just trying to make clear whether you are not\nYou sound like you're suggesting if we adopt this discourse of white privilege instead of the discourse of of of of violations of black right we're going to be blind to exactly what's wrong what's going wrong in a situation\nThat's right you know the problem with it ... it was white privileges not the reality is that why you're better off I mean that is a problem but that's not what I'm disputing I'm just saying the discourse of white privilege especially when white people engage in this discourse\nIs kind of ... you know what it's like it's like it's like food is talking about how wonderful their meal is in response to hearing about world hunger\n[laughter] [laughter] well you say gee that sounds\nThat sounds like a pretty darn ing can I say the word damning uh uh uh in in ... indictment of it just goes to fight for and it also sounds like you think it is mostly white people you think ooh engaging the discourse of of of of\nOf white privilege and and but I Know why\nIt may not be for self serving reason it just may be oblivious or oblivious reasons oblivion um I ... I think one has to at this point to be a little delicate in in distinguishing Hussein\nBlack people talking about see how why to better off and talk about white privilege\nThen if white people in answer to a stark injustices start talking about how privileged they are and we're hearing a lot of that from otherwise well meaning white people that's what I'm trying to ... ah make a little intervention or concerning\n... Sunday on me philosophically speaking from Plato's Republic two roles theory of justice philosophers who think about justice tend to go off to thinking about an ideal society now I guess in an ideal society we certainly wouldn't be trampling the rights of blocks\nBut we also wouldn't have at least undeserved privileges for individual rights and know privileges for for people because of their race but it is focusing on an ideal society an ideal justice leading us to kind of\nBush to problems one of which is much more grave and serious than the other together [noise]\nWell yeah I mean you are self centered if we had an ideally just society we wouldn't have these discrepancies but we don't and if you actually look at real history not the history of philosophy but real history [noise] people don't care about justice what they care about is injustice\nSo you see that today you know the black lives matter movement ... didn't come out of a\nPhilosophy clubs wanting to perfect the chandelier of ideal justice hanging from selling the universe [laughter] I mean that came that came from an impassioned gut reaction to to blood on the street\nYou say you have quite a way with words I have to tell you that I Love your way with with what I Want to ask you a question I Want to ask a question though about what I mean I owe a ... we'll get back to the ideal versus a you know non ideal justice but I Want to I Want to focus on white people just for a little bit\n'cause there are lots of white people who will uh I don't like to generalize but there are lots of people who will acknowledge white privilege and they they take it to be a sign of their bona fides\nAs an ally to marginalized people that they are willing to acknowledge their white privilege there are others who will deny vehemently deny a white privilege they well they will turn to their own individual for a joint effort and blah blah blah so I mean it's a complicated thing and how I Wonder\nWhether the you think that those who deny what religion are those who who are willing to acknowledge white privilege or in any way morally different or the birds of a feather or the two sides of the same going or what\nWas political um it's political and I ... in several different levels I mean there are a number of whites who are pretty upset about issues of social injustice\nAnd they'll do more than just acknowledge that their privilege they may actually do some research of support some clauses that lead to legal reforms um and then there are whites who are sort of appalled who are comfortable who like to think of themselves as nice people\nAnd they suddenly become aware that their privilege because they're white and their response to social injustice\nFull schedule at lift quake dot O. R. G. [noise]\n[laughter]\n... lining with them and not and that they catch my eye and not directly plan our ethos jak\nShelters that so I look back now to\nGet a lot more than a week down\n\n\nBeyonce and a song called formation what she's saying at the super bowl [noise]\nAccording to Saturday Night live white people all over America were shocked to find out that beyond say was black or any rate a person of color some people thought the performance was too focused on race and identity politics\nWith white singer have the privilege of avoiding that kind of criticism I John Perry this is philosophy talk the program that questions\nEverything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor our guest is ... from the University of Oregon and we're thinking about white privilege and black rights\nSo Naomi or we want to go to a little bit a practical here but let me give you a kind of a a different example in the ... we've been using if I I I'm kind of old and my studies\nI Try to go to a hot club I'll be turned down a but by the guy at the door I feel bad about that I'll think young people have all these privileges they can they can read stuff and nine point fond slick and go to good clubs\nBut then if I beat up by the police for complaining or I Would feel much more serious problem was there you know my rights had been violated whereas in the earlier case may be just there was kind of an unfairness involved a little less serious [noise] now\nHow should philosophers ah think about these things or you know if we're not going to just do this kind of let's figure out the ideal society but let's figure out the basis for the difference is for the distinctions we made for things that are outrageous violations\nOf justice and things that are just kind of sad facts about our society how should we get started doing that\nWell I think there is a priority for a agree just violations of justice or if you're if you're talking if you're looking at the whole social political picture on the other hand if you're if you're a specialist in social philosophy and media studies or\nYou might not care that much and that's fine that's just not what you're working on but if you're looking at the society if you're looking at what's happening in contemporary times I think we have certain things that need to come first\nSo as as a practical example a lot of people think about how how should we think how do you think of affirmative action or in this context of privilege versus violation of rights might some people would think of affirmative action as breaking down\nBarriers of white privilege right rather than I mean nobody has a right to be admitted to there's not that the people in people's rights are being violated but certain structures of privilege of being broken down [noise] [noise]\nYeah I ... in that case I I think that one one of the results of white advantage you could call white privileges that if people are in a position of power they're going to use it for people they know so if you can uh\nUh admit students or or hire a other faculty you're going to go to to people like you to children and friends to two people you already know and if you're white it's likely be on the white people affirmative action and\nThat's called cronyism now affirmative action is a way of of a breaking into that and and creating more opportunities it's not\nIt's not just creating opportunities for people of color or for women it's it's creating opportunities in the structure it's it ain't going into that structure of cronyism which\nIs lined up with white privilege so that\nSounds like so you think that it sounds like it is that improving justice that is if you cronyism as anti trust is a kind of distributing I mean this is a kind of distribution of thing cronyism right who knew like distribute this club memberships to it's kind of ... that sounds unjust so it sounds like\nEven though you think a kind of justice is better served by the language of the pursuit of a kind of justice is better served by adopting the language of rights and protecting the right this is a sphere of justice in which\nA breaking down systems of privilege breaking down these distribution of systems is also a part of justice is is that right yes\nYeah there are different there are different forms of justices immediate justice you do not want the police to be able to come up to you or your children and shoot them on site that's extremely unjust I mean that's an emergency or a situation of injustice but you know there are white\nYou what you want if we if we have a democracy where to continue to work on having a democracy\nYou want everybody to have a a reasonable opportunity for the goods more than one of the ways that that can happen is to break into systems that are closed because of tradition or because of racial hierarchy\nAnd affirmative action is a way of doing that\nOkay that's that's good Charles from Montclair is on the line welcome to philosophies on Charles\n[laughter] yes I have a different take on this and I think it's more of a matter of cloth that if you are but we shouldn't America or part of the ...\n... ... ... ... you get to differently than if you're a poor white or black coal pull anything you put in the middle class\nAnd to give you an ... a former President George W book brought into Harvard Business school the coal you'll see difficult to get into the policy in the ... the students like\nNo you know could I Do this or do you do this but the same thing is they tend to tell you I I might have been able to earn a senior at Yale yes well I Would have to [laughter] I don't need to do that in both\nBut that was a long time ago it would be pretty hard to replicate George Bush's success don't advise young people coming up to rely on family connections to get them into Yale or however it doesn't work well let\nMe give you a different ... for the general Petraeus you know he was caught handing dismissed the secret okay until he pays a hundred thousand dollar fine and and now he's in pro if we can do to stop the shirt might go to the facts and making ... ...\nWhereas the whistle blower phones ... was put to sleep for the rest of his life by a foreign government\nNow is that a lot of different\nAh thanks for the call a job I'm going to turn this over and ask a Naomi what she thinks\nWell I think class on ... so far and then you run into issues of status up for example Henry Louis Gates was I'm African American professor at Harvard\nOr have had that incident a few years ago where he was stopped after returning trying to get into his own house who's got into an altercation with police was arrested [noise]\nUm [noise] a President Obama has been treated with incredible just respect or which after a while one can only conclude has that racial component it it it's not it's not class so yeah sure class\nAnd and you know classes not um [noise] one model is a matter of income I mean it has to culture and has to do is um networks of social capital education\nClass and money add class is important but it's not the whole story because um there have been studies on every level of class whites are better off than black on every socioeconomic yeah\nTo take you back to the distinction you made at the top but I I like but I Want to target it a little more uh you'd you distinguish white privilege or\nAs a system of perks from white supremacy as an ideology and all that and uh I get your distinction I think it's an important distinction uh but I Want to push you a little bit because I was recently reading some stuff of Cornell west\nAnd he diagnosed as a problem with the\nPresident Obama by saying President Obama refuses to address the fact you stupid afraid to address the fact that the U.S is still a white supremacist a society it's not legally so I mean the laws and at the same but the root problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San Francisco",
