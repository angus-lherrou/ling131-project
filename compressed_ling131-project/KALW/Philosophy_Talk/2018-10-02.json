joined now by captain told me she's a professor of philosophy at northern Arizona university and a contributor to game of Thrones in\nPhilosophy logic cuts deeper than swords Katie welcome to philosophy talk Hi thanks for having me\nSo Katy I Know you've been a fan not just a fan of game of Thrones but you published about game of Thrones so so what is it about this show the lens it to a philosophical analysis\n[noise] well I think that I'm particularly drawn to the different characters in game of Thrones and how they represent different an ethical issues or even a different ethical principles so in the publication that I had for game of Thrones and philosophy I talked about scenarios and her\nSort of encounters with just rocky and cultural relativism um I think in more recent seasons I'm I'm interested in um portrayals of um gender and race\nOr inability um that serious of the different characters represent like Syrian and Thursday and so I think it's really just like the rich character is that like lend themselves really while Tift also\nJust and I mean the issue of gender is fascinating because you know if you think about the way the show's evolved it starts out with most of the female characters being present just basically passive victims of ... there are circumstances\nAnd by now we're living more or less than a golf course right you have all these powerful not necessarily always morally pure Thursday right\nAri to some extent but uh it's not something that's been of interest to UK cheapest sort of a gradual evolution of a plot over the the seasons that we've seen\nYeah I have to say that one of the things that drew me to a game of Thrones is the fact that there are like are so many rich female characters like I have you know grew up reading\nFantasy and watching fantasy movies where women are often lacking in in game of Thrones you have so many interesting female characters and that's not to say that like representations of gender always like\nI don't know praise worthy but um it's really interesting how like we can take to narratives to sort of classic example she starts is this like you said passive character who's just sort of\nYou know a victim of circumstances where all these different not in her life her brother um called pogo um are just telling her what to do essentially and then we see her develop into an individual and the kind of moral decisions that she has to make later on and how she becomes a leader that people both\nLove and respect without losing any kind of um I guess like stereotypical femininity so like the nearest represents herself as a as a mother she's the mother to everyone so she's like fully feminine and has some ethical and quality\nThat well I haven't seen a drag in the ... century until my children were food\nBut don't rocky hadn't seen\nThey did for me\nI was born to ...\nLet me ask you a question about ... ... you mean a how many people had she burned with her dragons I don't know and be any by what rights they had it coming can buy what rights the she rule\nIn ... in West rose I mean what's her what's her and she comes with a dragons and force and she ... ... ... many many people with their army right so I mean she does have a complicated ark and sometimes she her art looks like\nThe evolution from a victim to kind of liberating hero but then she makes all these mistakes he makes a terrible terrible deadly mistakes and then put what right let's see claim any right to rule over the people of West rose ... to whom she basically says submit or die\nI don't know about that I don't know the classic femininity I that's something else that the monster\nWell I think that um will do a lot of lot of things um you said they're they're interesting so I think one thing it's like she always sees her people at in terms of the sort of like mother child relationship you know there's that scene which is highly problematic at the end of season three where everyone is calling her her my\nMother [noise]\nOne of the great things about game of Thrones is that you have a character like the nearest one the one hand is like super sympathetic character we really want to like hurt in season one\nAnd she has these dragons and this like mythical background and it's really cool on the other hand I'm like you mentioned what right does she have to go in like conquer all these cities um this is something I talk about with my my students when I when I'm teaching ethics like is it okay\nAh in sort of white colonialist fashion to go and demolish these civilizations even in the name of like anti slavery\nBut does raise it I mean it's a question I think it feels like a general question the show which is the question of legitimacy\nHow does power different all achieved ... you have all these different models exactly of social organization you kind of loose affiliation the wild wings ... all the way up to kind of a tyranny under Joffrey and even if a tiny little bit of democracy of the wall so\nRuling is really um especially interesting with the ... so it's the same thing with the wild things where it's like they kind of electric who is going to be the best ruler that was ... months raider but um and then they refused to be a part of like the the west coast um seven kingdoms and on the one hand we think the wild things are bad because they kill Stark's\nAnd and you know trying to catch them or whatever um but then also with with John's arc we see oh those are actually like really interesting people and maybe this is a better style of government than white where we're seeing elsewhere\nSo I I think game of Thrones makes it kind of an open question about what sorts of encounters with otherness are um things that we can accept and things that we can't so like when we encounter other groups of people maybe there are certain practices that we should be like okay you know maybe you eat\nYou know horse hearts and that's part of your religion fine that's cool [laughter]\nBut if like rape and pillage is part of your um your cultural practice maybe we should draw the line there and it's not entirely clear where that line is and it seems like it bends throughout the show um but I think that's also true with with life in general so I don't think it with her and says like giving us any answers but it is raising these questions that are the for interesting\nThat leads me to cut costs are consequences question if the world is really messed up is it about to be good because you know ... book is a terrible world than you might think that if you compromise a little bit and just being a little bit corrupt in the long run things would have worked out\nBut yeah yeah there's a scene where I'm friendly brass and you know goes up to send that and it's like hey what we need to do Robert is dead we need to you know capture surfing and take her children\nWe must get Joffrey away from his mother into custody protector of the ... he hopes the king holds the kingdom [noise] every moment like this you know the moment for pay\nFor the ... ... troops from both civil\nAnd your mind like yes take that deal it's a good deal but you know I don't know I think that's that's a that's challenging because\nYou I think like OK well would that really work out is it okay for net to sort of stick with his values I mean obviously it's bad for him he ends up compromising a little bit because he lives in order to save his children so maybe that's like some\nKind of middle ground I don't know um I think that the ... many of the stark women represent a different kind of morality so you have catlin um who seems you know she isn't this kind of consequences list or the entourage will think or\nIf we were to pick catlin in a sort of moral theory she would be a carrot assess which he really cares about her family and what's close to her\nUm Enron I mean maybe are yeah it's sort of similar [laughter] and this in the sense that she's fighting\nFor like her family I don't know I'm is revenge apart of KERA ethics I don't know so what did you\nHappen to a tree I so starting in the beginning I had this like beautiful story in my mind like generic is becoming their rightful ruler of Syrian by her side\nUm I wasn't really into her getting married I kind of like the idea of hardest on her own\nI don't know I I think that she's going to like sacrifice herself I think that'd be the best art for her um and I think maybe most of the characters will but I I honestly have no no idea I I just want to be surprised I wanted to unlock hamlet with carnage everywhere\nKeeps reminding us the only reality that matters is the reality out there outside of the fiction whereas other characters want to stay within the fiction which of course to divorce is just as she says at one point another gilded cage when are you going to realize that which is really irregular replaceable right and so there's that there's some\nCentral weight and so I think all of these things are great ways to have an experience through which we learn things ourselves and in a way it gets back to your point about the mistake with in the show that men and black\nMakes the the show is not\nGonna teach us some lessons it's going to allow us to discover things about ourselves learn things grow maybe I'm In the way that that other people and they understand fiction within the show\nNo jury well thanks so much for helping us think through Westworld together today it's been fantastic having you back on the show thank you Josh thank you Ken\nThis was great in\nDenver and philosophy at George ... or helping us thinking deeply above the hit TV show what world you're listening to philosophy drug it's the new golden age of television\nAnd our next segment will jump to listen to their favorite program we'll also talk to someone who is being of all things philosophical consulted on major TV show\nPhilosophers on the scent and in our audience when ... [noise]\nTune into cross currents today at five we'll hear how a San Francisco murals connect bay area residents to Palestinian culture and realities\nYou know I think the laws and important one because of his connections to you know what's happening here on the border in America and this whole thing with Trump and his well [noise]\nPlus our one on one talks with the mayoral candidates at Oakland continue today at five on cross currents from KLW needs [noise]\nIn the Nineteen fifties the girl who took part radios for fun wanted to tackle advanced math for guidance counselor had other ideas why do you want to take calculus to just going to grow up and have the ... how she became a pioneering astronomer any way on the next big picture science [noise]\nComing up here on K. A. L. W. stay with us [noise]\n...\nI'm Josh loudly and this is philosophies on the program and questions everything exams your intelligence I'm ... and we're thinking about some of the most philosophically component programs in the new golden age of television\nWe're joined now by Pamela here on to me she's a professor of philosophy at UCLA and get this she has worked as philosophical consultant for NBC show the good place Pamela welcome back to philosophy talk thank you so much\nSo maybe it's because I don't live in LA and Hollywood but you know I don't know too many philosophers who a bit like had a hand in ah making TV or movies or anything like that so how did that happen is that just that just something you uh LA philosophers do\nNot at this level um so it is a case that I often at once or twice a year or get a email from somebody who's interested in an idea that they have for a TV show or a movie\nAnd if I if I have time I usually um like to talk to them just 'cause it's fun and interesting so I got an email I'm like this about what turned out from Mike sure who um I didn't know who he was but I I said sure\nI Would be happy to and then um and then others that were preparing for the\nMeeting I looked him up and I thought wow this this is the person from parks and recreation of a big yeah I'm so we met at a local coffee shop for and and just talked about his idea for um for maybe three hours which was extremely fun fun topic and then uh when when the show a\nCame up for the second season they invited me back or they actually invited me to the studio to the writers' room and I got to speak with the uh the entire\nRoom full of of writers which was which was also extremely fun\nSo tell us about the premise of the show and tell us a little bit more about how you help them a shape the show\nOr so the the premise that show opens with Eleanor I'm who arrives at quote the good place I'm so she's died\nAnd she has met by Michael who is the architect of the good place and ah Michael explained to her that she has arrived at the good place and um and starts to show her around but a Eleanor knows that there's been a mistake because Eleanor knows that she was not a good person and so I'm really shouldn't be in a good place\nI honestly think I Would have by mistake because Michael called me Eleanor shelf drops so he knows I'm Me he's just\nWrong about my overall quality level\nShe's hooked up as everybody is with her I suppose it's soul mate who is chi\nChi is a professor of ethics and moral philosophy when she introduced himself in that way on the show when I watched it I cracked up a ... treaty as her soul mate and Eleanor convinces cheating to promise her that he won't\nTurn her end or reveal her secret but that ... that he will help her to become a better person so that she might stay in the good place\nTo wait a minute GD he's a moral philosopher react vote he engages with is not good person to hide her not good news\nHelp her yeah so then things start going terribly wrong and the good place and Eleanor I'm has the suspicion that it's because of her presence I'm On the show takes off from that\nBut what makes sure was interested in when he was conceiving of the show and and I think the reason he um reached out to me was the um puzzles and difficulties about how\nAll right with the motivation to be a good person and and so I had a a draft about that puzzle on my on my website and I and I believe he just came across that and then wanted to to talk to me about it that's great\nThat's a lovely question right so it's not just a question about what the ... right moral principles are and how you to bootstrap yourself into any kind of moral sentiment\nThat's the real question and a Eleanor has had led a very problematic life\nAnd then none of them are good people there they're all problematic people here's my question though why the afterlife why don't why not tell a story about people struggling to become good through their lives I mean what was the point of setting this in this problematic afterlife\nThat's a great question my guess and I I I did not speak with Mike about that question but my guess is that he was very interested in having this points system and thinking about how much good a person had done in the course of their lives and comparing people\nWhen your time under cars and we calculate the value of your life using are perfectly accurate measurements is\nOnly the people at the very highest score the true cream of the crop to come here to the good what happens if everyone else you I Do worry about\nLater in the show um some contractual is that philosophers show up and um and I like to think that was some bit of my influence to to get them thinking\nYou know not just about I'm producing good doing good things are producing good outcomes but also\nUm you know several of Eleanor is a first flashbacks are ways in which she's a ... it's called the free rider where she's trying to never have to be the designated driver or what have you and especially now towards the end of season to\nThe importance of the quality of their relationships with one another and the importance of that to the original question of how it is that we become better people is really starting to come together so I was very pleased to see that\nI thought you might say 'cause it doesn't play so much a little bit with\nThe nature of divinity and all that right I mean no right\n'cause you know she even gets in there by mistake because of what kind of divinity as that but a great play with that very much but I but another dog is not really she's in a bad place by design nothing good place on I Know but we do know that really that was a spoiler [laughter] that deal the but here's the thought I thought that maybe\nI think there are several system where you can't judge a life\nOr do you have the whole life before you do write edging the goodness of a life is only after it's done maybe that's part of the thought\nIt could be it could be um I think the idea was just that um we're used to thinking about judging a person's moral goodness from the standpoint of the eternal judge or from God or from religion and so that just gave a a real focus probably to the to the question he wanted to consider\nThat makes sense plus it lets him has that flying shrimp than you know crazy things\n[laughter] so I wanted to ask you another question that's gonna depend on a a spoiler again you know listeners close your ears for a second if you haven't caught our way out but\nI really I Love the way in which a GED\nStarts out the show as a kind of authority on moral behavior but little by little you start to realize that in fact all of his moral knowledge\nHasn't or help them to be a morally good person and in fact it seems as though we're at certain points it's actually being in the way because he thinks too much over analyzing see as experiences moral dumb founding and and so in fact the oldest moral philosophy isn't any good for us", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02"}
