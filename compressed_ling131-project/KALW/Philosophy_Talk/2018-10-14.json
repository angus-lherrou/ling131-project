BBC nice\nWelcome who philosophy talked a program that questions everything except your intelligence I'm John Perry and I'm Ken Taylor we're coming to you from the studios of KLW San Francisco\nWe're continuing conversations that begin a philosophers corner at Stanford University that's where ... teaches philosophy and I did for about forty years\nAnd today we're thinking about the ethics of international debt can or something\nLike two hundred trillion dollars of debt worldwide uh that doesn't include the solar generator I bought from Amazon yesterday but the real problem is that there are twenty four nations in crisis 'cause they can't pay off their debts and a lot of the I mean some of these debtor nations are\nWants to rich nations like grief or Finland but a lot of them are poor developing a nations where where the burden of debt is falling mostly on the poor and the disenfranchised all told John it's a massive tragedy of massive human tragedy well\nSo you and I can sit here and moan and well about the tragedy but as philosophers what do we have to add we're not bankers or politicians\nOur job is to analyze concepts not loan money well then let's start by doing what we do best left to analyze the concept of death and then maybe that will get a similar interest in much the jelly well it doesn't seem like the most mysterious concept first you've got a debtor who borrows money and uses it\nAnd promises to repay with interest then there's a creditor who lends money loses the use of it but expects to be repaid with interest that seems a pretty good start as far as it goes to thank you\nIn the right circumstances can that can be an extremely good saying it allows people to buy houses students to go to college entrepreneur starting new businesses\nAnd it allows the lender to make a profit while simultaneously serving the broader social good with his money or their money ... every time amount everywhere\nIn history has that been thought to be true John I mean the Bible seems to condemn used every and Shakespeare famously declares that one shouldn't either Obama or no or a lender beach I'm well well well did they get it wrong\nBelieve Shakespeare ended up penniless with me but yeah I think they're just wrong in the right circumstances dead as a fair rational ineffective means of making good things happen you make it sound so soon\nDebt case that it doesn't seem to me to work that way up at all I mean your analysis assume that we at the same age in\nWho takes out the loan then later as to either repaired or face the consequences of non repayment so it's that one agents rational calculations but you know someone happens in the case of international debt when countries take out loans not not at all yeah you're you're\nYou're worried about international debt so you know some leader takes out a debt uses it gets very popular than generations later somebody has to repay that's a good point\nYeah and that is is it is one of the problem because the leaders you negotiate it the low a loan and for whatever reason aren't necessarily the same as a lender who has to make the decision to pay it back or not pay it back when you know the chickens finally come home to roost maybe decades later it can be a mess ... leaders\nCome and go uh but nations endure conceptually it's the nation that's the agent in these cases the agent to borrow or the repair is one thing the the the nation\nWell I knew that kind of what you have to say to make your analysis work done but that doesn't change the fact that the people who have to make is a fundamental fact that people have to make these really painful decisions\nAnd you're listening to love to cook today we're thinking about the ethics of international debt\nIt's a simple model of debt doesn't scale up to the level of nations we need a better model we look at some possibilities in the next segment debt default and national despair and disaster\nPhilosophy talks community of thinkers

expecting to get repaid\nWhether it's bill Joe or an entire nation that's our focus today I'm John Perry this is philosophy talk program that questions everything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor\nAnd we're thinking about the ethics of international debt our guest is Julie Nelson author of economics for human so do we want to get to like\nHow to think about this that simple model that Jon talked about and whether it's killed up and wants to write model but I Want to ask about ground question first and then we'll dig\nInto that one back of my background question is does or does\nThe world need a regime of international lending and borrowing I mean the American economy couldn't run without a barrel ring and lending could the world economy run without there being credit into that\nI'm probably not there probably isn't a need for some kind of system or what we have not with us [laughter] you're using the word system it's kind of an exaggeration um it's a pretty much chaos out there\nIt's chaos out there so we need a better system but it's not not all that is I'm just trying to get the John said the world war two debt is a good thing I mean\nThere there are there are ... that are responsible and and reasonable the the sort of fun yeah good debt which is one small subset is a debt that is a a lending money that goes into productive\nUm services that then when you look back on natural now to increase or paying back a principal in the interest isn't a problem if you use that that loan or to do something really a productive um that's not the case for a lot of the ah the international anyway\nUh interest rate for a poor country that borrows a lot of money\n[noise] it depends on who they are getting the loans from um right now a global interest rates are quite low so there's actually quite a lot of money floating around looking for some place to live there you know earn any interest at all or so a lot of poor countries have been I'm filling up on cheap a lending\nThis is now is because our Federal Reserve has the interest rates so low that just kind of right standard all over the world\nOkay so this is a good time to borrow money or if you're a poor country will fill you still have to pay it back I Want to go\nBack to John's regional thoughts so I ask him we're losing conceptual now who's as what we philosophers do ride in a normal person to person or person to institution transaction and there's a lender up or you know I borrow money from you you lend money for me were each rational calculators were acting on our own self interest\nRight and economic says a lot to say about transactions between rational calculators acting on each acting on his or her own self interest I mean some people think that the in the tire foundation of economic theory but it just doesn't seem to me just scale of\nThe nation of ... nations right it just doesn't it doesn't doesn't work at all\nWell in the in the receiving nations here that the person's signing on for the country as a whole is usually some finance minister\nNow the finance minister it might be signing on to uh to get a loan that's going to fund a project owned by his brother in law now that's not not a atypical I'm sort of situation a lot of cases and yet he was going to pay that back um there's been a limits on on uh how much for\nMoney tends to move very really among among a country so the the profits if there are any from that could be in a Swiss bank account by the time that the loan comes to pay back so it's a lot of current pay that back then is\nWhy there's a lot of it and as one of the issues ... is one of the issues um and even if it's not corrupt it tends to be very uh non transparent on that as a people of the country rarely get any kind of a direct say or even know you know necessarily what their government is is putting them and for the\nWorst OK so Greece's in this debt crisis is it is it better or worse I mean dictatorships aren't at all responsive\nOr ... or well let's see they don't have to be directly responsive to the will of the people I Do think they have to be\nTo some extent in the long term responsive to the will of the people that are or they have to have totalitarian force that says screw you people I don't care what you think but democracies you think of as\nThere'll be built in mechanisms that make the government responsive to the will of the people so is it worse for democracies as opposed to a totalitarian dictatorial states at all\nWell I think it can be very problematic for or or even for democracy is um there is a category sometimes people refer to odious adapt as it you know a dictator borrows money and use it to slaughter the wrong people very hard to see that as in any way you know ethical up that people should have to pay it back\nOn but sometimes it says well democracy that everything should be fine um yeah but democracies have a elites are they have wide ranges of inequality there people with more power less power a democracy can easily oppress minority right\nUm it's not like democracy is are you know there are all fair and equal you know even in democratic societies who pays and who you know profits from alone can be buried\nSo it's a fraught situation you're listening to philosophy talk we're talking about the ethics of international debt we'd love to have you join this conversation learned does your thoughts and will be forever indebted to you and Lisa from San Francisco's inland more comfortable as we talked Lisa what's your comment or question for\nUs that like comedies um well I my mother was trillion\nAnd the way the media has captured the issue of that are saying that if the irresponsible countries and things like that are completely\nForget that the economic there's an economic terrorism also applied by these financial institutions against a emerging democracies the ones that the ... the socialist democracies that happened in ... during the year and the government what he had his credit cut off by the world bank\nAnd in fact I'm for example John Perkins who was the chief economist at an international consulting firm where he was hit by the world bank the eye and that U.S Treasury department he wrote a book called confessions of an economic hit man when he detailed very specifically about how these financial institutions\nAre actually ruined the country's economies the ones that they were feeding me from um you know most in the post colonial or near colonial countries and by by ruining their national industry is making it impossible for them to even pay back loans to begin with\nThe ethics issue has a lot more than just ethics it has to do with world dominance by these major financial institutions that are controlled by the major powers in\nIn the world thanks for the call is though that's a lot there to for a two to respond to what ... what do you think Julie I mean what are you in ... as a lot of thought there would be go wherever you are\nRight well I I had been talking about things from the get the side of the receipt in countries but that that very simple story about credit or a lender contract ah also doesn't hold up very well from the a side giving alone I also mentioned already mentioned expert promotion has nothing to do with the you know the wellbeing of the country and not\nReally a lot about um expectation of being paid back\nAnd you think when countries loan money or multilateral institutions uh ... yeah lend money they want to get that interest back\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nDidn't ask things in life for free [noise] you can get them to their badge and bees\n\nWow everyone wants money everyone needs money but when nations have to borrow money often becomes a crippling debt are John Perry this is philosophy talk to a program that questions everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm going to and I want money with no interest or just ... through of economics for humans and we're thinking about the ethics of international debt\nOkay Julia Baird comes the opportunity of a lifetime we're going to make use are for a day of the whole world all the economies and everything I drink or for however long it takes to get to do with the international debt crisis so what is the first thing you're going to do\nUh get I get to do several things right I've got to go hang out and you know [laughter]\n... the first thing has to do with with the debt cancelation which is the thing that can be done uh immediately but but is really a a band aid for the longer run situation as long as there's an irresponsible lending going on\nAnd irresponsible borrowing or or borrowing ... being done under pressure\nUm the problem is going to continue shouldn't the other two things that need to happen is um\n[noise] one for the poor country to shift in the way that that age has given uh right now a lot of you know seemingly humanitarian aid has given in terms of loans as I said let alone have to be paid back with interest and not only that they have to be paid back usually in dollars you know or euros or whatever the the lending\nCurrency was and you're not going to get that kind of pay back all over you know from from\nA very basic you know health and education kind of expensive so that kind of really needs to be be moved to ... you know and then the third thing that that I've referred to a few times is is this better structure for the international financial system so we we don't have this wild west out there that there are orderly ways\nTo settle you know a century international bankruptcy without the total lack of disorder and agrees case\nI think if you ask most Americans are making this poll up but I think it's true I think if you were to ask this is hopeful as reducing the counterfactual polls and they give you were to us most American whether foreign aid is like charity just a gift\nOr a loan I Wish they address I bet you most Americans think that foreign aid is again that's why they're so the weather's all both do why are we giving so into into all this foreign aid when we got all this problem but ... most foreign aid is mostly in the ... is that not through foreign aid is most people\nDon't have little kids in front of me but there there's a substantial chunks are informed alone or um yeah when it is a grant the grant may be very much tied to um you know and maybe in the form of weapons or other\nUh agencies ever taken a stand against is completely what seems to me completing the ferries idea\nOf of ah loaning money on the condition to you buy weapons or on that\nSpecific issue I'm not sure let me I'm going to every there had been some efforts at from the UN agencies to to try to get to some better financial structures\nUm some ways of a structure and renegotiation of a sovereign debt I\nWant to hear about the only to share a lot of back up to what you said about inter er irresponsible borrowing\nOn Monday Night because the irresponsibility responsibilities kind of in the eye of the beholder suppose I'm a policymaker\nA decision maker at a high level and the government I I'm not like a banker who views are not necessarily like a banker who are ... who views the return on investment necessarily in monetary terms but I may I may realize you could come through the ...\nTwenty years down the road there's going to be a problem with getting this money back but\nThat is for ... lending is for me an instrument of broader public policy I may get this guy on my side in the battle against the comedies or whatever and yeah you know I don't know if you go to do with it and then I ever going to get it back when I may not get it back but it's worth it to me\nTo get to take to get him to do my political ... I mean how much of an international lending\nIs driven by broader policy aims that are not necessarily tied to adjust\nThe economics of of of what are you going to get the money back\nI Would I get a very large part of it I mean a very large chunks of loans have no real reasonable expectation that they could be paid back again they're going into things that are not going to have you know pay back in hard currency\nThey're going to export credit which is more about selling things from not a given country then you know than helping uh creating a productive capacity and they're receiving one or there about um you know gaining control and being able to put in a various kinds of you know a neo liberal policies like the eye and\nSo if it if the legendary lending nations are thinking of that as that way as an instrument of policy rather than just a financial transaction\nLet's go let's call it ... it it's an instrument of control\n... that's what it is it's not just instrumental pop policy it's an instrument of power that says\nIf I can do this I can get the power over this country or to make them do things my way so I don't know maybe ... percent on that would be a good yeah yeah maybe it's a corrupt country and I'm trying to clean things up or maybe I just want to open that country's markets you know to a bunch of them I don't want to private companies on by my cronies\nBecause what I'm Wondering is suppose I'm now I suppose I'm a citizen and I'm thinking about my country in the world as a as a lender right and I'm thinking about my should I object\nBecause should I object to my country wanting to exercise its power through this\nIt's a it's kind of subversive corrosive instrument or should I say on moral grounds because I stand with the party of humanity don't do that country I mean I'm not opposed to an international market but it's a free and fair market but manipulate I'm just trying to figure out how I as a citizen\nShould think about my country that does this stuff and I want you to help\nOur leaders to not do that stuff [laughter] right I mean I think there is a real moral and ethical issue here um when we're talking about doing the kinds of a financial arrangements here that ended up um really bullying and impoverishing or other a weaker countries\nSo Julian ... another debt crisis it's getting a lot of news lately and I would my ten grandchildren I think about it a lot [laughter] is this student debt crisis only one that that Bernice\nQuite take care of so completely is burning and the Republicans are I guess going to pretty much ignore or does it have some similarities with the international debt crisis\nI think it does like again that model of you know a creditor debtor contract and yeah the ethical thing to do is pay back for that\nBecause it was entered into rationally what's good information although that again breaks down um [noise] the levels of debt that students are getting into now are are quite incredible on the idea that ah you know an Eighteen year old is going to be able to mortgage away their life you know we know the brain is not\nQuite you know fully formed at that age and you were telling people to you know that they have the right yeah that that they should do this\nAnd working at a university I Know that a lot of the um [noise] ah the kind of going thing now it's oh yeah we can raise tuition and fees will just raise the financial aid packages by which they mean alone aspect to it becomes a way of expanding a universities expanding um you know administrators salaries\nAre all of these kinds of things I'm On the backs of students\n[noise] yeah so you know but I I'm of many minds about this stuff and I I mean I don't I still hear them any hand any kind of get a ... I still don't think a debt is intrinsic lending and borrowing is intrinsically bad ... Shakespeare got it wrong the Bible God or not\nI mean because it does take money from here and put it over there\nI didn't hear don't you don't really go to the student debt was not a bad idea okay um it is true that is a college degree you know if you get some skills along the way and if the market is is favorable to you will increase your you're earning power\nAnd a reasonable amount of debt for that is not a bad idea what we're getting into now is another one of these kind of\nYou know bubbly crisis kinds of things where there's an extreme amount of lending and um that part about getting the skills and going into a market you know is becoming weaker right now the quality of our education is going down the debt to get it going up that race has tipping at some point to where it's not going to\nBe I mean some threats or some kind of desert clearly kind of stupid right debt to finance consumption mirror consumption Sears", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "14"}
