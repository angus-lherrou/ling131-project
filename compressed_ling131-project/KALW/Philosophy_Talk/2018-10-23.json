statements they condemned the killing of Mr ... in the strongest possible terms they called for a critical transparent prompt investigation or the full account of how the journalists died\nThey said there is responsible must be held to account and Saudi Arabia in this put measures in place to ensure something like this could never happen again but the ministers did not say what action that governments would do once all the facts and learn on that unity would be probably harder to find\nPresident Trump's national security adviser John Bolton this war and Russia not to interfere with us elections speaking in Moscow after talks with President Putin He's had passed interference by Russian hackers was objectionable which had no bearing on the results\nWere obviously monitoring potential foreign interference in our elections are across the board very closely we have two weeks ago until the election\nI Hope there is any meddling at all but it's worth noting that the press signed that executive order about a month ago that will require a report from the director of national intelligence within forty five days\nAfter the election on whether any meddling took place\n... confirmed the two presidents whom each in from a few days after the vote\nThe b._b._c. is the second in command of the Islamic state group in Somalia has been killed in the capital Mogadishu ... who's in the U.S

democracy climate deniers know addicted to fossil fuels\nReligious fanatics who see unspeakable evil axis like there to get the paradise that you know the forces of under reason they're everywhere\nForces wherever you sound like some kind of men and can like you can have this cosmic baffled as the forces of darkness in the forces of light well yeah of course there is well okay so you see it that way at least it might come as some comfort to know that those forces of darkness have been losing ever since the end like\nCome on how do you explain the current political situation in the United states a breakfast in your own homeland or the mess up in the middle east how do you explain that to him\nYeah OK but they take a longer view I mean think about the abolition of slavery or the the rise of democracy the defeat of fascism colonialism stalling isn't or not to mention progress in science technology medicine I mean all these things are ... the reason can\nYeah yeah yeah chess but like take the Nazis for example they weren't argued out of existence\nThey weren't blood didn't do\nAll right let the force of the reasons sometimes need help from other kinds of I grant you that\nYou have like a force of arms by the way without the red army Stalin's Red Army\nHe would have never been up so I'm going to ask you why did you put communism on your list of defeated horrible it's all in his installing was amongst\nOh yeah but Mark's he was as much a man of the enlightenment as best you so admire I Know is Adam Smith or Emanuel kind of I mean look he believed in scientific rationality he was opposed to religious dogma he was a huge advocate for human dignity so\nYeah well yeah Marxism is wonderful in theory the great theory but in practice unfortunately it also gave us the gulag mouths culture revolution which just goes to show you John you should not shies reason nobody who do we wait you're blaming the gulag on reason\nWell Stalin had his scientists and engineers right I mean they are here to the candidates of scientific rationality otherwise it could have done their thing I had this huge collection of party operatic they manage this\nFor all the state I think they did that by standard bureaucratic rationality how exactly do\nYou think the great leader a control this group of Oso rational ...\nWill he can like in any large organization\nVarious rational in something rational incentives like fear and intimidation I mean these aren't your everyday tools rational manning\nIf one thing the Nazis actually did believe in a in a in a large number of unreasonable things together with their uh repugnant value I've not diary Jewish lives they believe that Jews stabbed Germany in the back of an effort entered World War one they believe that the Jews were ... biologically different species\nWhose blood would contaminate gentile a number of at least that are actually are are factually incorrect\nIn addition the fact that they would a ... jail or shoot people who disagreed with them is it's so facto evidence that their belief system was not based on recent because if it was they'd be happy to let the argument percent of the argument\nAnd they're really using the tools of of an irrational and you you you look at footage of Hitler giving giving speeches you don't think that's a rational guy\nClearly Philly is probably the reading too much analytic philosophy he's crazy no Hitler's crazy but it's not just crazy he's also the exploiting irrational tendencies on the part of irrational irrational fences what part of the people\nYou know it's pretty good at just ... I just I mean again I don't share his ... but he was pretty good at adjusting means the end\nBut so this is this a lot of digging I'll remind you this is philosophy dog it was coming to you from ... in Menlo Park or gas to them and now I'm Talking to scientists even thinking and our next segment we're going to take a deeper look the nature of reason is it the only guy the true and the good is there even\nAlways one thing that's reasonable to do or believe in the first place or or does it depend on where we stand\nProbing the nature of reason along with questions from our live and reasonable audience when philosophy talk it continues [noise]\n\nThe last time we talk on the local public radio KLW would like to take just a moment to think a couple of the local businesses that provide it treats for our volunteers and staff during our recent membership Dr including Amy's spaghetti shack\nFor spaghetti and meat as well as Reagan meatballs and long bridge pizza company for a thin crust sour dough pizzas next time you visit please thank them for supporting King I love you you can find links to these and our other food donors on our website K. A. L. W. dot ORG Mm\n\nMm\n\nI mean\nNow again then\nYou know\n\nPack of ...\nJeeze\n\nThanks to our musical guest Tiffany Austin an out of showman this this philosophy talk I'm Josh and that\nAnd I'm content or I guess is even kicker and we're asking whether reason and save us\nCan reason only tell us not to achieve our ultimate aims are kind of also tell us what ultimate aims are worth adopting join the conversation like raising your hand and the Macron will come around to\nSee so look philosophers have talked about the nature of reason for a long long time way Aristotle Plato or none of that's been what scientific and was like up reorient and do it I Want you to put your cognitive scientist Adam and some of the perspective of cognitive science oh should we think of\nA reason in this in this twenty first century is it like ... capacity was Descartes right with Plato right is it a bundle of distinct capacity tell us the most astounding thing that's happening scientist\n... discovered about reason\nThere's systematic discrepancies between reasoning that is how the human mind proceeds left to its own devices and resigned in the sense of our best understanding of what follows from what a long list of discrepancies between how we think and how we ought to\nThink so there's like there's normative uh ... how we ought to be what counts as good as friends lost his reveling that stuff that norms of rationality right and you're saying\nThe striking thing that comes to scientists discovered is that we don't live up to those norms upbringing if not designed to live up to ...\nI'm ... now of course it can't be the case that were incapable of rationality otherwise we'd never be able to make the argument that people are systematically irrational because we wouldn't have a benchmark rationality against which to compare the human\nGlue make that argument people like you know what I like that really [laughter] I mean you're the world right now the scientist you bucket argument what about the ordinary or\nWere you you the argument would be incoherent that unless we had a standard what rationality was you could say people are irrational because there'd be no such thing as rationality and we wouldn't be able to have a conversation in the\nFirst place or a conversation about anything else that you wouldn't be able to have this program if there wasn't a standard of rationality that you are exercising\nAnd things like ... I mean I agree and it seems like the question then is okay how do we get from one to see how do we get from a flawed everyday reasoning ... this more normative standard reason\nLike a free speech like open debate like the uh avoidance of fallacies like arguing ad hominem or arguing from the historical origin of a an argument\nThat demand that if a claim isn't periodically be confronted against evidence or from the world all the things that aren't terribly natural to us but once we implemented them we've seen that collectively they make a smarter than any one of us is individual\nThat's what I was gonna say collectively cause some stuff you were talking about requires kind of collective structures but my vision\nRight is it gets half city in the in my brain I open my eyes I focus I see the clock I Need your help to see the clock but I'm a new job to see that it's a clock 'cause I Need the concept I didn't get that\nBut my hearing doesn't require your aid I mean sort of reason is some like capacity in my brain why do I need the help of all you guys to ah stay on track\nWell in fact one of the fundamental on discovery for philosophy is that I that naive realism just opening your eyes and seeing the world as it is is false that Ari about their sexual illusions in just as there are cases what our eyes to see that there are cases where our minds to see us\nYou've got to show where your eyes to see you pull out a yardstick you are you better methods of a ... and the same thing for logical\nWell but there's something there's a capacity in my brain for vision is a capacity in my brain for audition for sensing things up right from sensory motor coordination that's inviting brain right and it just kind of runs that there are illusions in like that but is there a capacity in my brain\nBecause all that stuff you talk about about corruption and the norms that doesn't seem like it's just in my brain it somehow in on the chili unlimited votes\nCan I mean so I mean I think the norms institutions was a really important to deep one right that collectively we can achieve much more uh in in the demand reason that we can individually\nBut you know you're encountering in one way to re comments to say oh my God\nWe're all system we're all just blindly distinguish but did you make a dancer monitors assist right behind him so Donna Karan has has makes me just a woman just sort of our our automatic a kind of a risk stick a very flawed way of uh a person in the data from the world\nBut we also have system too which is our reasoning where we can we can actually reflect on and say oh\nWell boy a destroying my drink looks back\nBut I guess maybe it isn't actually yes I can find a reason you know I I tend to agree with Steve that even as an individual level or nothing to do because we've got our system to even as I mean I I mean do you like this as things because there are people who don't like the system wants to send to distinction but are you one who likes it or just like\nYeah I I I think it captures something about cognition and I would just add that the system to works not just because we can put on thinking caps and sit back and reflect and and Bob punter slowly\nBut also we have social institutions such as the fact that if we make a claim someone else can disagree with us that we have to defend its waterfront empirical claim were called on to do I get evidence to do experiments to consult data so that was the socially situations\nThat our system to a recruits in the first place and insist on applying that makes us to to affect us\nSo if I were to try to ask well what actually is this capacity for a reason\nIt's partly in our psychology\nWere coming to you from Kepler looks in Menlo Park California will take more questions from a live and lively and rational and lightning audio and enlightenment to win philosophy talk continue\n[noise]\nThe air around us can carry a cool breeze the smell of baking cookies or even the key to romance\nA century feature that women find the most attractive and which is the most important for them in terms of selecting a library and actually how immense\nNow uncovering the invisible secret to bear on this week's big picture science [noise]\nBig picture science heading your way in the next hour here on K O W where our programming\nIs supported in part by our span presenting the third weekend at San Francisco open studios information and complete schedule at art span dot O. R. G. featuring artists and dog patch but ... Bay View Bernal heights ... your belt but what park in this valley\nMm three [noise]\n[noise] I mean\nYou know when they see\nLot of um\nI'm a\nUh [noise]\nMm\nAnd let them\n[noise]\n\n\n\nActually get into our lives musical guests Tiffany often an Adam Sean I'm ... and this is philosophy talk program that questions ever accept\nYour intelligence I'm Ken Taylor were asking whether reason can save us with Steve Pinker Harvard University\nEven want to go back to the question okay even perfectly rational individual noises rationally going about it and it doesn't necessarily add up to a rational collective decision I think this is one of the problems with the twenty first century so what do you think\nYou know we we obviously can't optimize uh everything I everyone's preferences our or even any criteria by which everyone's preferences can be simultaneously optimize the other hand you can't dispute whether or not rationality and progress knowledge\nIt's possible of course it's possible we vote limited smallpox we sent someone to the moon we invented the Internet and the smartphone and explain something has\nTo prove things anybody that hasn't optimize\nThat's right but still take a problem like global warming which is a collective action problem right which I Can't just come up I suppose I could have the killer technology that's out there but that's you know if the tipping point gets too long ago to make people adopt and use that technology and all this stuff\nLike that we've got these collective action problems and the difference between now and before is that we have impact on a global scale but we don't really have global institutions or at least not adequate global institution that toward NATO's off so I don't know I think we could be headed for like deep disaster even if we're all a individually for\nLike an ad that just to try to make it worse [laughter] I mean I I'm a big fan of reason as you are\nBut I have a worry in this particular ... um that you know the worry would be well you know you know all the other case you're talking about there isn't really a tension\nBetween um the kind of progress that comes out of these indictments Dyson institution but here it seems as though the program depend\nUpon technological advancement that is causing climate and so here it seems like we have a ... is a real problem for the ... we can't just say well let's let's sort of sick enlightenment values on that's sick progress on this program is a very thing that's been causing the problem and if it was\nWell I Know because if it's causing the potential for disaster that that's not progress I mean I think we could we would all agree well but the thing about a recent as it can always step back in ... and ... the problem is that the application of recent in the past has caused so far\nAnd so we can I indeed frame the technological question as given that we have improved our physical standards of living so far the costs of environment\nHow do we change that fade off than we can enjoy the same benefits energy capture of moving people around eating home schooling homes making cement without a releasing massive amounts of ... like I said that you tell us about that that ... what was the thing is I'm not making a\n... will succeed I'm challenging the idea that there's some inherent reason that we can yeah but I don't think your and then going back to the collective active right um ah once again I'm not but they make a prediction that that that I Know that we're going to solve it maybe ... maybe that will be disaster\nBecause we know their collective action problems I have to solve on a global scale through global institutions again there's no I'm not guaranteeing the school day but there is a pathway\nBy which everyone agrees to a sacrifice to turn equally like I like the ... let's get some more or less the rudest there there's not a guarantee that will take it just there's no in principle reason that we can't\nAgree about that one of them to love you Dr ...\nHighly I'm from Iran um I think if it's a little bit unfair to judge or reason with advances in technology you know technology is something that reason is kind of the foundation but uh you know\nHow does the reason major hockey or like sending man to the moon is it something valuable you know\nThere's two parts of one of them is that there can be things that make us better off but don't necessarily make us happier\nBut in general the answer is we we have gotten ... on average\nA majority of countries to which we have data over the decades on levels of happiness shows that it is a majority of those countries happiness has increased United States by the way it's not one of them [laughter] yeah but I'm a joy eighty eighty seven percent of countries for which we do have data show that to happen is that you have a\nYeah I really think about this question is um Horatio freezing her ready for science rent for progress but you know what about in China\nRight so this is something I think a lot about my work about that you know as the the reach of science expands so the the space for ... diminishes\nAnd your book in ... shows up such things like ... which is in ... but I think it's also like Sprite the new some fairy godmother isn't you know and love art and\nThings like that and so I I Want us to kind of rephrase that happiness question this way you know isn't doesn't happiness also depend on ... and where's the where's the it was a French I'm just going to\nShrink and drink and drink until he's intended by science\nAnd then I didn't know what I mean granted by by love and by art the strikes and ferries you can keep up that\nTravel [laughter] they were metaphorical\nYeah this is I I deal with this and what you know like right now because I Know there is I Know there's the view that well we've eliminated famine and we've doubled human life spans and leave a reduced child mortality by a factor of a hundred and we've eliminated war for most of the planet but yeah I saw\nOne in order to know about that [laughter] you know about a hit on a\nTreadmill you know you get more and more stuff and you say it will be settled there is I mean that's part of it even though he didn't like what is the point what is the purpose what is my life for what do I give my life over\nToo well you know I really don't think that eliminating disease and starvation and poverty and war is is all that boring and meeting [laughter] but even if you don't a segment war true and it turns out he said no it's not true that the studies show that people are not happier after winning the lottery that that turns out to be wrong people really are happy you\nKnow not hundreds [laughter]\nEven if that were true living to uh the age of eight is better than living to certain okay that's a that's a good question I but I I Do agree that we need to have a more heroic narrative of the fact that we are a limited in child mortality and we are reducing war\nHow you can restore the sense of\nPurpose and nobility in here with him and excitement to things like world peace and I said cheating the United nations sustainable development goals and maybe that doesn't get the blood [laughter] I could if properly advanced in Queens\nOkay so Steve I'm going to do something that we do from time to time here on philosophy talk going to make use our of rationality [laughter] at least ... hours and you get to change what ever institutions whatever laws whatever practices educational whatever you like nobody can ...", "year":
