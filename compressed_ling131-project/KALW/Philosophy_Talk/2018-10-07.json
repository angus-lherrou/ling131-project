that\nYou've been doing ... today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice well the U.S\nLed to read it and as a long and sorry history when it comes to racial injustice that also has

question for this week well\nPhiladelphia's John ... the big I mean just think about how many times we had to witness the tragedy of unarmed black men and boys little boys\nGetting shot and killed

those facts can but\nDo you have a point yes I Do have a point eliminate white privilege and with the unequal treatment of whites and people of color and racial injustice just goes away white privilege is racial injustice well I mean I'm just not convinced that the rampant mistreatment of blacks is\nAn instance of or even proof of the existence of what you're calling white prove will come again well okay we're philosophers let's start from the beginning of what exactly do you mean by white privilege timing is\nThe fact that white enjoy so many other advantages relative to others not just in the criminal justice system but in just about any fear of life you can name John So you think the fact of\nWhites are much more likely to be treated with respect by cops is a sign of honor and white privilege well\nWhat did they do to deserve that privilege except be born in\nYou know racist society yeah I Do know they were born doesn't everybody black white brown anything in between deserve to be treated with respect\nAll anyone ever has to do to deserve respect so it's not a privilege\nWhat are you trying to say I'm not sure what you're trying to say that\nYou're misconstrue in two different things related but different violations of black rights and protection of white privilege and I I don't get it look I grant you that cops too often trample the rights of black people\nThat's not to say that they don't trample the rights of white sometimes to or that they often treat everybody just as they should be treated\nBut violations of black rights are routine and are done with far a ... with impunity uh and and when whites are mistreated they're usually isn't doing very well you're just pulling my point though I'm refuting your point the problem isn't it the cops are wrong to respect the rights of whites\nThe point is that are wrong to disrespect the rights of black\n... wait a minute are you denying that there's such a thing as white privilege\nNo not at all but I'm saying that having your rights are respected is not an example of white ... book can you want or eliminate racial injustice\nDon't focus on white privilege right closing the country clubs or a a won't help much focus on securing the too often trampled rights of people of color\nPerks are belonging to the country club but but a A R up white supremacy there's a lot more serious I got just a fact of whites are\nBut deeply more deeply into them they're important distinctions but right now I'm going to remind our audience you're listening to philosophy talk and today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice\nIs eliminating white privilege to key to achieving racial justice or is it really a matter of securing the rights of black\nDoesn't really matter whether we use the language a privilege or the language of rights to describe our racial situation can't we just try to fix it and forget about Samantha debates privileged who writes injustice plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues\nYou can get our monthly e newsletter by taxing the word philosophy to to do eight to eight to stay current upcoming episode content [noise] other philosophy talk

to say if you why do we are I gave you lose brown ... stink Saddam when as you\nIt by a ... a\nReally a privilege to be white and All right or is there a deeper wrong to write I John Perry this is philosophy talked to a program that questions everything\nIncluding your poetry but not your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is the key to achieving racial justice eliminating white privilege or is it advancing black rights or to those amounted to the same thing\nOur guest is Naomi ... from the University of Oregon a author of the uh white privilege and black rights so now I mean\nI think we can all agree on the existence of a certain phenomena and\nHe's got various dimensions black people are often treated with less respect than white people and many contacts have less ... less access on average to the good things of life and all that everybody can agree about that phenomenon\nBut practically speaking I Wonder why doesn't matter whether we describe this phenomenon in terms of white privilege or black right\nBecause there's been an erosion due to a couple or or more a U.S Supreme Court rulings of um constitutional rights so the Fourth Amendment is supposed to give us all a protection against unreasonable search and seizure\nAnd the fourteenth amendment or it's supposed to give everyone equal protection under the law\nNow these amendments are seem to have been violated in these recent high profile cases and uh uh the violators the killers are are not punish you know there are they not indicted or else they're not convicted for the you know what\nYou're saying that if we I mean okay ... that's all sounds right to me but are you saying you legal yeah you're right it sounds like you're suggesting and I'm just trying to make clear whether you are not\nYou sound like you're suggesting if we adopt this discourse of white privilege instead of the discourse of of of of violations of black right we're going to be blind to exactly what's wrong what's gone wrong in a situation\nThat's right you know the problem with it ... it was white privilege is not the reality is that why you're better off I mean that is a problem but that's not what I'm disputing I'm just saying the discourse of white privilege especially when white people engage in this discourse\nIs kind of ... you know what it's like it's like it's like food he's talking about how wonderful their meal is in response to hearing about world hunger\n[laughter] well so you're saying\nGee that sounds that sounds like a pretty darn ing can I say the word damning uh in in the indictment of it just goes to fight for it and it also sounds like you think it is mostly white people you think ooh engaging the discourse of of of\nOf of white privilege and and but I Know some are more\n... it may not be for self serving reason it just may be oblivious a oblivious reasons oblivion um I ... I think one has to at this point to be a little delicate in in distinguishing who's saying\nWhat a about what and it's very different of black people talk about the how to better off and talk about white privilege\nThen if white people in answer to a stark injustices start talking about how privileged they are and we're hearing a lot of that from otherwise well meaning white people that's what I'm trying to ... ah make a little intervention or concerning\n... Sunday on me philosophically speaking from Plato's republics overalls theory of justice philosophers who think about justice tend to go off to thinking about an ideal society now I guess in an ideal society we certainly wouldn't be trampling the rights of blocks\nBut we also wouldn't have at least undeserved privileges for individual rights and know privileges for for people because of their race but it is focusing on ideal society an ideal justice leading us to kind of\nBush to problems one of which is much more grave and serious than the other together [noise]\nYeah I mean you are self centered if we had an ideally just society we wouldn't have these discrepancies but we don't and if you actually look at real history not the history of philosophy but real history [noise] people don't care about justice what they care about is injustice\nSo you see that today you know the black lives matter movement ... didn't come out of a philosophy clubs wanting to perfect the chandelier of ideal justice hanging from the ceiling of the universe [laughter] I'm In that case\nTo to have blood on the street\nYou say you have quite a way with were to have to tell you that I Love your way with with what I'm going to ask you a question I Want to ask you a question though about what I mean I owe a ... we'll get back to the ideal versus a you know non ideal justice but I Want to I Want to focus on white people just for a little bit\nBecause there are lots of white people who will ah I don't like to generalize but there are lots of white people who will acknowledge white privilege and they they take it to be a sign of their bona fides\nAs an ally to marginalize people that they are willing to acknowledge their white privilege there are others who will deny vehemently deny a white privilege they will they will turn to their own individual for a Jew an effort and blah blah blah so I mean it's a complicated thing and how I Wonder\nWhether the you think that those who deny white privilege or those who who are willing to acknowledge white privilege or in any way morally different or the birds of a feather or the two sides of the same point or what\nWas political um it's political and I ... in several different levels I mean there are a number of whites who are pretty upset about issues of social injustice\nAnd they'll do more than just acknowledged it their privilege they may actually do some research of support some clauses that lead to legal reforms um and then there are whites who are sort of appalled who are constable who like to think of themselves as nice people\nAnd they suddenly become aware that their privileged because they're white and their response to social injustice\nIs to talk about how nice their privileges are\nAnd I think that's useless I think that energy could be much better directed and then in political terms\nAre there are a number of whites who are under educated or who believe that all the ills that befall minorities are their own fault and therefore they are in contrast or as hard working white people deserve all the good things that happened to them and they have no\nThe end to Wiley [laughter]\nAligning with not and that that's actually catch my eye and not on this plan our genes I\nFelt like that so I\nCan't stand down\n\nBeyond say in a song called formation what she's saying at the super bowl according to Saturday Night live white people all over America were shocked to find out that beyond say was black or any rate a person of color some people thought the performance was too focused on race and identity politics\nWith white singer have the privilege of avoiding that kind of criticism I John Perry this is philosophy talk program that questions everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor I guess it ... from the University of Oregon and we're thinking about white privilege and black rights\nSo Naomi or we want to get a a little bit a practical here but let me give you a kind of a a different example in the ... we've been using if I I I'm kind of old and my started leaving us let's say if it ever existed is long in the past\nIf I Try to go to a hot club I'll be turned down a but by the guy at the door I feel bad about died I'll think young people have all these privileges they can they can read stuff and nine point fonts they can go to good clubs but then if I beat up by the\nPolice for complaining or I Would feel much more serious problem was there you know my rights had been violated whereas in the earlier case may be just there was kind of an unfairness involved a little less serious [noise] now\nHow should philosophers ah think about these things or\nIf we're not going to just do this kind of let's figure out the ideal society but let's figure out the basis for the difference this for the distinctions we made for things that are outrageous violations of justice and things that are just kind of sad facts about our society how should we get started doing that\nWell I think there is a priority for a agree just violations of justice if you're if you're talking if you're looking at the whole social political picture on the other hand if you're if you're a specialist in social philosophy and media studies or\nYou might not care that much and that's fine that's just not what you're working on but if you're looking at the society if you're looking at what's happening in contemporary times I think we have certain things that need to come first\nSo as as a practical example a lot of people think about how how should we think how do you think of affirmative action or in this context of privilege versus violation of rights\nSome people would think of affirmative action as breaking down barriers\nTo be admitted to there's not that the people people's rights are being violated but certain structures of privilege of being broken down [noise]\n[noise] yeah affirmative action is just ...\nIn that case I think that one one of the results of white advantage you could call white privileges that if people are in a position of power they're going to use it for people they know so if you can uh\nUh admit uh students or or hire a other faculty you're going to go to to people like you to children and friends to two people you already know and if you're white it's likely be on the white people\nAction and that's called cronyism\nNow affirmative action is a way of of a breaking into that and and creating more opportunities it's not\nIt's not just creating opportunities for people of color or for women it's it's creating opportunities in the structure it's it ain't going into that structure of cronyism which is lined up with white privilege\nSo that sounds like so you think there it sounds ... is that improving justice is if you cronyism as anti justice a ton of distributing I mean this is a kind of distribution of thing for him and he is in right who distribute this club memberships to it's kind of ... that sounds on us so it sounds like\n... even though you think a kind of justice is better served by the language of the pursuit of a kind of justice is better served by adopting the language of rights and protecting the right this is a sphere of justice in which\nA breaking down systems of privilege breaking down these distribution of systems is also a part of justice is is that right yes\nYeah there are different different forms of justice is immediate justice you do not want the police to be able to come up to you or your children and shoot them on site that's extremely unjust I mean that's an emergency or\nA situation of injustice but you know there are wider a structural forms of social justice you what you want if we if we have a democracy where to continue to work on having a democracy\nYou want everybody to have a a reasonable opportunity for the good luck than one of the ways that that can happen\nIs to break into systems that are closed because of tradition or because of racial hierarchy and affirmative action is a way of doing that\nOkay that's that's good Charles from Montclair is on the line welcome to philosophies on Charles\n[laughter] yes I have a different take on this and I think it's more of a matter of cloth that if you are but we can America or part of the ... ... ... ...\nYou get to differently than if you're a poor white or black coal pull anything\nYou put in the middle class and to give you an ... a former President George W book brought into Harvard Business school the coal you'll see difficult to get into the power of the people who the student that you know you could I Do this or do you do the\nSame thing you can tell you\nI I might have been able to earn a senior at Yale us bell I could've coop [laughter] I don't need to do that in both\nBut that was a long time ago it would be pretty hard to replicate George Bush's success don't advise young people coming up to rely on family connections to get them into Yale or however it doesn't work well\nLet me give you a different ... Kendall betray us you know he was caught ending as Mr ... okay until you paid for hundreds of thousands of fine\n... family whereas the whistle blower ... was put to sleep for the rest of the life by a foreign government\nNow is that going to do with\nA thanks for the government uh Charles I'm going to turn this over and ask a Naomi what she thinks\nWell I think class of ... so far and then you run into is just the status of for example Henry Louis Gates was I'm African American a professor at Harvard\nOr have had that incident a few years ago where he was stopped after returning trying to get into his own house who's got into an altercation with police was arrested [noise] um [noise]\nA President Obama has been treated with incredible disrespect or which after a while one can only conclude has a racial component it it it's not it's not class so yeah sure class\nAnd and you know classes not um [noise] one miner less a matter of income I mean it has to culture and has to do is um networks of social capital education\nClass and money ap classes important but it's not the whole story because um there have been studies on every level of class whites are better off than black on every socioeconomic yeah\nI Want to take you back to the distinction you made at the top but I I like but I Want to target it a little more uh you'd you distinguish white privilege or\nAs a system of perks from white supremacy as an ideology and all that and uh I get your distinction I think it's an important distinction are but I Want to push you a little bit because I was recently reading some stuff with Cornel West and the diagnosis the problem with a\nPresident Obama by saying President Obama refuses to address the fact\nHe's too afraid to address the fact that the U.S is still a white supremacist a society it's not legally so I mean the laws and at the same but the root problem\nIn the U.S is is white supremacy and used to you if you look at a critically he things you see it everywhere no one can Cornel West is I assume you Cornel West is wrong what do you think he's real ... I like your distinction but tell me why you're right and he's real", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "07"}
