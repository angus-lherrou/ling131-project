San Francisco\nWe continue conversations that began at philosophers corner on the Stanford campus\nThat for ... teaches philosophy and I did for forty here\nToday it's a special edition of last year we were looking beyond the horse race asking some of the philosophical questions raised by this year's presidential election\nTrump and Clinton dominate the headlines in part because the Republican and Democratic Party's dominate our government which leaves a lot of people wishing they had more viable third party options so why do we have the two party system we do we'll talk with rolling Kmart from the Brookings Institution\nIn a democracy you do end up with something that a lot of people don't like because you have to make a compromise\nSome of the dissatisfaction was a major party nominees also stems from the influence of money on every aspect of the campaign and politics in general\nWill examine the role of money in politics with former secretary of labor\nRobert rush if we're free and equal citizens we actually should have an equal opportunity to influence political debate [noise]\nNow what if you're so dissatisfied with the candidate that you wonder if you should vote at all\nWill you be in good company the U.S has some of the lowest voter participation in the world\nWill be joined in just a bit but Stanford political scientist Emily Chapman will ask or whether voting is a choice or duty\nFirst we set our roving philosophical reporter sugar calling card\nTo put that question to potential voters she filed this report\nCombat\n\nRed Bull [noise]\nKing junior

felt like where I think they\nI don't really voting is going to have it it's going to be here\nI feel like if it would be more for my own sort of the nation and feeling like I was a way it probably will not get as\nMany argue there's no point in voting because we have a two party system that limits chances if any true democracy in\nOur founding father George Washington\nThought all political parties or something\nIn his farewell attractive Seventeen Ninety six he wrote\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened wooden spirited prevent natural to party dissension is itself a frightful despotism and then there's money\nThere's a lot of it in politics according to open secrets three months before the twenty sixteen presidential elections Hillary Clinton had received over four hundred and thirty million dollars in campaign contributions over half of them from the corporations\nAre two party money loving political system is not [noise]\nTo improve our elections and improve our participation\nSo uh the first thing I Would do would be to make a election day a national holiday uh I think that not only lower some of the barriers for participation but it also gives people a more positive reason to vote because it's sort of suggests a this sort of public element of celebration around us\nReally a private that you do a ... just like filling out any other kind of farm\nOkay that's the first thing you do you is there more you're going to be three things\nYeah so a voter registration making voter registration automatic and having a a consistent and and uh up to date and efficient method for\nSeeing who was on the voter rolls I think would be very important and that would be absolutely necessary for following through with the third thing I Would do which would be to make a voting compulsory\nWith systems similar to Australia's twenty dollar fine yeah OK well Australian dollars are American American dollars so it takes a lot of really this is better I'm going to vote but I always felt and I hope some of our listeners out there\nWho might be sitting on the fence will be convinced to vote for somebody or something thanks very much I Hope so too [noise]\nEmily Chapman from Stanford University at her thoughts on the duty to vote you're listening to Boston because today we're taking a philosophical workers at twenty sixteen election corporate\nCampaign spending independent superPACs self funded billionaire candidates how did it get so expensive to run for office Ken our democracy survive the amount of money in our elections\nWill ask former secretary of labor Robert Reich money politics and the future of democracy when philosophy talk continues\nMhm [noise]\nMhm [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to philosophy talk it's our twenty six the\nSpecial I'm John Kerry and I'm Ken Taylor\nWe're taking a philosophical look at some of the big ideas raised by this year's presidential campaign\nUp next sure effects are a lot of money to run for office these days I don't need anybody's money\nI'm using my own money I'm not using the lobby is I'm not using donors I don't care who I'm really rich in\nLaws are known about money in politics [noise]\nWhy are these people are putting huge amounts of money into\nOur political system\nYou got something to say that\nBut you will not find that I ever change debut boring\nBecause any donations that I ever see\nThrowing money at it because they have total control\nSingle thing she does\nWe're joined now by Robert rice he was the lead\nProfessor of public policy at the University of California Berkeley He's the author of saving capitalism for the many not the few\nBob welcome to philosophy die\nA thank you very much Ken ...\nI Know you feel strongly about this topic that we want to talk to you about the influence of money in politics and I'm particularly concerned with the question of whether all this money in politics is really consistent with a thriving democracy I what I fear that it is not I I Wonder what you think\nIt definitely is not a and this is not a new issue uh years ago a really at the tail end of the first gilded age\nWhen economic power was concentrated and wealth is concentrated in a very few hands or the eminent jurists Louis Brandeis a said and I can only paraphrase him a we have a choice we can either have great wealth in the hands of the very few people or we can have a democracy we cannot have both\nSo let's distinguish a economic equality and inequality from political equality and inequality I mean\nI I Would think that democracy as part of its foundational thing\nIs committed to equal access to the means of political participation independently of well that's the principle of democracy equality of income that's a good thing but I don't know if that's a fun foundational some degree of equality of income equality of opportunity is foundational democracy but\nCan't you kind of at least conceptually can't you have\nAn equal access to the means of political participation through regulations of various kind without necessarily solving the distribution no problem about how should we distribute well\nWell theoretically you cat and the Supreme Court though in a series of decisions\nHas decided that number one money is the equivalent of speech\nNow that was in a case called Buckley against ... once you decide that money is the equivalent of speech and you have a free speech First Amendment part of the constitution then that almost by definition gives people with a lot of money\nAnd again we're not talking about just garden variety of inequality here we're talking about white inequality we're talking or you give people with a lot of money a special access it's no longer equal access to the means of political participation\nAnd then secondly the Supreme Court in Citizens United against the ... the federal election commission\nDecides that corporations are people under the first amendment\nSo put those two concepts together money is speech corporations are people out of the first amendment and it's no longer equal access to the media would have been participation\n... let me uh John roles are whom I admire her this what he called the difference principle to account for the inequality said it's OK for people to have more than others as long as they're having more contributes to the overall uh goodness of life for everyone\nSomething like that to the least well ah you know to the least\nWell off so I I Would I Would modify roles in terms of realism and say okay they're going to have twice as much as they need to contribute to the last well off has America ever come close to the different principle um\nWell it's interesting a rolls also get along with that difference principle positive veil of ignorance so that's in coming up with what we might think of as the best set of rules and the most\nA perfect system with regard to distribution of income uh we would just say well we don't know where it will come out uh we we have available ignorance over\nHow we would do under those rules but they appear to be fair to us not withstanding\nThat are of what would be good for the system as a whole so that in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as we move toward a more much more egalitarian society than we had before\nI think we came close to the rosy indifference principal or the veil of ignorance principle hot starting in the late Nineteen seventies early Nineteen eighties I think we diverge from that most people\nWhen asked for example in a variety of polls not just a single but actually this has been repeated over and over again what do you think the current distribution of wealth is in the United states and what should it be\nA they come up with a you know a fairly consistent ideas but then when they're shown what it actually is almost everybody is surprised because what it actually is is so much more concentrated than what they believe it is or what they think it should be\nI Gotcha and that's kind of depressing but since I'm a philosopher it I'm a little pernicious I mean the money is speech idea\nI get why some people especially when it's a political ridge I get why some people are question that but\nThis seems kind of reasonable thought there look if I Want to advocate for something\nMe Ken Taylor I Want to advocate for something I don't want an advocate for it on the ... on the public airwaves and all that sort of stuff and I by the time to advocate for it and the government were to come along and say no you can't do that can you can spend your money to advocate for I don't know\nUh the end of the prison industrial complex I'd say government where do you get off restrict telling me how much I can spend of my own hard earned money or to advocate for things that I Believe in isn't as a democracy so I mean is it an odd thought that money is speech\nI Know it's not an odd thought at all and you put your finger exactly on the Supreme Court's logic ... the problem is that when you have as much concentration of income and wealth as we now have\nWell I think there are few justices that or why is there are few centers are wise but mostly I'd say are attempting to get some philosopher kings and there hasn't been too well either\nYou're listening to philosophy dog it's our two thousand sixteen election special\nKen here's a rental for you what are these three people have in common Jill Stein Gary Johnson and Darryl castle\nJohnson and started running for president I don't know the other one\nHe's running for president to\nThese are just three of the so called third party candidates\nBoth wiring third parties represented elsewhere in our government what explains the overwhelming dominance of the two major parties in American politics\nQuestioning our two party system when philosophy talked to a continuous [noise]\nWelcome back it's our twenty sixteen election special I'm John Kerry this is for us we talk on the program that question everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm ... we're looking through a philosophical ends at some of the big issue and the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign right now a closer look at our two party system [noise]\nThe Republican I Want to run as the Republican nomination\nIs there anyone\nOn stage is unwilling tonight to pledge here support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and its latch to not run an independent campaign\nParty presumptive nominee jumped on said that the Democratic party elites have been\nHanded sabotaging a grassroots campaign that tried to bring some huge numbers of young people independent non voters into their party instead they've shown exactly why America needs a new major party\nYour\nStand your conscience for free [noise]\nWe're joined now by laying Kmart she's a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution she's author of primary politics everything you need to know about how America nominates presidential candidate Elaine welcome to below the dog well thank you for having me\nLane you written in thought a lot about the two party system\nUm I don't think it's good or bad\nBecause the way I party system evolves is a reflection of the underlying way a country chooses to organize this democracy I think it's neutral just as I think a multi party system is also neutral they each have their upsides and there are downsides\nAnd the fact is they come out of the structure of the Democratic system that a country or state chooses to use for itself\nSo but wait a minute let's go down a little bit of it comes out on the structure of assisted another country uses words though to use ... or ... which is our design for democracy right it was mentioned parties anywhere in a minute and then about not only did our founding fathers are a part of it would be the death of democracy and all that so\nWhat are the ... well what I'm Talking about is our constitution established a house of representatives and we establish single member districts and any country as other countries have that have single member districts\nIt means that you will lead to one person from the district if you'll elect one person from the district it is very hard to divide that person individual into four or five different parties down the vote that would be cruel and unusual punishment yes most certainly would and not to mention very confusing\nSo let's look up to today there are a lot of people not just a few a lot of people who express a deep dissatisfaction with the two party system they expressed deep resentment that they've got this limited choice\nAnd that they want a third part they they're hungry for a third party it sounds to me like you're saying you're methods to those people are not not to put too fine a point of it and it is to get over it [laughter] I mean\nWell let me put it this way there is nothing that keeps any American from forming a political party there are there has\nBeen third parties in American history but again going back to the structure of the system if you have a winner take all districts\nIt means that it is very hard for a third party to get traction because getting twenty or twenty five percent of the vote just doesn't do anything for you whereas in a multi\nParty system or a multi a candidate district you get twenty five percent of the vote and you win twenty five percent of the seats in the parliament\nI'm In those countries a small party can grow it can get some power in one election do a good job in office maybe become part of the majority governing coalition and grow into the next election right in our system in or in any one one pass the poster stump\nIt's really hard for a third party to get traction\nThat's why mostly what happens to third parties and American democracy is that they get they've gotten incorporated into one of the two major parties\nSo so when I was a growing up uh France was really in disarray they couldn't get anything done and we were told books because they had so many different political parties nobody really hilly power than the goal took over and they did\nDid better but now in America we seem to have just two parties but also nothing gets done Congress can't do anything or do we managed to have the best the worst of both worlds [laughter] we're\nIn a period of our history where not just the parties about the voters are highly polarized and the parties are simply reflecting the what the voters are telling them we we are in a very highly polarized time and at some point\nThe polarized times in our republic before maybe the most dramatic being of course the party system prior to the civil war where they never could resolve things and they actually went to work for\nUm we were also highly polarized at the end of the nineteenth century so we've been through a lot of periods of polarization in American politics and they usually end by one party\nActually capturing a working majority and that is strong enough to a get some things done and be caused an end to the polarization\nBut no one of the consequences of what you're talking about oh no let's think about the nature of these two parties in a in a in a first pass opposed the single representative system versus a\nMulti party system was proportional representation those parties are going to be it seems to me 'cause it's a big complicated country yep those parties are gonna seemed to me highly kind of coalition Owen somewhat ideologically ducked fuse right\nNow yeah ... absolutely I mean they have to be they are they are the proverbial big tent\nUm for many years southern Democrats were very different from northern Democrats and New England Republicans were\nLiberal and very different from western Republicans\nUm yeah if they've always been big tent eight but they are also always evolving in other words there's nothing static about American political parties they've always changed um and you know the party of Lincoln\nAh the Eighteenth sixty Republican Party that was that declared the Emancipation Proclamation\nA lot of people at the Republican convention were wondering what happened to the party of Lincoln okay so there are always changing\nBut but I still want to go back to the current dissatisfaction with the two parties\nI mean the Tea Party found the Republican Party of then constituted highly unsatisfactory the Sadrists people find the Democratic party highly unsatisfied many people call themselves independent though they still vote for one party or the other more or less\nConsider family I mean it sounds like a ... so you got these two parties are highly ... coalition oh but there's bound to be decided to function with them because of that\nBut it also sounds like your message to these folks who are highly dissatisfied is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San
