Democrats and Republicans vowed to use the anger the hearings generated to motivate their supporters\nAccording to ... ... there's a pretty good chance that could work but it might do a lot of damage in the process Marcia is a political scientist at Stanford University earlier this year she co wrote a study which found that partisanship is becomes so entrenched in American political life\nThat voters are more likely to cast a ballot against someone may have been in favor of someone they like Marcia ... good morning walk on the day six\nHappened to be here morning is there anyone left in the United states who's getting ready to cast a vote in favor of someone they like rather than against someone may hate\nOh wow I that's a great question I think there are certainly people ah who do believe are very much in their party politics but it does seem as though the majority of people are really being driven by this part of negativity this dislike of the opposing party\nIt's almost like hate boating and and your research has shown that there's a rising tide of a boat but how do you measure people's negative feelings about a candidate\nYeah there is something called a feeling thermometer such a fairly well known to all that we ask people on a survey\nFrom zero to one hundred how do you feel about a candidate or a person or group you know with zero being very negative and one hundred being very positive fifty being andme at points to fifty would be you know I have no feelings with this person whatsoever I'm pretty neutral yeah okay\nAnd what did the viewing thermometers say about Clinton and Trump twenty sixteen\nSo it's really interesting is that the most popular response for people of the opposing party was zero and this isn't even asking about Clinton and Trump this is asking you know if you're a Democrat how do you feel about Republican or you know if you are a Republican how do you feel about Democrats the the most popular answer with zero which is pretty astounding did it used to be higher\nI don't really read simply actually the most popular answer was a\nForty so that was you know sort of mild dislike but it's really shifted over the course of the past decade or two\nDown to zero is a pretty precipitous drop [noise] so what what has happened and what can you tell us when it got so low or what precipitated that\nThey've actually been a pretty well known are well documented trend since the Nineteen eighties aware apart assistants have expressed more disliking more negativity towards the opposing party but it's really accelerated in the past two decades mhm in the two thousand\nBut what about the last election that was a division of time in American politics would change things quite dramatically did\nFour zero it didn't seem to accelerate it it was very similar to the results that we were getting in twenty twelve so it seems as though the reason that the contest was so ... was that part is since tend to really dislike the opposition as opposed to the other way round\nSo now we have all of this anger in politics what do you think its effect is on on democracy has changed politics [noise]\nThere is a big broader concern right about what happens when people are motivated to participate by their hatred and distrust the opposing party or there is this concern of accountability when we have politicians uh you know who supported driven by how negative they are about the opposing party\nWe end up in a system where politicians aren't really trying to propose policies that help their constituents but rather sort of competing for how to bash the opposing party the most\nSo once a politician has written anger to office there's no incentive to broaden their appeal\nYeah in fact the incentive is to just continue to push on this anger and this negativity which in turn creates this sort of self reinforcing cycle where you know politicians that she had a party that million voters more negative and so the voters are more sort of pushing on politician to bash the other party\nAnd it would certainly demand that a certain kind of politician someone who does feel empowered by being hateful would would put themselves forward but what happens if if someone decides to turn the tide of a single positive candidate comes forward do you think that that aberration could reverse the trend\nI mean I Wish I could say that it did but I think there's been a number of attempts right not only at sort of curbing this a tide of negativity but it also\nMay be exploring maybe third party options are moderate options and those haven't really seemed to work out partisanship is a really powerful social identity and people are very much drawn to their tribe\nWhy do you think this was happening now what what's going on in people's lives that make the other side so completely disposable to be hated\nPartisans tends to interact more than ever with\nPeople of their same party so we know for example that inter marriage rates between people over the opposing parties are down we know that there have been some studies on online dating where they a show that people are really not likely to date people have the opposing party\nAnd we also know that in social media people tend to self segregate into sort of groups these sort of echo chambers\nSo in the end all of this sort of results in a very sort of fractured society where Democrats really talking interact with Democrats and Republicans really talk and interact with Republicans\nDo you think the whole idea of why ability as a quality candidate should pull out of it is done\nSo I think that sort of personal traits likeability sort of integrity really matter is when it comes to things like turn outrage so we saw in the twenty sixteen election that democratic turnout in a lot of places that Hillary Clinton really needed to win seem to be lower than a in twenty twelve for Obama\nYou know the real place where these qualities matter is not from turning people who would vote for a Democrat into people who would vote for Republican or vice versa\nBut instead and turning people who would you know maybe stay home because they feel odd satisfied with their choices to actually get them to go out and vote\nThan if you ever going to have been making about brings it in the u._k. and Trump and the U.S and the rise of extremist parties in Western Europe which is that you know if you want you can just call the people who are voting for these movements all kinds of names racists access to hate balls you know for whatever you want in some cases that might be true\nBut the reality is that when a ruling class fundamentally fails to safeguard the interest of a huge portion of the population sooner or later they're going to realize that and they're going to be supportive of whoever is perceived to be on the outside of that system that they hate and threatening to burn it down and I think until we come to grips with that\nAnd start engaging in some self critique going to have a lot more breakfast Trump's in Boston ours in our future\nIt's widely believed that ball so narrow when tomorrow glenview expect the day to be peaceful or do you think there'll be turbulence\n[noise] I think the only way there would be turbulence and that there were a very unexpected result namely the workers' party winning there has been some slight shift toward their workers' party over the last week and it's not impossible but Boston are has already said an advanced that he would regard any\nResult other than him in and the by product of fraud and he urged the armed forces to take action against it so I Would only expect unrest in turbulence in the unlikely event that Boston are losing\nGlenn Greenwald thank you very much
