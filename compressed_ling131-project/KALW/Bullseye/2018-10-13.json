whether it's legal in Canada or not it's a bad idea\nAnd as you may have heard once or twice a day for months on October seventeenth marijuana will be legal right across the country just for more sweet spot for Robert rosy robot\nThe arrival of legal pot is bittersweet\nIn Canada Rosie is famous for his drug convictions were not being so most you know given the number of convictions in the late ... cents infamous is absolutely the better word or whether there's no money in the infamous so you know even after legalization there will be no money in in the\nRose you grew up in Belleville, Ontario and then the sixties and seventies he was part of the equally infamous ... college in Toronto it was a student run\nDiverse Rosie loves everything about it he was first introduced to drugs when he was Fifteen by the time you get to rush Dale drugs were part of his life and he wasn't just consuming he was supplying his first major conviction came in Nineteen Seventy seven\nWell let's see the first time was a ton of hash at the airport and I got fourteen years and appealed it down to nine the second a conviction was uh was sixteen thousand pounds of how she's five hundred pounds of oil and a bunch of ties\nBack then rosy had Neil Young and writer Norman Mailer stepping up to his defense they were still within eight years later when rosy received the sentence that made Canadian history\nIn Nineteen eighty five I was convicted of importation and conspiracy of traffic conspiracy import and I never has a sandwich are always conspiracy\nThe big net and um I was sentenced to Twenty years they ask for life and the judge said no I don't want to give them twenty of he was giving me a break\nIt was the longest sentence ever given in Canada for dealing so called soft drugs and it wasn't the end for Rosie\nI peeled back got a new trial and then I got Seventeen and then I got another uh an Eighteen consecutive for talking about buying some marijuana saw altogether I was sentenced\nTo sixty nine years for cannabis in Canada and all those sixty nine years how much did rosy surf Twenty years [noise] three or four months\n[noise] what are the reasons judges or top and rosy robot was because he was unrepentant even back then rosy thought pot should be legal\nI like uh\nI like the pot I'm really impressed with BC\nFrom a have not province in Iraq and now\nIt's reasonable to think what we date imminent Rosie would be celebrate but he's not for one thing some of the people who fought to put ... users dealers in jail are now part of the newly legalized industry\nJulian ... is the former commissioner of the Ontario provincial police he's also a former MP and a member of Stephen Harper his cabinet key along with former MP Gary good year\nOr on the board of a leafy a new medical cannabis provider and they aren't the only former police officers or politicians investing in the industry\nWhile the hypocrisy of the police officers and and the MPs being involved is just a just throws me off\nReally really throws me off because I don't understand\nThey I don't know how they can have the guts to say [laughter] talk to press the being\nStating that yeah we did that but that was that now we're [noise]\nWe're now we're doing a desk and uh and uh we're enjoying the work and we're going to make some money yes\nThat's what we're doing it for\nAnother thing that bugs Rosie is that he can't invest in the industry because of his past criminal convictions\nI'm not actually into the money part of it but why can I participate I have things to bring to the table and soda is a lot of other people which I Would bring along with me\nBecause I wouldn't want it to work [noise] I mean I have a thing in my head what I what I Would like to do they they when they came to people like me a year ago it would be in all done that it'd be all done ready to roll and and we will be able to cut out a lot of criminal Jenike stuff 'cause I Know that world too\nIt's not just that he's shut out of the industry the federal government has yet to make a decision about pardons an amnesty for people with previous pot convictions that means that in addition to not being able to invest\nBecause his convictions still show on his record\nI have I have three children\nIn in in United States I have seven grandchildren I have three great grandchildren they have to come up you see me I'm an undesirable\nSo for Rosie the arrival of legal pot doesn't do anything to settle the question what role he played in the story including serving time amongst murderers and sexual abusers\nWas a a a preserve the war on drugs you know current ah because I didn't see me as a criminal ...

things that make climate change and global security problem as well\nWe now know that the long drought in Syria that began in two thousand and eleven was one of the forces underlie the instability

maybe you should take your celebrities like you take your friends you know somebody's really well informed than maybe their opinion should matter but I think more importantly than that\nYou should be the one doing the research you shouldn't necessarily just be listening to what a celebrity says you shouldn't just be listening to what a politician says you should be seeking out the facts and really make decisions on your own [noise]\nMark Harvey is the graduate director at the University of St Mary in Kansas and he's the author of celebrity influence in\nWe have to take a short break coming up

not a dummy if you Miss USA word now and again which begs the question how many English words and phrases are we all screwing up all the time if you've ever said something you weren't definitively short was right well\nYou might want to hear from my next guest Ross and Kathy Patrick or the brother and sister duo behind the book that doesn't mean what you think it means\nA guy do a hundred and fifty of the most commonly misused words and phrases in the English language and they are with me now caffeine Rosh ... walking back today say\nGood morning hey coffee I snuck or is it sneak a couple of grammar Michigan instrument that preamble did you catch them\nWell and how could we not right begs the question\nThat many like grunting mighty how many times have\nYou have you looked up the Miss USA begs the question\nIt's funny that's one that I always had used wrong I thought begs the question meant you know raised the question which doesn't actually mean that it was it\nWhat what can we can you explain it to us it's hard actually\nIt's um a logic term and it means that you're trying to prove something based on a premise that needs to be proved itself right so it's it's it's ... it's faulty the reasoning behind it but people as an example of it we have in the book is\nFrench films are the best because they make films that are in France that begs the question because you're assuming something and then you're not supporting it\nRight so the assumption is that they make films better in France and we don't know why you think back so the question is how do you know that\nExactly right so it does not mean raises the question but that's how I Would say Ninety nine by nine percent of the time\nThat I saw you over here so Ross is there anything else in my introductory flunk me for you bet definitively right I was misused okay do one thing that interested\nThose you used Peru's which I I always used wrong we wrote the book okay I always assumed cruise meant kinda skim yes it does it mean to go ... and here comes a problem with language all the time\nIf I just said I Peru's your memo new I mean I looked at a casually or do I mean I thoroughly studied it right and this is what to some degree it's\nIt's not just ... to look at words and try to use them carefully laws have some real consequences right demeaning to be almost a ...\nPerfect human dictionaries yourselves or are there out we're\nGod no you you were off on a Ninety nine percent of the partners to get a big strong but what about you Ross weren't weren't trips you up\nUm besides per well this one I'm In my defense Obama used raw okay non plus I bought at one point during the elections that he was really pleased that his kids were non plus about everything a non plus means\nBut we'll dirt rise right frightened stop it you can't say anything more huh I previously sort of assumed that meant kind of like calm cool and collected yes and interestingly enough when Obama said non plus incorrectly a whole bunch of people came on line and so it isn't it wonderful to have a president who uses correct word\nRight [laughter] I don't think Casey did let the honestly I was a lot better than someone else [laughter] your coffee\nAnother word from the book that really got me was pristine can you use that one correctly for me was that\nWe went down I to be honest with you I did not know what it meant until I wrote that section and that was one that I had written because I thought Christine ... you know clean perfect like you go like this like pristine bathroom and you ... it it doesn't it technically means original it like in in its original state so you can have a pristine swamp that\nThat week sin is covered in like [noise]\nYou know write something because it's untouched it's like ... although this is an example of a word that has been used so often to me the way I thought that we as like\nYou know ... ... it does now mean appearance spotless I might only D says it's considered ignorant by educated speakers but I Will cop to being one of those ignorant speakers because I still use pristine to mean you know clean as everybody else does yeah and and\nUnlike the misuse of the word non plus which is the complete opposite of what the word is intended to mean in the case of ... gonna mistake what you're saying\nNo no I and I think that's a really interesting point that you've just written the real issue is Ross alluded to earlier alluded not eluded\n[laughter] is that we we it's it's good to use words to me and exactly what they mean to be able to communicate with no issue with communication if if you're not going to miss understood I think we can just cut everybody a little flat\nRight okay so here's former FBI Director James Comey he'd because he's one of the people that you have singled out for grammar mistakes and this is a clip of coal me speaking to the Senate Judiciary committee listen to this\nIt makes me mildly nauseous

in New York City so you're nauseous means causing Natasha what he should have said is it makes me nauseated\nThat means feeling sick to your stomach there's a distinction there but in New York you would actually say ... you would\nNot nearly as I said this is this\nHow did it for noxious work that I use it for me in a sense okay um\nI don't I I I I can go now and then his language doesn't make any reviewing speaking it is the\nProblem\nHere that the English language has so many rules and so many words that sound alike or similar enough that that I mean\nI got I got one I got one okay okay
