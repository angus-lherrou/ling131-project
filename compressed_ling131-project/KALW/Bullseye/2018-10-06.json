would you explain this rise in the public expression of women's anger over the last month and in particular this past week\nI think what we have here is very clear indication that women are fed up they're tired they're exhausted they're sick of being subjected to this kind of behavior vote that intimate levels but now very clearly an egregiously it's institutional level and so it's not so much that the rage\nIs I'm new to be honest but that it is being acknowledged by women themselves and external eyes in ways that are traditionally a police\nAnd is that what you mean in your subtitle when you talk about the power of women's anger\nYes I mean we didn't qualify that word because of course it can be a powerfully negative force if it's not understood if it's not acknowledge its meaning is not made out of this notion buck likewise it can be a hugely positive force and we need to acknowledge that\nAspect of anger we tend to denigrate anger and associate it with contempt unfair and discuss which we see in Trump's rallies all the time right but anger is also what is behind that compassion and empathy and dry for social justice that were simultaneously saying\nIn the hearings last

could hold him accountable in a public court and call into question\nUm his a status I think is what he was angry at and that kind of anger that he displayed and and the other men in that room

will follow that was Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week he was talking about his company's decision to raise the minimum wage of its employees in the U.S to Fifteen dollars an hour starting November the company also pledged to lobby the U. S. government for\nFederal minimum wage increase or Amazon has no plans to do the same and Canada though it says it's already paying wages around or above Fifteen\nDollars at most Canadian location Amazon's move with widely lauded by industry watchers and politicians among US Senator Bernie Sanders\nWho had raised the heat on Amazon last month with a bill to subtly titled the stop days act\nFor ... years old today has done is gone only enormously important for Amazon hundreds of thousands of employees it could well be will be shot heard around the world well\nThat being said not everyone is convinced the Amazon needs is to move out of the goodness of its heart this week the company came under fire\nAfter reports that it also plans to phase out employees mostly bonuses and the current stock option program Amazon says its workers total compensation was still increase but my next guest says the biggest winner in Amazon's minimum wage deal might be [noise]\nYou got Amazon itself Louise ... is a staff writer at wired Louise welcome\nToday sex thanks for having me so Jeff Bezos has framed Amazon as a leader for raising the company's minimum wage how much credit does he deserves for this [noise] so he's certainly not\nThe first major retailer to raise wages in recent years target is facing and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage as well that will fully go into effect by twenty twenty and Costco also recently raised its wage to fourteen dollars an hour they're not the first company to raise their minimum wages in recent years and it's kind of an surprising because there's so few people in the U.S\nAnd other places looking for jobs right now since the very tight labor market\nRight and also I mean there's been a lot of people organizing around the issue of raising the minimum minimum wage or looking at a Fifteen dollar minimum wages well correct\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we should really unpack kind of this Fifteen dollar number because it's not something that Amazon necessarily came to on its own it's a very symbolic numbers since twenty twelve fast food workers and other workers and the retail industry had been\nFighting for Fifteen and it's been this kind of grassroots movement across the country so I think they really chose that number very particularly because it has so much symbolic importance\nNow you also mentioned the timing um why do you think Amazon made the decision to announce the wage increase when it did right at the start of October\nSo there's both a historical reasons and a future is and I think the historical reason is that over the summer and the spring they faced a series of investigative reports that show that working conditions in their warehouses their driver\nUm reports about grueling practice is about you know not having enough break feeling like the work was really hard you know workplace accidents and those reports were coming both of us the u._k. and elsewhere that were workers striking\nI think that's part of the equation and and the other part of the equation is that in the next several months they need to hire you know over a hundred thousand seasonal workers to accommodate the holidays\nRight and and how competitive is that now to find workers to to work during the Christmas season it's really competitive\nThe um you know the unemployment rate here in the U.S just dipped below us four percent for the first time in years you know there's not a lot of people looking for jobs right now\nYeah and I and I think too I mean there's also the news that came I think it was just this week is well known that Jeff Bezos has just overtaken Bill Gates has the world's richest man so how\nMuch is this might also be good PR for Amazon to look like it's a it's a real leader for workers' rights\nI think there's a lot of it I mean I think Amazon kind of is much more public facing company that a lot of these other retail giants they employ less people than Wal Mart but there's still one of the largest employers in the country here in the U. S. and you'll be in play a lot of people in Canada as well\nBut unlike some of these other retailers Jeff Bezos is such a publicly known figure he's a household name Amazon is not only a retailer they're also you know a tech company either an online platform\nAnd I think being the richest person in the world is not doing them any favors and you know it's a very he's a very easy target I you know no one no one knows the CEO of Walmart is right that's not a household name but you know Jeff Bezos has\nYou know grace the covers of magazines you know people know who he is and his workers know who he is and they know how much money he has and I think that really plays into it\nYeah you you mentioned some of the concerns that had been raised about conditions for workers at Amazon soon addition to enhancing the increase to Fifteen dollars an hour did Amazon announced any other new policies to address the issues that workers had been complaining about\nThere was no update about working conditions which\nIs one of the things that organizers are talking about that they still think that they need a union or collective organizing in order to address these other issues right all of this is still in Amazon's control right now they get to choose how much they pay their workers you know while this is a good move and it's going to help them it's not necessarily evidence of the fact that they always listen to what workers want\nTo feel like the other thing that's hanging over this is the question of automation and we know that Amazon has already placing some warehouse workers with robotic systems so how does that that sort of you know increasing and looming threat figure into the company's equation yes I think what investors are\nThinking about right now is how are they going to pay for this pay increase and I promise you that Amazon would have not you know done this unless they really knew how they're going to pay for it and make sure that they know their bottom line is their priority and automation is definitely something they're thinking about the long term\nWant their warehouses have left off right they wanted to be an incredibly you're well oiled system that's mostly automated and I think there definitely thinking about that here you know in the future we're going to have less workers it takes a lot less money to ship goods through Amazon than it did only a couple of years ago because of advances in automation\nBanks who you're hurting my doctor to\nDoctor marry another era is the c._e._o. of a Venezuelan health observatory and a professor

forty years ago\nThey recorded many albums together played many concerts shot many TV episodes and accumulated many many many wars they became sharing and Bram after the death of lowest lineage dining twenty fifty Sharon and Bram announced their final farewell tour before hitting the road they agreed to come by the day six studio\nSharon hands inbred Morrison welcome today sex thank you very much\nI Know your debut album which was also your first Juno nomination one elephant does and I found that was forty years ago at sharing what were you thinking about it at the time did it feel like it was the beginning of a long journey no [laughter]\nIt felt like it was a moment in time we made an album we we decided to make an album together and we went back to singing individually after that we had no idea what they had\nNo ... no business plan or artistic plan no nothing plan just do it hey as Matt nice and continue on during what we were doing\nAnd hasn't felt that with like a different parts of your career did it always feel like you had planned to head or does it always feel like you were just living in the moment as you were going along\nWell it was a very large learning curve you know we had a lot to learn every step of the way because we hadn't done any of the things that lay ahead of us a lot of work and a lot of fun yeah\nWell you know as folk you use the folk music world is very casual kind of world which I like very very much but when you get into public performance it's a whole other thing and you got to learn the ropes yeah\nWell and also you you know some pioneers in the work that you were doing in that you were doing children's use it but also family music that you were actually kind of inventing the kind of music and the kinds of performances in a way\nWe always thought that our audience was not just children as you said it's families too because some people who perform for children\nAnd low and they may hit for a while but the parents pull out their hair and run screaming from the room and we would have none of that we wanted it to be really an ensemble experience for the whole family\nAnd who's tougher kids in the audience for adults in the audience in terms of the\nFans are the kids are very direct [laughter] you know if they don't like what you're doing they let you know but they're also very responsive and parents if they're if they're smart they participate with their children because they're doing it together and they're setting an example\nYou know there's one example years ago I says I have I had just finished I said boy I was a great song I really like though a lot of five year old voice from the back came out I hate it [laughter]\nReally love that [laughter] some amazing well the first album comes out and you think you know we're going to go off into her own things that was fun that was a lark but then came more albums live concerts television ramp how did that then all come out after that first album\nWell it was kind of stuff for our guess after we made the recording and then we did our first concerts at the young people's theater and that's why we've come back after forty years I think the next step after that was our parents at the Vancouver international children's festival and the following spring\nAnd is that was extremely exciting for us and I must say that CBC was a factor in that and in our career because it was really through CBC that people got to know about us so in the spring of Nineteen Seventy nine we went to Vancouver in the new um\nInterest from the public and from people who wanted us to perform for them and that and another record and it all unfolded in that kind of surprising way for us but by and exciting way yeah\nOne of the one of the things as we were actually being one of the concerts and greeting people goodbye shaking hands and saying hello to buy a one of the children said to us okay you can get back in the record now [laughter]\nAnd and speaking speaking of goodbyes now after this extraordinary I'm In a forty year career of recording and touring this is your farewell tour and I'm thinking about the song skin marine because it feels like kind of a perfect goodbye song\nAnd I understand that there may be new lyrics coming for them to make is this true yes indeed\nFirst of all skating rink has always been the perfect but by Don Was saying at\nIt came to us through a cousin of flowers she brought it back and we recorded it and it was been with us for all along\nI didn't even get to sing on it saying them Elvis Sharon segment harmony and I play the ukulele part on the high string guitar they didn't let me sing on it until record or two later [laughter]\nTo prove yourself had had no idea what\nThat song was going to be right and we love it and we never tire of it yeah and we were approached by penguin Random House to do with a skating rink puck and with the help of my daughter who wrote a new introduction to the song and new versus for the song\nAnd the the new words are delightful I'm were thrilled with him and the illustrator is channeling and it will be released in the fall of two thousand and I thought\nThat's already recorded and we're keeping it secret for right now\nNot smell pushing it but my singing it and you're sitting at so if you come to the farewell to our ... the new version of\nOf going to marry my dad also get to sing the parts of skating rinks that they're familiar with the we all your prize no I like that would be like are really are no to hold them bomb or a serious\nSerious serious bummer I'm a share and you'd you'd mentioned that ice skating rink had come through lowest in through her husband and Bram you said that to Lois had come to the group with a different musical background than than you and sharing so what did she\nBroil a shirt and I we're products of the folk music world just lost his background was classical music at the piano\nAnd also Broadway show music and she was kind of a jazz baby in the group and so one of the reasons that our repertoire there's such a mixture with some very hip songs like job that they don't mean the thing of it I got that swing and that sort of thing\nLast brought those to us and we said yeah\nYeah yeah well I think it also speaks to the fact that again you were weaving in these different you know musical traditions and genres and in speaking to also um multi generation audiences chew and holding them on\nTalking about that for the last few years I've said we've had three generations the kids their parents or grandparents who are all involved with us and just a few months ago a woman said to me I'm bringing my great grand children to your concert and I said for\nFor for ... for\nGenerations that's extraordinary to have you
