get to test video games for a living [noise] and then it quickly realize the pressure that you're under to make sure you are committed to the company in your your\nMom worked long hours and support the team you know when a leader board where uh you know I got third place with a hundred and Eighteen hours in one week and uh I think the person didn't want to have a hundred and twenty four hours\nThat's Canadian video game developer Adam voice these days Adam as CEO of iron galaxies studios but he's still remembers the intense hours he and his coworkers sport in the started his career\nRemember one project I was on where I'm because we're America just sat in a newborn baby and a real stretch where he slept in the office for nine days straight\nAnd I would just bring him close and I mean sure he was fed and his wife would bring um his daughter to visit um there's a bed and then there was a shower at the studio and it was cool we thought it was ... at the time we thought it was like wow do you see how much that person work and they they just wouldn't stop for anything\nOn it was it was she were held in high regard those are the people that you sort of aspire to be\nThat level of extreme overtime is so common in the gaming industry developers have a name for\nThey call it crunch and while Adam believes the crunch problem has gotten better in recent years it hasn't gone away rockstar games is the company behind blockbuster hits like LA Newark and grand theft auto next week they're releasing one of the most hotly anticipated games of twenty teens\nRed Dead redemption to\nAnd according to rock star cofounder Dan house or the team has been working extremely hard to prepare the game for launch\nKing a mention that they have been working hundred hour weeks on while I'm that's more than fourteen hours a day for seven days a week no days off\nHauser later clarified that remark he said that the corps for person writing team were the only ones working those hours and a number of other rock star employees have since back them up on that\nBut industry watchers say the gaming industry still has come to terms with the working conditions that Dr Brendan Sinclair has been following the story closely he's the north American editor for games industry biz I spoke to him on Wednesday [noise]\nSays that crunch is widespread in his industry happens everywhere so why are people so focused about what's happening at rock star\nI think people are focused on rock star because they sort of represent the biggest in the best the games that they make Red Dead redemption in the grand theft auto series are widely loved the last grand theft auto game a is about to sell its hundred million a copy so they are sort of\nThe standard bearer for the triple a big budget blockbuster game development industry but were you surprised to hear that employees a rock star which is obviously ... one of the most successful\nIt is getting ready for lunch I was not surprised at all rock star has a history of will say scuttlebutt around the industry painting them in a pretty negative light about nine or ten years back they released a game called manhunt to which was a initially developed by rock star Vienna\nThey shut down that studio put fifty people out of work had another team of theirs finish off the game ... released it with the credits of votes fifty people omitted from the game and the retail version when the original Red Dead redemption came out\nThere was an open letter called the rock star spouse letter [laughter] a witch accused the studio of mandating twelve hour work days six days a week or the employees would face a disciplinary action\nOr managers were told to uh get people to Russia until the deadline and then\nJust push the deadline back so that they would have been a permanent period of crunch and arbitrarily decide to reduce bonuses or time in lieu\nWhat did the spouses say the effect of all of this work was in on their lives\nThey claim that are just caused incredible mental and physical stress on them and their spouses [noise] the thing is everyone kind of knew there were these issues that rock star but Red Dead redemption the game itself sold millions and millions of copies everyone bought it\nThe rock star acknowledge your own any of the claims are allegations in the letter\nRock star has been consistent about denying or downplaying any of these claims whenever they come up throughout the company's history\nThere's a lot of if some employees didn't feel that they were valued or if some people felt like they were pressured to work hard and that wasn't what we wanted and we want a healthy environment but when you read between the lines of the corporate statements it does become clear that they have a culture\nThat definitely values people putting in those long hours as a matter of passion and dedication to the project\nAnd do you think that that's what ... what do you think that they hear these stories and they say oh people work to the bone to produce this game it's going to be a great game\nThat's something that's changed I think in the last decade or so five or ten years ago I think gamers were actually more likely to hear these stories glorifying and lying eyes and developers I think that was used as a marketing tool\nBut is there a sense that if you if you don't work these hours there was somebody more than willing to take your place and to just step into the traces and do the work themselves\nThere absolutely is these blockbuster game productions can have thousands of people working on them\nAnd they're largely new fresh faced people out of college who don't have family attachments or a ton of obligations\nAnd they can be made to put in the hours and then after a few years of that they burn out they find better pain employment in a in an adjacent field and the average career length in the industry right now I think is a about six years\nBut that sounds like a recipe for exploitation what do you make of the fact that Mr ... at a rock star has said that they have limited to one hundred hour work weeks to the four core people who are writing that game\nI'm very very skeptical of that claim a um we ran a story with a a former rockstar developer who was talking about working on grand theft auto for and said it was it like working seven days a week with a gun to my head Dan how's her statement that rock star put out clarifying us position saying it was just the four\nAnd now he's going after her calling her name\nThat CNN analyst April Ryan responding to President Trump's tweet earlier this week calling Stormy Daniels for space\nRyan is also the White House correspondent for the American urban radio networks and that's a job that she's been doing for more than two decades back to when Bill Clinton was president\nBut in her new book she says her job is changed drastically over the past two years the book is called under fire reporting from the front lines of the Trump White house and she has indeed come under fire at White House press briefings\nIt seems like you're hell bent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this White House safe because at the end of the day and let me in the game but you know what you're asking me a question and I'm going to answer which is the president I'm Sorry please stop shaking your head again that happened\nBarely three months into the current president's April Ryan is one of the only black women covering the White House and during the Trump presidency both her race and gender\nHave become part of the story and so is she in fact she's asked questions that have made national news here's one from February of last year this is the very first question April Ryan asked President Trump\nUntil he went to include the Congressional Black caucus and the congressional while I Would tell you what do you want to set up the meeting and you want to set up to a meeting no no no but I set up I Know some of them but I'm sure that's set up a meeting I Would love to meet with a Black Hawk is\nApril Ryan author of under fire your morning walk into the program\nGood morning thank you for having me\nThank you for being with us we just heard the first question that you asked of the president a month into his job why do you think Mr Trump asked you if\nYou were friends with the Congressional Black caucus\nAnd ... and you need to really read the book to understand what am I answer but let me let me think that a lot of people were thinking it was racial and may have been tennis racially but I looked at it more and then you didn't weigh in here because I just gotten into a fight went on in front of\nYou to be a very good friend of mine right is it about two weeks prior to and she was in his ear I'm sure\nMurray point which is not true I'm Sonia next question [laughter]\nThere's I've watched to ask you ... but all move on to the next question is why yet\n'cause she thought I'm going to say this to you and I and I'm going to end it on that we used to be friends very close right but once I became\nThe enemy of Donald Trump I was hurt in any she wanted to prove so for a few pieces that silver she wanted to throw a cut her friends head off and put it on a platter evidence Donald Trump\nAnd that's fine for her but it wasn't fine for me I Wish him well but as far as our relationship it's over I can forgive but I don't forget I Believe in redemption that she says for her to walk on one side of the street and not be on the other\nIn addition to calling the media the enemy of the American people\nThis president also singles reporters for criticism in and you believe that he has singled view out for your race your job [laughter]\nYou don't think oh most definitely you have when they don't like someone to go after them um you know not it was almost ... who was the president did it with Sean Spicer did it with Sarah Huckabee and do I need to go on\nOn the way they've attacked me and a lot on me and and and put a comment on my head they don't like me but I don't care I was there before they got there\nBut the fun out there when they're gone but when when they do this to you though it makes you part of the story and I know that you're not comfortable with that\nI'm not comfortable with that at all um I've been doing this job for Twenty one year and typically reporters just kind of fade into the background we observe and watch what's going on but I must be doing my out well for them to be that upset about me um\nYou know I don't I don't know why but not you know why and I'm I'm not going to play that game I Do know why I'm you know they perceive me not as their base\nIn my book the first chapter I I I think it's Nineteen and talk about on business I Know in order to unify people you have to find a common enemy I'm One of the most common enemy they found\nBut when he asked\nYou the Congressional Black caucus question you you said in the book that you thought that maybe you should quit\nOh ... yeah it was it was a combination of things it was on all those the fight that was ugly\nThan it was that and then that was Sean I said but I sat can't because I'm not coming out the am I going to be it was expanding but they that's all they wanted me to do they want me to quit and I no no no no no I Will ask questions and a lot of people don't get here\nAnd there will question they use their real answers\nHere's one of the questions that you asked the president that strikes me a rush to be the most provocative but you about this is from January and this year let's listen to this I Know which one okay here it is\nSo when Martin Luther King Day US President Trump's views are racist why did you feel that you had asked that question of the president on that day\nSome real questions you do you remember the timing of that do you remember what was happening around that\nThis was after the president asked the question about why America's accepting immigrants from countries that are not like way way\nThat's right people came out of that meeting federal lawmakers wound up coming out of that meeting saying oh my God you're pregnant called brown and black nation as a whole country\nAnd then just before that we had Charlottesville this for that and we had started the day that Johnson who was one of the soldiers who died ... um and it was a big back and forth about\n[laughter] you know that's been a lot of racial overtones in the White House and then I'll take the money\nOnly time in that moment with the backdrop of ... I was going to be around the president\nMany leaders not just black leaders were a lot of people say he's a racist you got to be careful how you label someone 'cause that's the six so I called the N. double ACP the night before and said what is the definition of racist and they said the definition of all races is simple it's the intersection or the meeting\nOf power and prejudice\nAnd so simple so I asked him Mr President are you a racist because people were saying and that question late in the air so much so that by Sunday night Monday morning because of the holiday weekend\nHe had to answer ... still they're still smarter about that question\nBecause you know ... ... ... ... the number of White House press make things right now you\nSound like a huge disaster [laughter] the number acts like a number of\nWhite House press briefings at an all time low and it it seems to me that they've been able to sideline the press corps from doing their job but they've been successful\nThat like it's about access it's about access to the principal and information in the late ... over ... ... when you suppress the ... when you press the press it there and begins a dictatorship\nI I don't know what you call this this is not democracy no checks and balances and now we're has died we demean we're told that we're the enemy we're told that we are the opposition party and it's to make people not believe us because we're telling a quest for truth and they don't like it\nAt the end of your book you say that that your journalism is now your form of protest but if you're taking a form of protesters that blur the lines of objective journalism and hours\nAnd let me tell you how I protest by doing my job\nI'm protesting by staying you're not going to push me away I tell the story the way it's in front of me and I'm fiercely trying to tell the story it accurately as I said my protest is staying in that job because you want me Don nope\n[noise] in the book you say when we administration decided that they wanted to make a target other view when Sean Spicer made an example of you that it hurt your children\nTry to make an example out of me which he now he's gone by going on\nBut well you said at the time though that this was hard on your kids at school\nIt was their collateral damage with all of this stuff\nIs ... I mean my kids and the greatness of the Internet and technology is that you get things in a moment's notice\nI'm sitting in that briefing wherever I guess the headlines flash while she and my oldest daughter's in current events class on a computer and she text messages me mommy you okay I said I'm great I knew something was going on\nSo that's the downfall of everything you don't want your kids comedy sci fi okay you're supposed to be calling them to say are you okay but you know I'm Shaun as a parent to and now Sean and had to reap the rewards if you will of his behavior at that podium\nDo you believe with Misha administration has done you'll still be in the White House press corps\nYou know what I've covered for presidents now Twenty one years\nI Would love to cover on I'm fifty one [laughter] we'll see what I have in me but I'm not going to stay for another one who knows I mean who knows who knows I could I could wind up being a press secretary for president who knows I don't know um\nBut right now I Love my job and I'm there I'm not planning on going anywhere I'm not planning on going anywhere right now unless you know something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20"}
