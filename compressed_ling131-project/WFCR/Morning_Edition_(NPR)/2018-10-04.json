disqualify somebody from this position let me ask you as a result of\nThe public debate over this we're seeing more women come forward with their own stories of sexual assault just yesterday former\nCBS News anchor Connie Chung wrote an op ed about her own assault fifty years ago when she was a college student there have been numerous of these testimonials coming out [noise]\nWhat do you make of them as someone who defends Brett Kavanaugh who is at the center of all this\nWell I I think that someone one woman's experience or or\nBecause there are other experiences and certainly women have um had these assault experiences and we know that they go unreported and a lot of cases and things like that but that does it on its own on its face doesn't make Brett Kavanaugh or any man guilty\nOf doing what they say they don't I mean in our country we have due process and you are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and this situation has been the complete opposite of that where he was presumed innocent based on a single accusation starting with it being anonymous\nThen it would be accusation had to face and a name to it\nThan there were four witnesses hall who could not corroborate that story\nBut have you ever had any friends who've had this happen to them to have people in your life who have suffered a sexual assault I'm sure that I Do yeah and how many men do you know who's ever been falsely accused\nI don't they haven't told me who the who they're accuser who they're accusing so I Know it's a very small percentage but that does it's about I think ten percent of the cases I think that the data shows it just doesn't mean that\nBrett Kavanaugh is guilty because Ninety percent of the men who are accused are guilty ... there are men who are accused of things and they're not guilty\nOr we can look at UVA can look at um a visit to do across you know there are instances and frankly this one is a very public one um the timing of this was incredibly suspect\nUm there's a lot of holes and the stories of um doctor\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories ...

one's name right that you can't recount necessarily yelled at home or one thing but\nLies or other things I mean I'm you know fear of flying not true\nThe second door on the house um again that the data they the history shows that was that you like indoor was put on for years before the therapy session that apparently was about\nThis incident there are a lot of things like I said in the testimony that Rachel Mitchell did not follow up on that uh you know now are coming out after the fact\nAnd the fact that we were holes in her story we we do not know it is true that we don't have conclusive evidence either way may never we may never but I just wondering closing is there any part of you that wonders what if I'm wrong what if you did you\nKnow there actually isn't um and it's just not enough in our country to make an accusation against somebody anybody for any job any position or just for their life without having some cooperation\nUm you know maybe the lesson is that women if these things happen to you need to either report them confide in somebody or something like that so that you know you have a strong case but\nThat's not the case here um and and all three of
