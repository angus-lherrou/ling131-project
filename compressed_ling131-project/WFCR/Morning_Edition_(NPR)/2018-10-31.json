MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota and a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the eye\n[laughter] because I Do too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally ... it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties kind of move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group and there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in uh in uh\nStreaming of New England public radio was wounded ... university graduate schools MO food and creative non fiction writer and roller no for August ... ... ... do you\nWatch it but my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and you know kids who go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape\nShort it was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and\nImmigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but everything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with ice when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise] so I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I ... how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nAn issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what

storytelling at our website or wherever you get your podcasts\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\n[noise] so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and not coming election [noise] have you talk to your family\nStreaming of New England public

Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say he has to visit rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey her for his story at at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism\nSeems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy

here the smartest me [noise]\nThe the lead you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is\nTo bring harm to the Jewish people know so then what's the connection he wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how\nTo appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and\nIt's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation

stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer aligned with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about politics social issues that we were always encouraged to\nVoice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise] as you started\nWe're so much for the last year we do know the good news and public radio certain and you'll just be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first moved to North open your blood red zone maybe ... minutes\nAfter the twenty

don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with ice when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there is another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism

participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know

Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel

your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at

documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her story it at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros they'll go to first and only go so I don't get paid\n[noise] ... from our content

that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her far use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory\nThe Jews run the world purpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest me you know what are they talking about they talk about is the lead you ever see the elite\nWhen people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know so then what's the connection he wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how\nTo appeal to the resentments and hatred that his face and you can order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public
