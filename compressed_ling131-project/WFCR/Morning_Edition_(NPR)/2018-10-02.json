three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about

V. S. dot org\nWon't happen here in New England Public radio we will receive any of that money or play any part in those commercials because we don't sell political advertising and we all benefit from the fact that we don't do that\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand times on it well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outline but just the conditions of workers is is this change will result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you count in all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff Bass was came to speak in Washington I'm a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making\nHuge amount of money um\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by un Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online K. to twelve school personalizing education for Massachusetts students know enrolling for fall gee CVS dot org\nJust how ... how vast Amazon has become and a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big and they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking\nTruck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of um you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail um and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big a thing in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars\nUm this is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of people who might be looking for employment right during the holiday\nSeason All right great explainer NPR business reporter Alina Selyukh for
