I came across for example in in in one city the city of weeks that was closer to the border with bought 'em all the people [noise]\nUh I remember the mayor saying that they had eight people who'd accepted trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and among that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise]\nUm [noise] but it it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than a usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question that everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Amherst", "day": "30"}
