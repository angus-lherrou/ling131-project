Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers

more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets a nice little extra\nIt it really is the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably global sales have been out\nFacing your domestic says

time we you know you have distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less

whacking Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their

agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect their willingness for some who had been at it for a long time

if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be the divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if you try to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or nine here Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we're dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and
