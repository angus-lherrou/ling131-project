com\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a rider we practice that I still have now\nBut that writer we practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we face up\nTo the outside world your mother a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse\nAnd you know and I was around ... chance she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the

to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing costs just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with a bully in that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just ate\nSo here's a hip to any yours offering a special sale deal on tickets for our jazz baby

obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body pushing my body pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I've had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping and broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely like trash\nAnd I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction\nSo here's a tip any yours offering a special pre sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party going us for an evening advancing ... taught sex\nAnd sipping some bubbly
