he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but are a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get uh\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the hotel Northampton offering six meeting at events bases from board room to ballroom with Avi equipment an inhouse catering hotel north Hampton dot com\nOr have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV that are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ...\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just diseases and haunt you\n[laughter] uh you know there there there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition\nIn ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to decipher because uh I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high political advertising is reflect\nWe have so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz Bebe Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first to the hotel

in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like health care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college

that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement then we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to just stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of

of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're insight\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Kurdish yeah um how could you not and I missed Carl
