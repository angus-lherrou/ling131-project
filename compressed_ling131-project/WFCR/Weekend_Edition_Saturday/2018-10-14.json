political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down he Jessica Hi Lulu so Ken Democrats cut into the geo piece edge among governors they haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for\nDemocrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor\nAnd that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things

talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role and places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much\nThank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on

and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is

thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now they're just homes wiped clean from their slabs and and all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force

here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been\nIn Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee and there\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ...\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was
