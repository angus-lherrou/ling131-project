Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure on the development of this story playing out in the

issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king Solomon of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the

members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are\nAre journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not the

Charlotte Gallagher in London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash scheduled I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain that Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with\nBut if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more\nBecause the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottles\n[noise] and if the situation would reverse would Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margin\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot EDU\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut\nBecause again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic runs states the taxes are simply July\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is um redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors\nThat will happen before the twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was

revealed DNA tested tried Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs\nOur politics but also polarized she said we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity and we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work than they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people that different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down a terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century\nThey're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings with a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations

and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to the very should run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real negative concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you could do that with our boat you cold Radley weaponize identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning
