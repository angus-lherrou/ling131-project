know um and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been that's a process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of political ideas of twenty teens\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island\nBut we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are you're an idea now\nAnd I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe leads us to an interesting question how are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's awesome lonely\n[noise] it is and if any thing\nThere are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of us experience is

worry about people showing up to my advantage there\nWas an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they made a point of rain out that when you talk to kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be named yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect the political tactics more\nOh no no I feel like I learned it from my parents and when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nFunnily enough my parents were never political you know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that but\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community I went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there and that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nOf the kinds of people that I went to school in\nAnd my dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite the cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... ... talk because those are the people that are family could relate to they were always about leaning in to people and the politics come second and that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics what is your Buffy the

and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data have a story behind it [noise] you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nLike Washington Heights affect the wake of the day you wake up and I got the plug case because\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar local TV design at installation helping household secure state or federal incentives that live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community\nAnd actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about while I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered if it wasn't getting out that\nActually the the different communities within Latino Americans and was going to New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised you well I'm\nWorking in New York City schools and in your policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language in English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities of Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican orange and in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together on this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nSo I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nReally interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly and\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences at psychology a icy dot edu\nDominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compared to Puerto Ricans the schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what\nWe find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans book the New York in other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the costs going culture may not be as strong [noise]", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Amherst", "day": "29"}
