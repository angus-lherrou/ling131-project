you to WG the wife for hosting us in the audience for being here\nThere's two things I'm hoping that people watching will take away from tonight and the first is that I Will be your full time senator for the next six years a repeat that I'll be your fulltime senator for the next six years\nAnd the only thing that matters to me is what matters to the people of Massachusetts that's why I lead a repeal of the index gas tax saving taxpayers two billion dollars\nThat's why I stood up to special interest to stop the Olympics from taking ten billion dollars in a boondoggle\nIn fact I Want to stop the poisonous politics is infected Washington DC and the obstruction that's been led by my opponent and I've spent more than a year talking with people listening to them not lecturing them\nAnd that's why I Would like to be your voice and I'm asking for your vote on November six\nThank you and representative the first question goes to you this evening\nFlooding which has traveled our reason in recent years is among the range of problems everything United Nations report said that climate change is causing\nCanada is considering a national carbon tax isn't viable option for paying for the impact that illusion which scientists say leads to climate change can have on the United states\nWhere you can't deny the fact that we are feeling the effects of climate change and I think that uh in Massachusetts we've done a strong job of moving towards renewable energies are we've invested in fact I voted for legislation that has increased uh our goal on wind power off the shores are at the same time we've been part of a Reggie agreement that has\nTried to make sure that there were one of the cleanest regions in the country so I think Massachusetts has been doing it very well\nThis affects though not just a inland obviously this affects coastal areas as you've been talking about with a flooding but also the fishing industry for example with warmer water is off our shores we're starting to see different species coming in our fishermen are trying to catch\nYou know the traditional cod and other fish out there and other species of now going in there\nUnfortunately that restricts the amount of\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by Ewan Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online K. to twelve school personalizing education for Massachusetts students now enrolling for fall gee CVS dot org\nWays with the catch limits as well now unfortunately the fishermen in New Bedford one of our bridges ports in the United states has had the sector nine ground fishing industry virtually come to a standstill because there's been\nForty federal fishing licenses that have not been transferred my opponent has been asked by this New Bedford city council four times specifically four times the inner ... seed and help with the fishing industry with no regulation so they can have a stronger voice I think that's also an important part of the discussion when it comes to the effects of climate change\nSenator Warren ill or an idea of the question is carbon a carbon tax a viable option to help this issue here in the United states\nSo it's clear to me that we need a way to make polluters pay for the damage they do and there are a lot of different ways we can do that one I'll just start right here locally and that is made GE pay to clean up the who satanic river\nUm they originally agreed to and then once Donald Trump was elected they backed up and said well no let's renegotiate again and now they don't want to have to move the pollution that they caused out of state\nYou know that's one of the consequences though of what Mr deal wants to do as Donald Trump's campaign chair\nWhen Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord not a peep from Mr deal when coal lobbyist was put in as the head of the EPA not a peep from Mr deal you want to talk about fishing\nOne of the things that Mr deal has said is that he embraces offshore drilling I Want you to think about that and what that would mean for Massachusetts\nWe have offshore drilling off the coast of Massachusetts one spill like the kind of spills that happened down in the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd all of our fishing industry is wiped out our tourism industry on the east coast is wiped out\nAnd the way of life that we have nurtured for centuries will be gone but\nClimate change is real and it is urgent problem that we need to bear down on it and we need to bear down on it now I have a bill to try to push corporations to do more on climate change at all starting to say one thing about our\nShores so a much like the center who mistakenly thought that I was at a police rally there was some sort of tied to some rain\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by

with Jim and Marjory talking specifically on record as saying I'm against anything that's going to affect our fishermen and the wind turbine placements that we're trying to get done to create more energy here in Massachusetts\nUm the other thing too are affecting the environment that's really bad and I think we need to make sure we focus on is this the F ... that have been a found on military bases right out here west field or the other thing too is that is also found on turnout gear for firefighters causing a health risk for them including cancer and I think uh companies like\nDupont who are manufacturing it had been responsible for the bees should also be held responsible there I think senator one minute\nSo I thought that Mr deal might want to go with what he said on W. GBH to the people of Massachusetts\nBut on September twenty six twenty Seventeen when he was on the southern sense radio Mr deal said quote you have to have all the options on the table and so to me offshore drilling any and all places where we can get that energy in a reasonable way is quote\nI'm all for it on her words he goes and says one thing somewhere else I'm all for offshore drilling it comes to Massachusetts knows well maybe not so much because he thinks the W. GBH audience might not be quite so supportive\nYou know and he raised the point twice now about the rallies that he attended there was a rally in born\nOrganized by act for America a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a hate group and described as quote the largest anti Muslim group in America he was there on April ... April twenty second twenty Eighteen the photograph actually\nShowed the group and at that time that time we're going to move on to our next question which was the first senator warn the American outdoor brand corporation formerly Smith in Washington which is based right here in Springfield provides needed jobs at the same time guns for used in Springfield\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in Kunar riddle architect or forty year legacy of commitment to community a design celebrating the next generation of leadership acute riddle dot com\nWashington and B that single vote to repeal health care for tens of millions of Americans yeah I'm trying to help people around the country in other states\nBecause I Want some allies down in Washington the best way I can protect healthcare right here in Massachusetts is to have more people in Washington who care about health care\nBy the way that repeal of health care that Mr deal has embrace Donald Trump is embraced the Republicans have embraced would conduct Massachusetts more than two billion dollars every single year and repeal the protections for people with preexisting conditions this really matters\nCenter worn thank you and the next question does start when you were talking about Social Security plan so there are Fifteen Years until Social Security is expected to pay eighty cents on the dollar do you see a way to fix the system to avoid those benefits being reduced\nSo I appreciate the question but I actually think the frame a little bit with respect to send the wrong place the Republicans just gave away a trillion and a half dollars to giant corporations and billionaires through a tax scam\nAnd now the debt has one and what if the Republicans said is the appropriate response now it's time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat the Republican plan not wait not strengthen it put it on the chopping block so let me just stop right here and say I will never vote to cut Social Security I Will never vote to cut Medicare these are basic programs that people have paid for it that they are entitled to\nThe idea that the Republicans are running a scam saying we're going to give billions of dollars oh wait a giant corporations that now have\nRecord tax and ... a record profits\nAnd then turn around and take it out on the backs of people who collect Social Security and rely on Medicare\nWe don't need to cut Social Security and Medicare we need to expand it I have already introduced legislation I introduced ... years ago to say as we need to move forward on making Social Security stronger financially\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in a path university graduate schools and as a creative non fiction writing and roll and go for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu lifetime hard work you should be entitled\nTo that time was thank you very much or do you see a way to fix them so that benefits to Social Security won't be renting\nIs happening right now in fact my opponent has vowed to repeal the very mechanism that his refueling Social Security and Medicare the tax reform of two thousand Seventeen which she voted against which she has vowed to repeal\nHas now created new jobs has created increase wages that create the payroll taxes that go into refill now we as a country are starting to see in just a year the effects of this tax reform bill giving us\nFour point one GDP\nRecord unemployment fifty years since we've had unemployment at the level it's at now Massachusetts has actually beating the national number on unemployment Massachusetts has benefited greatly eighty percent of Massachusetts residents received a tax cut\nBecause of this tax reform bill but Senator Warren joined a Nancy Pelosi and calling it crumbs saying that the people were\nNot getting what they were they were doing which is finally a break from federal government so we're seeing people now having more jobs are having higher wages and in Massachusetts are state revenues exceeded one point two billion dollars in unanticipated tax revenue because of all the investment companies are putting into it and by the way I Want to add\nMy wife and I own a small business we invested our life savings to start it we've had it for sixteen almost Seventeen years now and you know what it's time for government to finally help us from the largest corporate rate in the world to allowing us to finally reinvest in our business is Ninety percent of businesses in our country our twenty employees are lower their\nParents are thank you and your about all US Senator Warren some people have suggested raising the retirement age to Seventy two with a solution to this ... thing\nI think that's the wrong approach I think the right approach is that we put the money into Social Security that it takes to meet our obligations\nBut let's be clear what the Republicans want to do it just run a scam on the American people and the scam start by cutting revenues to the federal government\nYou know the idea that somehow the federal government's getting richer chats effect on this the debt is going up and the Republicans are saying openly this is even a secret\nTime to put Social Security and\nDreaming of New England public radio is made possible by you among ICQ's garage in Williamsburg offering foreign and domestic on

gets more in tax breaks than Ninety five percent of all the people in the commonwealth of Massachusetts those breaks didn't go to small businesses they went to a giant businesses because that's who the Republicans want government to work for\nEverything in your about all the same question and raising the retirement age to Seventy two is that something he would be in favor of\nNo it's not something we should do in fact government is taking in record revenues they'd never taken in more tax revenue than before however what's needed is sending someone to Washington that's going to also do this type of part of cutting spending now\nOn beacon hill I took on special interest to repeal the index gas tax when I knew that we were wasting\nBillions of dollars of taxpayer money it wasn't going where it was supposed to fifty percent of the gas tax at the time was going to the MBTA which had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance their pension fund was upside down they were asking us to fact fill it over and over again one year we found out a year later the twenty five million dollars had been stolen\nBy a fund manager that worked for the MBTA pension fund then went to work for another company\nOr to take that money so look government has the revenue and you just have the fiscal discipline to try to make sure it's been where it's supposed to go that's why you need to send someone who is willing to stand up to things like the Olympics center to warn her rating on cutting spending zero\nHave to leave it there thank you and the next question does go to you representative\nPresident Trump who you've said he was deported had called people names he's called them horse race on Twitter he called them flakes he's used ethnic slurs doesn't name calling and personal attacks that are coming in Washington these days lead to effect of governing in your opinion and if elected\nWhat do you do anything to combat these types of attacks\nYou know carry it is disappointed to see how Washington dysfunction you know I certainly don't\nFollow the same path that the president does on how I legislate\nOr how I deal with people but at the same time my opponent has made comments that are pretty disturbing as well she said that anybody who voted for the president was part of an ugly stew of racist okay she said that when Republicans wanted to try to fix health care that we wanted blood money from the American people\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for

I certainly won't follow the path of Senator Warren on trying to villain I didn't hit us together that's not what our country needs right now\nI don't want to make sure that when I go down to Washington we followed by example on that now at the same time if you look at the president and his track record I Will say that we're finally seeing economic benefits from being in office we're seeing international benefits you know a year ago we had North Korea threatening our allies with nuclear weapons\nAnd now a year later we're seeing them having repeated meetings with South Korea even thinking about doing the Olympics with them which I also don't think is a financially good idea\nI think he's a Senator Warren for your part you often criticized President Trump and his name calling yeah your campaign sent out an email in may titled quote Mick Mulvaney the mosquito and that went on to say calling members of the president's staff quoting here blood suckers and henchmen\nHow do you justify calling President Trump out for his name calling but then using language like that\nOkay so what we called him and mosquito right but here's the deal what we're really talking about\nHateful illness against groups against how it is you pick the most vulnerable and really go after them and you know I understand my opponent stance here he sounds reasonable he says this is not how he wants to debate\nBut just look at his own record and who he's been supporting\nHim toward the border with the leader of a group that associates with white supremacists and wants to return this country to a time when quote gays were in the closet and blames Jews for nine eleven he attended a rally organized by the largest anti Muslim hate group he supported naming black\nLives matter as a hate group he defended Trump's racist attacks against a Latino federal judge look he stayed on his Trump's campaign chairman even after the Access Hollywood tapes came out\nHe got the endorsement of vice president Pence who spearheaded legislation to permit discrimination against L G B.

people and when we're driving from let's say agawam up to a Pittsfield sometimes you lose your wife I sometimes you lose a your cell phone connection we do need communications infrastructure because communications infrastructure will allow central and western Massachusetts\nTo bring some of the businesses that are currently overcrowding\nEastern Massachusetts is great that the seaport in Boston has\nGE and has med tech in these\nCompanies that are coming in and building you know new headquarters in Boston is wonderful but there's a lot of people who need those opportunities those jobs in central and western Massachusetts so we have the communications infrastructure that incentivize is\nThe business has to come out here as far as rail I totally agree now obviously the first thing you have to think about is the fact that we're currently having a tough time affording the rail system we have so maybe we look at\nPrivate partnerships to get real back out here that's how this country and the state first started private industry I Know Senator Warren says that you didn't build that when she first ran for office she said it was government roads will have to tell you it was the machine shops in Springfield in Holyoke it was the shoe factories in Brockton it was the\nFishing industry of bluster New Bedford that's what built the private schools and private hospitals that first took care of people provided the money to build those roads we need to make sure businesses are given a chance to grow as well so we can have those funds to build\nEven senator one minute so this is the standard Republican playbook sitting all in favor of infrastructure somehow the public sector doesn't really have to put up the money the private sector is going to do it\nStreaming of New England

org\nHow many times have politicians like Mr deal stood up and said over and over yeah we need that high speed rail in totally in favor that high speed rail\nBut when it comes down to it won't vote to be to put the funds in so that you can actually build the high speed rail look we ought to be putting real money and at the federal government level and we could do that except for the fact\nThat the Republicans Mr deal Donald Trump have given away a trillion and a half dollars\nTo billionaires and giant corporations it's the ultimate question of who government works for it shouldn't be working just for the rich and the powerful infrastructure is how we build a future for all of us are present in one minute\nSure we'll look I Know about infrastructure when we did the gas tax ballot question in two thousand fourteen we knew exactly where a lot of money was going on where it should have been going and we're too much money was going in fact in Massachusetts where number two to New Jersey for what we spend to maintain our roads\nAnd so when we want to build rail we need to have the money available and not wasted in other areas Massachusetts spends six hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nPer mile per year to maintain our roads now the national average is a hundred and forty five thousand dollars\nPer mile per year All right that's New Hampshire they pay the national average their roads are in pretty good shape Massachusetts could be spending their money more efficiently that were to leave us the money to put it where we need it whether it's going to be improving the rail system that we have\nThat had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance over the last decade or whether it's making sure that we can try new lines to get more service to get more people to and from job locations that are going to help grow the economy and pay the taxes that build the rail\nYou and the right to answer to the next question\nThat it tells us that the Hispanic population in western Massachusetts is growing and according to the few Research Center the number of Hispanics eligible to vote has steadily grown yet they're voting in mid term elections has declined since two thousand and six according to peel\nHave you taken steps to reach out to minority voters while you've been campaigning\nWell sure I mean of course when you're going out ah talking to people on the campaign trail you attend parades you go door to door you go to different communities of course\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and cute little architect or forty year legacy of

it's not to me are campaigning about trying to reach just one segment but I Will say you know as far as the Hispanic community and not voting that's not good to hear and perhaps they're feeling the same thing a lot of people are feeling disgust\nWith the people that are currently elected discussed with the Washington in the way it's functioning maybe distrust would begin Helen how they don't seem to be looking after the interest of the people we have more and more ballot questions\nGoing on every year instead of legislators actually doing their job we have to decide nursing levels we have to decide marijuana laws you know what casinos had to be put in the hands of the people why aren't lawmakers doing what they're supposed to be doing so if any one segment of our state\nIs not happy
