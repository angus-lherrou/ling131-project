there's also a piece on domestic violence basically if you if you look at every piece as\nA whole you will see that aid is defiance of the legacy of colonialism\nAnd it is a reclaiming of our power our dignity and our culture as a people\nBut I feel that that's ... to all people\nWe all should embrace cultural memory of who we are and where we come from and I think that's why we're seeing such
