harming humans in stifling the tourism industry\nAnd there was a fourth wave that could alter the future of the sunshine state and that's in the twenty Eighteen midterm elections Republican governor and us senatorial candidate Rick Scott has been praised for his handling of hurricane emergencies but he's being blamed by protesters for the massive algae problem\nRick Scott holds a narrow lead in most polls over his Democratic opponent incumbent Senator Bill Nelson but anti algae activists could influence turn up\nFor a look at how the algal blooms might influence Florida politics in November we turn to political senior reporter Michael Grunwald welcome to living on her thanks for having me\nSo briefly for our listeners who just may not be up to speed on this issue what are these red and green toxic algae blooms and\nWhy are they impacting Florida's coastline and the first place\nWell as you mentioned we have two different types of algae blooms one is this kind of neon green guacamole collapse that it's toxic and has been linked to cancer and various testicular problems and then you have\nThese sort of rust colored red tide and that's where you've probably seen on TV the millions of fish\nAre rolling up dead on the white sand beaches of the west coast and essentially a you know you're talking about microorganisms that as a Rick Scott's\nAdministration is always pointing out they are naturally occurring but they feed on nutrients the crud that human beings put into the water\nAnd that's what really super charges them and make them bloom\nAnd right now we've got a real nutrient problem and that's why you've seen it really you know taking off and destroying the tourist economy on both coasts\nHow important is the health and safety of Florida's waterways to its

have for us today\nWell Imran Khan was a provincial politician in Pakistan\nA his province had seen huge environmental degradation from deforestation from timber theft and as a provincial official he
