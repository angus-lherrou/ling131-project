he styles himself in the manner of uh the late Justice Scalia who has a textural less a strict construction is and what that means of course is that he looks to the text of a statute when he's asked

Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientist with the inner governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael with only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial\nBut this new report finds that have to agree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal was going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author for high PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael glad to be here again\nBecause of the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nThey are projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not toward the end of the century but very close a matter of\nA decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the hotel Northampton offering six meeting at events bases from boardroom to ballroom with Avi equipment an inhouse catering hotel north Hampton dot com\nOf this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the inter governmental panel on climate change produces\nThorough assessments of all our knowledge on climate change every six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports and I'm working on the next special report\nWhich is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we made just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach the net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has\nHas put on it is sort of like twelve years of we don't do it we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to win and cause that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states but it'll make life just miserable expensive\nSo here's the hip to any ER is offering a special piece he'll deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December

are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible\nBut the real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organize to actually reinvent themselves to be not independence of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do than as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nAt the most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible reducing end eventually eliminating our dependence on petroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the\nBiggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminated dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards the ... century it seems we're going to need a way\nTo suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things the\nThird thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency in production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out patterns of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade would be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for too fast\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences and psychology a icy dot edu\nThe difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out and started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat and flooding\nThat they were big differences between one and a half and two degrees I mean give me an example already by one and a half degrees\nRural or is\nIt is hard to figure out exactly where it's coming from and that's the point of it only the lions and the lioness is now\nAnd
