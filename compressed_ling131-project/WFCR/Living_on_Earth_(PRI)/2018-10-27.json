county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know it'd be very well respected experts that we had lined up to testify for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from NASA\nAnd Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was just sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience\nYou know it would have been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference\nSo they thought that this kind of trial might happen in in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really have an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you heard the judge to let you use the necessity defense\nAnd he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for for the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have constrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden this\nWas the fact that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did you know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves and to prevent the greater harm of climate change\nWe did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle on climate change you know we're not\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by un Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online

about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota so you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope when we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry in the room you know when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge says in the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeds to go ahead to quit you of the charges\nRight that was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and local Enbridge employee and all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the locked\nInto the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that\nSo we were charged under a statute which was one of the sort of enhance penalties statutes that are being shoved through state legislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters\nAnd the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipeline\nAnd the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged a pipeline in any way\nYeah and ... who is essential he wasn't really that there wasn't evidence for reasonable jury to convict us basic right ah it as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage the pipeline right\nI'm going to ask you to speculate a bit both of you in a family about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your

have been I'm thinking you know whether his mind might have changed\nAbout what kind of precedent he wanted to set and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it certainly something we've been wondering about he seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so you know there by faceless quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget to that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThe fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and
