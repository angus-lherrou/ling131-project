real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our

... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had

running and I just I could not in all consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that ...\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your engineering for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway ... group it small enough to fit in in the ... someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and\nShe'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark except students faces live by their cell phone and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she is on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is the police anyone in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I thought it I'm not sure what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training very slowly\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you a big university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator enrolling for October ... second

are saying they were caught\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see is the teacher who's ... is she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind\nActually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have vending that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me\nThat having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective in these drills at Xavier University

specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I

to\nDo that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise] shows that people\nNeed many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort in sight basically trust your ability to

does she probably save lives probably in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him
