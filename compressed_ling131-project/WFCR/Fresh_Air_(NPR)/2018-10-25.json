recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight

in the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add a hotel Northampton offering six meeting at a vet spaces from boardroom to ballroom with Avi equipment an inhouse catering hotel north Hampton dot com\nShocked what the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nSports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars and it doesn't pay and under certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was uh\n[noise] we had so much about last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz

you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nWhen it come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think the difference will be just in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity\nI think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal
