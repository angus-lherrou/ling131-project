was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate

understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least um I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other\nMental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless\nYourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bill jak horsemen and some of them\nJust like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them said made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation causation chicken or egg conversation to have here\nBut on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely was a period in mind\nStreaming of New England public radio is meant possible lung

get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this
