where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict at least justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and during for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often\nThey choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left to the political branches that cheaply means Congress\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance\nI don't for example think you will see recusal Z\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kavanaugh recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas to part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to eight they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects a\nLeaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true part is and self\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area what kinds of cases do you think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then I don't know if this was

that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ... I think it helps to uh in feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and teach Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference at the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of laws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past dot edu\nDegree of loyalty because the president can't do anything at that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nProclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms\nOf and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time once they're up there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with a core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\nApproved ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course that nomination ... toasts to lack that\nOh the they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives want an instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we I won't go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him now I happen to think\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at ... university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nConservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be you're closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional is him his affection for the court and for its own reputation may\nLead him in ... on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then ... in that direction and for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David ...

Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture list I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch or Kavanaugh an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot\nThere is no causing the constitution that says thou shall interpret me based on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that

century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution [noise] do you think\nThat justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their stellar credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that ... was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first since that you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues than you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role
