morning\nSasha welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black\nOr white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find done black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter and you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about and securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... ... hours had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nDo and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gas\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by Ewan Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online cages will school personalizing education for Massachusetts students know enrolling for fall gee CVS dot org\nAlready have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care of caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and\nThat's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In ... is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now there's\nSome really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm France and\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's heartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I

nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by my race is like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism instead I was just saying yeah\nHe didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOh what did they really believed that there was a difference between white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they they don't

went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacists and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening

that\nIt would have been a not as effective at\nAllowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermine the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course
