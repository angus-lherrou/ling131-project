hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw it I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to dad and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw\nEspecially that the flow of loans increase as Donald Trump took on big new projects or they increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese were

decision\n[noise] so the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his dad's out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred

that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in

and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning to the ... million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nAnd the families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who
