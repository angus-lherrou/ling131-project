happen get you're glad rags zone and get your tickets today at NPR done that\nWay [noise] um so that so that was actually hit friendly but\nIf I can tell from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know they were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more going to get out of that yeah yeah precisely and even if you did have hits you know you\nGot a year or two and then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nA but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the wall side again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I'm going to look to never wanted

people for like [laughter] honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um\nSo I'm In his ... he said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise] um well\nOne thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away where you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and\nYou know he in an interview again at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of the arising about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um\n[noise] you know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean 'em got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften
