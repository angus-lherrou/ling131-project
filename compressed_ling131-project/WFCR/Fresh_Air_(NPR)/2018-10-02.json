landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nWanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change he was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by

previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pack because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity we were studying the way people judge\nRisk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or

putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it caught him into ... shows you that people don't really feel this and that inside is
