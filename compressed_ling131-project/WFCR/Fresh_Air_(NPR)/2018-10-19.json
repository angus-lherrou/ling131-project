that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time of his ... that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to\nNearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you are in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think it it is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of timing trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone you know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are\nJust fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nSo that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important that we learned is that there isn't just one way there isn't just one way to get health again sober and to stop using the first thing that they're told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWill see fat with a um

higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nDavid did you find that you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define that in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to Al Anon meetings I was told by someone\nBefore this is over you will believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in prayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said\nI'm

don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously

hung up the phone and I whipped\nBazaars thing I'd ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but she absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options and I can think of one is to say well if I'm not driving need rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home in a while and you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nSitting retrospect do you think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which is what have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different and in retrospect it was fine in

it's it's yes you can it's not easy and some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate schools an ass and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past dot edu\nSo he would call me up and he would be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but\nUm I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but\nWhatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes neck would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he ... he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time they relapse you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us and soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt either the craving\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences and psychology a icy dot edu\nSo much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so when they got in that play on that day I saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been ... step program\nIs probably going to you know a a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book so you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program so I think most people know what the positive\nA part time but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nTwelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem I have it's not what the twelve steps it's lonely many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and saying I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going
