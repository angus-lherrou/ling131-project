[noise]\nSo I don't normally followed the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits and football would have been ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at ... university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator ... enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nMore likely to engage in risky behaviors like excessive drinking but that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions in New Hampshire ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain as younger that's when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefits seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nYeah well I I don't know if I have an issue with high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner like really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you had the whole town behind you know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise it self esteem of the athletes to perform because you've got eleven guys on the field as one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt\nIf you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across the country [laughter] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football instead that they don't really need to go in there with that yeah and I'm totally reservoir and yeah yeah yeah and you know Tom rainy and demand\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December refers to the hotel north up and get your blood red zone or get your tickets today at any time you're done\nMe in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like would would that would the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at a voice the obvious solution to\nSee that the G League is a now offered an alternative to the NCAA's one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft\nTo come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year you choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for W. NBA player\nAnd that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness era but assigned with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the G leak so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom the perspective as usa in college when you're playing against guys your own age also the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players by just allowing him to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their lightness and the science shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the ... sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing\nCool that sad probably the best possible outcome from is right or at least as I see it wouldn't be that the threat of\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by Ewan Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online K. to twelve school personalizing education for Massachusetts students know enrolling for fall gee CVS dot org\nUs to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because I just feel like at a ... only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an old tired if that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these half high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know super it has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and a league that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ...\nAnd the fact that they would\nMaybe Maureen has a better television do you eat\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one man [laughter]\nI totally agree I I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes\nMuch more significantly than we do females well we ...

issue to me as a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker that blackout this loose on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono became qualified to run USA Gymnastics true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you have alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to

because we're smart Karen and the more people to listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation Jerry Jones\nBombing mayor down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys have been pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and was cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend\nI really love about this story is that they actually came up with actual data that showed that tweets made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans after football was
