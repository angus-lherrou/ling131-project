Health training center the Lakers training facility\nIs a nice nice building as if it's a sports franchise worth more than three billion dollars but the Lakers are more than just a basketball team right they are a global brand and one of the great teams in the NBA history although not recently and not really the season yet but more about that in a minute\nFundamentally the Lakers are and this

know how we operate behind the scenes\nAnd so this building is a walkable building there is no barriers that you can make a full circle without having to divert through anything or being stopped and backtrack\nSo let's go off all your so I'm sure it's going to walk and talk show okay or they'll follow me do\nThis way and as you noted as we have I think six or seven conference rooms or this one is
