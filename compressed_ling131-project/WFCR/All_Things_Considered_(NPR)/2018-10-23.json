analyzed by the American civil liberties union the ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nThanks for having me so we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification ... [noise]\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online K. to twelve school personalizing education for Massachusetts students now enrolling for fall gee C.

because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will

instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with a caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that\nGroup ah there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first lost his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nMaybe the cat\n\n[noise]\nOn that list with was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we haven't been hearing too\nStreaming of New England public radio

considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want election and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by Ewan Greenfield commonwealth virtual school of public online K. to twelve school personalizing education for Massachusetts students know enrolling for fall gee CVS dot org\nOr finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or not words aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects
