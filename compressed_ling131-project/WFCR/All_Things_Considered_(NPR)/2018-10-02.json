maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nThere are several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblin remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn a small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers in size which was about six or seven times smaller than what to do is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find an object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about two or\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like er it's it's a very elongated lips next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun\nObjects this far out with really elongated orbits are just weird occurrence\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nBecker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers thinkers out there\nAnd easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planet like Jupiter or Neptune canceling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by but the goblin doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planning on so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of a picture in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that like I the kicker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects\nCertainly the goblet gives new confidence

printed out and I do not think that's a fair characterization\nAnd this back and forth for people who are looking for\nBrett Kavanaugh not being fully truthful about his drinking this this back and forth would be where you would find that uh there have been a lot of people who've come forward and said\nThey think that actually was a pretty fair characterization I should add though that the White House has delivered to me statements from a couple of people who Kavanaugh went to college with including a sweet mate\nWho says that he saw a cabin on not just at the end of the night but also in the morning and said that he did not see behavior that involved blackouts or anything at the level that has been described by others\nSo what are you make of these dueling narratives that we heard represented by President Trump and Senator Schumer having listened to the testimony about whether he was truthful or not\nPresident Trump said today that lying to Congress would not be acceptable\nBut President Trump does not believe that Kavanaugh lied to Congress he believes in and talking to people at the White House who are working on Kavanaugh's nomination they believe that in Kavanaugh's opening statement that clip that we played earlier where he says\nI drank to access I drank a lot of beer I liked beer and I did things that I look back on and cringe that that\nAlthough it is broad and not specific covers just about everything they say you know he admits to everything except blacking out and when it comes to blacking out that is much more difficult to answer definitively\nResolve is likely to have an impact on the three or so senators who appear to be on the fence\nIt's hard to know a those three Republican senators say that they are waiting for the FBI investigation to come through they keep getting asked in hallways by reporters whether lying matters to them but you know the definition of lying may be different from Chuck Schumer and Democrats who

at Yale\nNPR's Tamara Keith thanks a lot to him You're welcome\nThe political firestorm over Brett Kavanaugh has raised lots of questions about how judicial nominees are evaluated but could lead to changes in the process NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been posing those sorts of questions to lawyers who've been responsible for vetting judges carry joins us now he carried I also\nSo that the judge is already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising that the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nIt's true that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll questions things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually start at age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh happened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but\nThere were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rockets parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC words like what happened at Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown Prep\nIn a time in a speech when he reminisced about a baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours I mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have pointed out the system has adapted in the past for instance in the Nineteen nineties\nQuestions about paying taxes for landscapers and babysitters came up after some nominee right for cabinet positions ran into trouble\nBoys and gray who handle judge nominations for President
