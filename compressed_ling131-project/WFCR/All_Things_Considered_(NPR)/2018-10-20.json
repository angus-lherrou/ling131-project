entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin some on they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible\nHe also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order for this is equipment and various things order from Saudi Arabia for a hundred and fifty

instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop but first you want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she NATO Coby was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely was\nI mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nFor ... you know to do that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were just yeah I bet someone wouldn't you describe those things you might\nNot have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data too\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations and rolling now for August twenty seventh applications at ... dot edu\nDisproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection of being a person of color in black men at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issues as mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and ... story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted of classes and story they needed to be told\nThat's about a ... she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county a sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own
