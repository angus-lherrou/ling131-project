know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it a binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that\nThe Saudis can't do because they can investigate themselves the U.S evidently camp do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe

reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her narrow if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nSounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor ...

including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt was the ads were approached juicy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive

people have given me a hard time like what what do they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was there on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a ... show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nThough when you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan parents are from Mexico\nAnd uh this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and wouldn't eat increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nSounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nDreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and cute little architect of forty year legacy of commitment to community a design celebrating the next generation of leadership a cute little dot com\nOf the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still I asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters you will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric\nAnd there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to resist vote and they said that we were ready to go over there\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools
