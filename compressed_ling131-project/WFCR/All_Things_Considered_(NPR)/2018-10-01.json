extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh the president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background\nCheck of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now three days into the probe NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no Democrats as we've heard complain that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a on this question of senior U.S Senate GPA pointed comments at SUNY Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all those allegations date back to their time\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences and psychology a I ...\nI mentioned this is day three of the FBI's weeklong investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing and those three days so far well\nThe bureau itself has not provided any uh any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI a list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously beyond that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that Julie sweat neck\nA and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course is Kevin us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nIn the last twenty four hours a former friend up Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor in North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin last truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony\nThat it's a something that should be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say NPR's Ryan Lucas thanks trying to get [noise]\nThings

be able to come through so they're gonna have to find some something different than what we've already seen which I think is very unlikely because the FBI is not doing a full on criminal investigation going through DNA and going through sites well\nThen if you think it's unlikely that the investigation will turn up anything worthwhile but the point of the investigation is this just a gesture and now a hollow gesture\nSo the pony investigation seems to be two things one is somebody democratic colleagues who told me their goal at the end of the day is to slow down the nomination all the way

timely that it's not just designed to be able to drag on a week and at the end of it say well now we need another week and now in another week the Anita Hill investigation that with the FBI at that time was three days\nIf the investigation is and be confined to one week uh your colleague in Tyler Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona has said that if the FBI investigation finds that Kavanaugh
