speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track

NPR gotten\nGrad for music and great stories to our\nWherever you get your pie ...\nWho is with the yes on three campaign and Andrew back with legal analyst for the no on three campaign which opposes the measure gentlemen thank you for joining me and to our stock reviews and she helped bring this ballot initiative before a vote is\nYou have said that the issue is not about discrimination per se but about privacy and safety house oh\nThat's right because what this law does is it allows any man at any time to enter a woman's restroom a locker room change facility homeless shelter if they claimed to identify as male the way the laws written is very broad\nNext to impossible to enforce so we're concerned about the privacy issues that that raises on the discrimination level or the Massachusetts commission against discrimination said publicly in two thousand Fifteen as this last being debated that they already have\nThe jurisdiction over public accommodations and gender identity cases so the only legal difference when this law repealed will be that now bathrooms lock rooms places like that will no longer be able to be accessed quite so easily by men of any gender identity including those who could abuse the law to prey on people\nMad wild well first of all I think it's really important for your audience to know that this law about much more than restrooms in locker rooms it's about every place that we go every day to live our lives where they're not be the coffee shop or a restaurant or a\nMovie theater anywhere that's not work school are home and so that's what's really at stake here by repealing this law takes away those protections for transgender people and all those spaces that we all take for granted and so that's why it's so important that people vote yes on three specifically to restrooms I think that Andrew\nIs focusing on something that I think really just haven't materialized and the two years since this law has been in place in fact there has been no uptick in uh incidents of a criminal activity sense of fallen into place\nAnd that's proven by the fact that the Massachusetts chiefs of Police Association more than fifty sexual assault prevention agencies all are in support of upholding this law something tells me that if this law put women and children at risk they would not support this law\nSo if there was a report on a Boston twenty five that in ... was it a target will bring there was a man who tried to get into the stall in a woman's room\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar local ... design at installation helping household secure state or federal incentives and live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nBut that's precisely what type of scenario how does the biological male enter the woman's restroom and not get stopped before he's trying to get into the stalled at ten year old girl that type of scenario that this law allows to happen because it tells\nPeople for example if I was a dead standing outside that bathroom door and I see a man walked into the women through where my daughter is if I Try and stop that man or ... even question them I'm In violation of this law and I could face up to fifty thousand dollars in fines or a year in jail\nSo what this law does is it silences women particular when they object to a male presidents in these intimate spaces\nMatt does this law increase the likelihood that something bad could happen\nAbsolutely not in fact there is a ... study out of the uh University of California law school that says there is no correlation between uptick in a criminal activity when these protections are in place but to the specific case that uh Andrew just brought up I think it's really important for people to know nothing about this law allow anyone to enter that space\nAny criminal activity is still against the law and people will be arrested and charged as they should be\n... when this law was being debated there was an attempt to amend it to prohibit registered sex offenders from making use of this law if they identified as female acclaimed identifies the among the legislature voted that down which means you can have level two and three registered sex offenders\nClaiming a female identity and getting access to women's locker rooms homeless shelters and places like that and if anyone objects again it's the object or the parents mom dad who is subject to criminal penalties that is a bit of a stretch\nA so there are penalties are in the law for sure but that's for repeated acts of discrimination over several years to single out over several years the laws quite clear no one has been fined under this law now in the two years it has taken place up to fifty thousand dollars\nMatt ... how do you lay the concerns of people who are afraid oh just uncomfortable that their safety is going to be threatened well\nFirst of all I Would say we all care about a safety and privacy particularly in restaurants in locker rooms I Would not advocate for a law that put my niece and nephew is at risk and I don't think anyone who's advocating for this law would do that either what the
