want to happen now I'm at least it makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn

McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are the people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the ... the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given\nSo that's the overwhelming sentiment um but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he hats\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and a path university graduate

justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen\nThere is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there
