hotel north Hampton dot com\nPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump into thousands sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought with secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them and they're on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY is Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Dave Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Alice say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of estate me and for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAren't big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that sure\nWe had so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north happen get you're glad rags on

Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you well\nOne of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has to attract an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen\nBut what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars at his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids uh to raise a kid in this atmosphere of this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI or intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together is money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime he's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional and education business health sciences and psychology a icy dot edu the\nPeople's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district on expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations come with strings attached\nAnd so that's how the candidates boats\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system\nYou know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs is huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate\nThe tone still he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country saying vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher in a presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance the voters in this district and everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is drunk doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me Seventy Davis let me ask you about both of us\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded

million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative\nAnd most of it and what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about they might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian Tyler\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\n[noise] uh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd or the next several days and weeks we will look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle your social media and his movements over the last several days\nOh Joan says officers recovered an assault rifle and three hand guns at the same\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences and psychology a icy dot edu\nSort of explosive devices there he says the FBI does not believe at this point uh that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full mode of at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there is no place for hatred of violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady uh he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nAnd can you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime was eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used in in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as ... as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there are there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts for reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiment\nA and the alleged shooter in this case is of course eleven in custody\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second

shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity and that is a message that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fact and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group to her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally during the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this lawyer John cases in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same argument residents ... former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car came up with a structure
