Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete

case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there and I'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church and is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nShould be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed to the installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nSupport Trump and we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's just church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington niche and you're delivering it thirty five fighter just a turkey will

right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with candles reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast\nThe indicator from Planet Money and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to it a new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn\nIs getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got use it in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second\nSo here's to any yours offering a special he'll be a long term storage and his baby holiday party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets no your net [noise]\nIn the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a freak though there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in suits daddy's she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do as well food prices\nKilled is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking growing category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that\nSo here's they get to any your is offering a special treat sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party join us for an evening advancing take health folks taught sex\nAnd sipping some bubbly are aside car in speaking see at the hotel north happened on Saturday December first few clients with an early bird discount before Wednesday our corporate Seventeen\nGrab your tickets no at NPR dot net [noise]\nI'm gonna go get right now [laughter] [noise]\n\nHorn [noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nTo sign up money comes from the transfer live a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries more transfer wise dot com or from their ass [noise]\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there's this naming and shaming and providing details at a level we really haven't seen previously\nNow one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents garden Ira thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nFrom is is that there is no citizen conclusion other than the Russians face was ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nThey released passport photos of names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIt is likely so they would suddenly underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric towler that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling kept\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website there's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through income sightseeing at this military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis is a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person I put a photo shows are boy ...

other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal but tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well but how\nDo they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about ... percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that it's pretty tough to find okay\n[laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed sixth of the

incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out man there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media as she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and myth made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like

attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania\nAnd then bishop ... role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar local ... design at installation

true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two\nFifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nKnow what your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institution\nWhere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think\nThere is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going\nTo or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the

Yogi situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ...\nSo here's a hit to any yours offering a special Korean sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets no and in your net [noise]\n[noise] so how usual is it for the president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending the sad from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis and information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think\nIs very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps substance attacks and

that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support

the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast\nThe indicator from Planet Money and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does and I noticed that the bag of free does have gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got use it in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to\nIncreases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when [noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you know the hotel Northampton offering six meeting at events bases from board room to ballroom with Avi equipment and house catering hotel north Hampton dot com\nFrito there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that's in a bag or Fritos Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a processed food like free does has almost nothing to do with wealth food prices\nKill is a much bigger part of the cost of food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe suspected that shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called ... Sharma demo capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he gave us another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this offering companies a lot of them um because of the parents have gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking going category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now\n[laughter] [noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications that they pass dot edu\n[laughter] that was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nTo find that money comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries more at transfer wise dot com or from their ass [noise]", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Amherst", "day": "12"}
