evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like Tobar on bars they're stretched out ridges

that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape at the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less

vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing

before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels sushi then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think she negotiating a

accepted apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that

that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un bay path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratory science at

smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add American International college offering low residency graduate programs for the working professional in education business health sciences and psychology a icy dot edu that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at

said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one

graduate schools MS in higher education administrator from enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nFeet and allusions diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race it\nNow Harvard says when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering wanted assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but once you and for fair admissions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of

when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to somebody's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things includes race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard\nAnd you are listening to all things considered
