majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we called that mark nice the he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike welcome to the program thanks for having me\nAll right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia\nWhere did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nThat resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp\nAgain but this time they're suing over something that's already passed into state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that dislike disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nIt is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add

accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character you know I can remember hide that my name is

let\nSo you know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to
