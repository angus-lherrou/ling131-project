them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you have actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a

community affected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I
