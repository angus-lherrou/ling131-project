reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year

in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and advocate Halloween is likely to Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual

caricatured\nWell the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missile shows who are not wearing black was because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white piano which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up and black face and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a store called vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually
