talk about what happens on on Wednesday and something that was not paid very much attention to all around the country\nOn first ad Bush's apparent attempt to get into a predominantly black church then going over to kroger's the grocery store\nYes thank you for having us on the show um Wednesday was a very somber day somewhere a little bit for three o'clock I'm all of us was in the office of the mayor's office and I'm One of our colleagues are we heard a scream\nAnd she was on the phone and and she was talking with someone and we really didn't know what had happened at that point\nUm and then as time to continue to proceed we discovered that there was a possibility of a ... there was shooting and it was a possibility there was a family member not really understanding and knowing what had happened uh with ... brand I went out to the location we had several members of our team there\nAnd we later discovered a that Kelly watch the news the cheap equity officer um in metro Denver Louisville metro government or that it was her father\nAh Mari style or who had been murdered\n'em and another loan another woman had been murdered in the parking lot\nI was a horrific day a sad day and we're continuing to grieve through this process\nBut one of the exciting things is that we're very resilient city and we've been working on some things in terms of out of Kelly's office or as the cheap equity officer in terms of looking at these very types of issues [noise]\nWell I I wanted to ask a representative Adam Scott in terms of the the reaction of some public officials are are in the area about whether this was uh\nShouldn't have some public officials are are in the area about whether this was a hate crime or not or could you talk about that and the judgment that people did or didn't go through a very uh soon after this uh this crime occurred\nDefinitely and when something like this happens entire community grieve and his anxious and is stressed out and\nOften look to elected leaders to provide some direction and guidance and in this situation we are as an African American community or failed by many of our elected officials who refused\nTo call this what it was which is a hate crime and when you kill to black people miss Jones and ... and you try to break into a black church that's a hate crime and to have people at the local and state level she use even call it a hate crime sends a message to many of us in community\nThat our lives do not indeed matter to some people and we shouldn't have to beg you to call this what it is\n... we hope to have mayor Greg Fischer on he had to back out late last night but Reverend pension change do you work for the Mayor Tom can you talk about here um can you talk about that and whether there is why the mayor didn't immediately call it a hate crime\nI can share with you the mayor did come out and say that it was a hate crime you talked about the fact that uh the situation was driven by hate when you think about and I have the privilege of past year and a local African American church in ... in the city\nAnd understanding in terms of what the community needs and and then they're hurt that a community goes through and they experienced this\nAnd just recently on yesterday a mayor Greg Fischer and several local pastors and faith leaders in our community sat down and talk with the commonwealth attorney Tom wine and talked about this very issue of a hate crime is horrendous hate crime and\nVery issue of a hate crime is horrendous hate crime and mayor Fischer acknowledged that he had dinner fight with it and he agrees with the community and the families and so he's very aware and very in tune and we've been working on these issues of for the past several years\nAre working with gear or government our lives for racial equity and putting together racial equity plans in terms of our community\nOne of our um tenets in terms of when we think about our community is a very compassionate community\nSo our mayors heart was greed he's anger but also we're going to move into action we've put in action plans and we working with community leaders to begin to look at how this can never happen again in our community how do we avoid these types of things\nAnd so as a community we're very resilient were very focused and we have a plan in place to be able to execute that this won't happen again [noise]\nUh well a representative Scott I Want to see if you are if you agree with the assessment of Reverend James and also if you could talk about this whole issue of the the blue lives matter legislation that went through the\nUh the legislature\nWe have to make sure that um we had on his conversations about what got us here and when we have a political system that passes hateful legislation when we have\nA societal I issues around comments that are made whether you're calling young black kids pumps that dogs or whether you're passing legislation like the blue lives matter building\nAnd changing Kentucky's hate crimes\nLaw to now including your profession what you choose to do or if you are first respond including law enforcement or that sends a clear message across Kentucky about who's last really do matter and then this year passing a so called gang bill that we saw in Mississippi and eight years\nThis year passing a so called gang bill that we saw in Mississippi in the eight years since it's been passed it only black people have received and enhanced sentence from that gang bill to support it and then pass that bill here in Kentucky\nSends a message across our black communities and other communities of color that you are under attack by her own elected officials at the local and state level and we have to have those conversations that say wait a minute what are we doing to make sure that we're looking\nTo restore people to their fullness rather than to incarcerate them so that we can justify building more prisons\nAnd I wanted to I'm correct we had said the St Louis police chief but it's the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers I'm a ... we had said the ... police chief but the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers who\nI'm told the first Baptist church on Sunday that the shooting was motivated by racism was a hate crime um can you talk I'm Reverend James about\nUh the feelings right now and inside the church that Bush apparently tried to get into your the Reverend of another church uh how\nChurches are yelling right now um and also this being\nThe one\nOf a series of attacks this week I mean you have this man allegedly saying\nUm to a white man standing outside with a gun outside kroger's whites don't kill whites like saying don't kill me I'm or he's not going to kill him\nAnd then you have the um letter bombs ... now apparently Fifteen of them sent out to people who are critics of President Trump and then of course the horrific\nUm synagogue a massacre that took place added another place of worship in Pittsburgh the funerals beginning today with the\nUm anti Semitic shooter who\nWent dead on an anti Semitic shooter who also linked um and Jewish groups helping immigrants and his fierce anti immigrant a hatred\nIs is it's it's a very sad time in our country and when we have these types of acts of hatred in our communities and in our churches and synagogues\nAnd mosque when you think about all that has taken place across the country but one of the things\nThat people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come and so one of the things in terms of what we find and what we see as faith leaders ask community leaders\nIs that it is our faith that really drives us beyond and what we see and what we experience to hope\nThat we know that with people coming together and staying together that we can change we have to realize and know that we ... this is not a time to turn on each other but it's a time to turn to each other\nAnd so what I've seen across the faith community talking with all kinds of faith leaders across our city and across this country is the fact that we have a a reality that we have to look at it and confront when we talk about hatred when we talk about the rhetoric that is coming from our ministry ration all these types of things\nThat we as a people of faith have to rise above it and take action you know the reality is is that it it takes us as a people to recognize what is going on and then we have to go to the polls next week is going to be a very critical time\nFor our country that we need to send a message that this type of behavior this type of situation that happened in in Pittsburgh that happened in Louisville is totally unacceptable and we're going to change and the way that you change that is going to the polls and sort of remedy is rising above uh-huh\nRodman James I want to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump\nReverend James I wanted to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump or a after the attack\nOn the synagogue in Pittsburgh said that perhaps armed guards were needed at places of worship or he said similar things after the Parkland shooting that are that are armed guards or the arming of teacher she he ... he suggested must have been under the arming of teachers what's your response to this idea\nThat maybe a houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves\nI don't believe that houses with say our schools need to have armed guards you know that that's not why we attend church we attend church to be able to connect with our God and to be able to realize that our faith protects us and even when challenges come against us\nForm for many of these are extremists orders you to comment on that\nAbsolutely true that social media and online spaces have been become really crucial places for radicalization and but it's also important to realize that these social media platforms are tools that white supremacists are using to try to recruit and radicalized people it's not the sort of hate sort of\nMysteriously blossoming these are organized white supremacist activists\nSort of hatred of mysteriously blossoming these are organized white supremacist activists were trying to exploit platforms and use them to connect with people use them to find new followers and and so\nWe can't look at this was sort of just the abroad problem of how do we fix social media how do we fix Instagram how to fix Twitter I think it's important to really narrow the question and say I'm Twitter Instagram Facebook are being exploited by hostile actors and by terrorists\nTo recruit people who will commit violence how do we focused on that particular problem and how do we how do these companies take particular responsibility for white supremacist terror and how those terrorists are using their platforms\nThe Robert ... hours account on ... breed posted another user who wrote open your eyes it's the filthy evil Jews bringing the filthy evil Muslims into the country um\nIf you can talk about um his link Bowers link a white supremacist link\nBetween Jews and Jewish groups were about to speak to representative of highest he particularly focused on this issue\nThat a refugee I'm I'm resettlement organization was bringing what he called the invaders and I'm a Brian ... of CNN just looked at um a Fox News and other right wing outlets and saying the level of\nUm times that they are talking about invaders just in the last few weeks has so escalated\nAnd Bowers himself said I like the way they're changing the language of aliens illegal aliens to invaders and it's this link of immigration as President Trump now even if she goes to Pittsburgh tries to divert attention\nAnd as President Trump now even if she goes to Pittsburgh tries to divert attention to the border sending saying he's sending the fifty two hundred soldiers to the border shown on the border there'll be more soldiers than in Iraq and Afghanistan\nOn sending more than fifty two hundred um soldiers to the border um and also saying he plans to through executive order and the birthright citizenship\nI mean you're\nPulling all of these incredibly troubling threads together and it's really important to recognize that the attack of on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh was an attack on Jewish people and\nThe ... areas of the people who died are just heart wrenching but an attack on Jewish people for supporting refugees an attack specifically targeted at an organization that was helping a has a she bought ceremonies in honor of supporting refugees and\nAnd drawing on the Jewish history of persecution or\nEmphasize how important it is that people who are fleeing violence in terror elsewhere in the world that we have the capacity to welcome them and give them a safe place them that that is a moral duty ...\nAnd in talking to a representative for highest the particular a refugee organization and that the shooter named and that he said if you will to his rage that he shared a link\nTo a synagogue that were hosting these kinds of events you know she said that there are still wrestling with what it means to be targeted with violence particularly for fighting for this basic humanity for treating other people with basic humanity and that is what is so incredibly tragic here uh\nThat this congregation and these people were targeted at because of their humanitarian impulses because of support for Jews for refugees for people of color\nFor refugees for people of color\nWas over Wyoming\nWill do the Anti Defamation league has found that anti Semitic incidents in the U.S rose by fifty seven percent in two thousand Seventeen the largest single year increased\nSince it started recording such statistics\nI'm Wondering if you or your strength and this is of course not an isolated situation here in the United states so there's been a rise in anti Semitic incidents across Europe as well uh I'm Wondering if you could uh uh uh talk about the context in which is is a current as more and more\nOf a right wing governments are coming to power all across the industrial world and even in in many parts of Asia and Latin America as well\nSo obviously the context of rising anti Semitism is very disturbing\nAnd what was particularly striking about Robert Bowers the Pittsburgh shooter is it and looking at his on line a profile on gap and the post that he made it was clear that he was channeling a lot of very ancient anti Semitism but a lot of the ropes and the hatred that he was sharing a\nAre very are centuries old but this is not a new phenomenon and the anti Semitic violence\nAnd it's a very old and a very dangerous ideology but Robert powers was also someone\nWho was actively in communication with other white supremacists someone who was very familiar with the events of Charlottesville where white supremacist groups marched through university town with torches Santa chanting Jews will not replace us\nAnd some of the statements that he made on his account suggests that he was familiar with those debates about what people who are white supremacy in America should do the optics and different kinds of action what's going to be most effective\nUh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs\nThe kinds of action what's going to be most effective uh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs again this belief in an all white country that the United states is only a country for white people that other people should be shut out or don't belong here or shouldn't be allowed to have citizenship\nSo that you saw him on this platform interacting including interacting with other white supremacist activist I spoke to one activist who's an anti fascist from Charlottesville who says that she constantly monitors gab\nFor the harassment of white supremacists and she actually got some of these Robert Bauer posts um but they she passed them by she saw them she had screen shots of a couple of them but the kind of hatred that he was doing was silk comment on this platform that there were so many dozens and hundreds of men sharing equally extreme\nRacist propaganda that nothing about what he had said has stood out to her\nThat this was someone who had apparently harassed her directly directly is I'm a massage in his ticket nasty comments and then appear to go on to commit mass murder at a Jewish synagogue and she said she's still wrestling with it because what he said on that platform the kind of hate that he was expressing was so common\nThat it didn't stand out it didn't seem exceptional\nBurden I or do do do a speaking I'm about what happened on Saturday ah the synagogue attacked the darkest days Pittsburgh's history but said armed guards are not the solution\nSeems to be a place that we need to be looking at is how we choose the guns which is the common denominator is every mass shootings in America ... grocery truth drew murder\nSo that's there to do he also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh\nYou also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh but they are busy burying the dead this is President Trump right after the massacre talking about armed guards\nProduction in size of the results would have been\nLoser will always or social spread but\nSome kind of a production moves to jump all\nMaybe you should have been very much difference to Georgia\nHe was able to do things for for Jewish or the will to do it here the boys were outstanding players of pollution in front of a job but as you know\nNumerous solutions and we're just\nSo that was President Trump calling for armed guards in the synagogues um\nLowest Beckett if you could talk about this and also I mean as we're talking about this violence you have\nUm grad Bush or in the Louisville area and Jefferson town I she has a numerous weapons are not clear whether he had some legally he had to hand them over because of his violent background again so often we see the links to domestic violence in their past\nBut why these men are able to have these guns course Bowers used in a are Fifteen\nThese Lincoln just to violence and in this might you might think of as a stretch but because you are a guardian reporter I'm thinking about your colleague Ben Jacobs um who is body slammed by the Montana Congress member to plead guilty to criminal assaults and why I'm bringing that up now is President Trump just last\nWeek on held a rally in Montana where he applauded a June fourth day for bodies slamming your colleague at\nA June fourth day for bodies slamming your colleague at\nThe guardian this in the midst of\nUm uh the investigation into the murder of a drum all ... with President Trump taking the side of the Saudi a leadership and not to mention the CNN mail bombs and President Trump has not stop attacking the media all week", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!",
