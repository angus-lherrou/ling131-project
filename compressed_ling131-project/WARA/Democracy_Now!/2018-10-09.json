can you talk about what took place on Sunday and the significance of both an hour is not\nOutright victory he still has the runoff but he got many more votes than what's expected\nYeah so that's a very dangerous situation in Brazil that I think is very important to monitor because that could have an effect in the whole region um\nLike I said before a former president Lula actually or if he was able to run he would probably win very easily but there was a vacuum created because um he was put in jail or with charges of receiving a bribe but actually that is no\nEvidence that he received the bribe\nSo since the ... the parliamentary cool against president Dilma Rousseff to leaders and go we are in this situation of limbo with cannot come see that that we have a democracy in Brazil right now\nAnd uh so both on that or is there was out of a series of attacks on democracy that started two years ago when the parliament the record against him or herself\nJemma Seth hum is who'd out or she is forced out of the presidency and then um Lula who is the food decided to run for president is in person\nI'm ... who is the fruit decided to run for president is impressed and\nExactly yeah I Wish that that there was a cool because that was no effort now that's typical muted any crimes\nAnd but she wasn't the it's the anyway and both ... and I do at that time voted a as a Congress member voter for the ... in the name of the person who ports for her during the military dictatorship\nOnce where do you mean he ... in teaching support in the impeachment in his honor\nYes because during the votes in Congress most Congress members of ordering the name of God in the name of the family and both so NATO voted in the name of the person who reports for ... during\nThe day that they don't want to go to Jim Crow south I interviewed her in April here she was ousted in two thousand sixteen and what she's described as a co and I asked her about the rise of the far right\nWill see do far too yes I can indies the far right in Brazil like the fluoride everywhere it's anti ... anti black anti indigenous person and it is in favor of ending all over sites and they struggle with is the one to end any oversight of labor work situations\nAnd the longest to slavery that continue to exist in Brazil is full of prejudice and intolerance use and they believe that they can resolve the most complex problems\nUsing brute force of violence result in violence what's happened in the vote in the impeachment process that I suffered legislative balls and narrow cast his vote to paying tribute to the military dictatorship\nAnd torture and torture whose name was Carlos ... to ... to\n... voyage he paid tribute to this man who was\nSeeing all of the processes of truth and justice that unfolded in Brazil he said the following to pay tribute to someone who brought Tara to president Dilma Rousseff person who is capable of doing an impeachment proceeding\nTo justifies voted in this manner is a person who sells hatred he's spreads hatred because he only understands one language the language of violence\nThat's dealing with chef the former Brazilian precedent tuition peach I was speaking to her when she was at University of California Berkeley and many of the way some men don't say she describes both NATO if you can talk more about both not us history and what exactly he represents\nYeah have represents a a a set the ... the military and that's a\nIt's openly fascist like I said before it talks about raping women openly\nHas said that he'd rather have a dance than than on gay son they praising the military dictatorship his his head than he would\nGive a a\nA ... a\n... shouldn't be free to kill so it's a\nVery go to him and his own words of a two thousand Thirteen interview with then while he was congressmen ... on BBC\nAnd throwing out some way to go to I went to the battle with the gays because the government proposed anti homophobia classes for the junior grades knew\nThey wanted us to do with the actor we stimulate homosexuality and children from six years old this is not normal\nLost your culture is different to ours we're not ready for all of this Brazil has no father would ever take pride in your case on pride happiness celebrate if his son turns out gay no way\nSo if it turns okay no way\nThat they are both in the front runner in Brazil also as you said said I'm told a congresswoman Chu was too ugly to rate\nThe exact and yeah so yeah we what happens now is that is a lot of a media manipulation\nA scenes thing pitchmen of president ... years ago that is constant attacks song that the tea on the workers' party a\nIt was almost like all mainstream meeting or is it was like Fox News that is no alternative and uh also now during the campaign I'm both an avid starts at a ... a company of fake news especially on what's sad that it's not controlled\nFor example Facebook has a closed several accounts that were spreading fake news and dance for ... in against a candidate for vice president ... uh\nSo you know also Steve Bannon is one of them be advisors for both on that so that is a lot of misinformation and manipulation\nIn August ... posted a photo on Twitter of him with former Trump strategist Steve Bannon\nEduardo ... auto wrote quote it was a pleasure to meet Steve Bannon strategist in Donald Trump's presidential campaign we had a great conversation and we share the same worldview and we're certainly in touch to join forces especially against cultural Marxism and the significance of what Edward o himself Joe your son\nYes exactly and uh\nWell I think that they'd solves things for them to understand that to the meeting Brazil was portraying for them but that said the progressive candidate as far left but when he was the mayor of some follow actually what he did the was a he\nHe was the mayor of some follow actually what he did was uh\nHe built a several daycares and more than thirty hospitals and uh he tried to make the traffic and to see the batter\nFor example have the infrastructure for bikes\nWhen he was a ministry of education under the Lula administration is he created more than a chain new federal university is more than three hound during new um campuses university campuses and there was much more um incentive and a\nFellow ships for ah education at all levels so you know he comes from an educational backgrounds\nAnd that it's a you know he doesn't come from any type of uh extreme laughed background and so what what we have now is a very extreme fascist candidates\nRunning against a moderate candidates that are in our hope now is that to treat all the candidates progressive candidates have said then they would support and under dads and now in the runoff elections in a few weeks so hopefully the known between now and then uh\nThey think you're going to make up the difference and then the run off\nI think so because those progressive punted this to gather will probably get about twenty percent of the votes and ah if they are able to convince people that that this is a dangerous path and that the challenge is how do we\nDeal with ... and not just mainstream media but the ... the manipulation of social media\nI wanted to go to Noam Chomsky who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... ...\nTrump ski who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... in prison and when he came out a Chomsky condemned Brazil's right wing media\nSo can you talk about what the us is facing right now this monster hurricane hitting the panhandle if you look at um ...\nWeather reports and the networks are you know at the time like this increasingly take up more and more news time either weather reports because whether we're talking about wildfires in California or the monster storms\nOr in the Carolinas and now possibly hitting Florida and Alabama\nStir storms or in the Carolinas and now possibly hitting Florida and Alabama Alabama it's the whole state has been called the state of emergency um\n... there is\nAlmost no mention by meteorologists and I'm not talking even Fox I'm Talking MSNBC and CNN CNN of the connection between these increasingly violent storms and climate change is there one and can you explain it\nWhether it's certainly is a connection and what we what we haven't done ... into the atmosphere is what made the atmosphere warmer in other words you put a lot more energy in the atmosphere\nThat energy move play out in terms of a whole suite of different more extreme weather conditions that whether this particular publication is um it's caused by climate change is impossible to say ... is often the cases that we are exhausted by to increasing the the power in these how Africans in these extreme weather events\nOn the ... what we call the funds that was actually a beautician\nWhere we're trying to say is this event a climate change if we're getting better with the understanding that uncertainty of his quarterly loss of evidence now this year that some of them will recent severe weather conditions were saying how being seriously exacerbated by the additional warming we're putting the atmosphere from a burning of fossil fuels and the release of calm dogs on\nThe wall so I Can't comment on this particular topic and it's like this how it can was caused by climate change\nOr you know the severity of is how we can and this is a very through some of the other events that we've seen in recent years certainly um has been exacerbated by issues of climate change by a burning of fossil fuels\n... enemy joined this should be making that clear link when they make them into discussing these issues and during during the weather forecast within the u._s.\nYou talk about what's needed professor Anderson the report says there's no documented his star precedent for the scale of changes required um ...\nPrecedent for the scale of change as required um you have talked about a Marshall Plan what do you mean a new Marshall Plan\n... well the Marshall Plan was the um the the to deliberate strategy after the second World War to trying to reconstruct Europe after being nosy very severely bones and destroyed\nAnd both institutionally but mostly physically during the war so I'm saying that that is probably the newest metaphor analogy we have a scale of challenge that we should be face\nTo the compromise to shift away from the fossil fuel based energy system to zero carbon energy system and to do that within within the wealthy parts of the world really within about two decades I'm probably three or four enough that guy with a slightly poorer parts of the world so we're not going to do that through\nA small price mechanisms through just tweaking the market is going to be ...\nTo change it intervention by government to make the necessary rates of change now that sounds initially very I'm very challenging and suddenly will be but I think there was also ...\nAnd there was a positive narrative behind this and that this this transition this transformation to zero Kelvin and uses them will come with some job opportunities are long term secure job opportunities\nNot just in building a low carbon power stations but in the massive electrification program that will be necessary\nIn retrofitting in other words making our existing building infrastructure which when we'll still be using for the next twenty thirty forty years to make that building infrastructure is suitable for the twenty first century so he require much less anything it was a cool it\nAnd and this is a safer environment to be in the climate continues to change which is undoubtedly will um ... even if we stopped emissions today what we're seeing some ongoing climate change\nYou have criticized the eyepiece stay safe for us\nClimate change\nYou have criticized the I. P. C. C. four constraining its policy advice to fit neatly within the current economic model can you explain I mean for some kind of a landmark report like this is simply critical because we live in a country in the United states where the president proudly\nDeny its climate change you know calls it a client at Chinese hoax\nOn and so had any kind of report like this but you were a critic of the report in some respects\nCertainly well so I think is a really good report and joined to understand the impacts between one point five and two degrees centigrade of warming when it comes to what we have to do about it I think again it it runs skate a really being very honest\nAnd given that how it is effectively a scientific report I think our role with a scientist as academics is to\nTell it like it is not to color it's all sweetened the pill to make it more attractive to\nMy comments have all but I mean it's not just for this report Ajmi repeatedly come up with the PC to was way coin direct and honest about the impact side when it comes to what we have to do about it we ... we don't want to scare the politicians or the public we don't want to um\nMove away from the store the energy systems that we have today so we always try to bully bullies massage the status quo incremental changes if you're like what I'm saying is that actually when you really look at the numbers behind the report look at the numbers the science comes out with then we're talking about\nA complete revolution and the energy system and that is going to be very fundamental questions about how we run our economies\nAnd again you can to him I said well not seen as just as you know ... to ... to remove the current economic system we have we have to remember so many being was ten years now since the banking crisis and many parts of the world are still suffering the repercussions without finding cautious to the current economic framework has struggled\nSuffering the repercussions of that ... to the current economic framework has struggled and within his own remiss if you like do I think this has been a real opportunity which will not losing to reshape the economy there was an economy that suitable for society not sound like the suitable for the economy\nAnd I think the policy make the academics I'm just runs scared of this\nOf being honest about ... on numbers tell us\nAbout the rates of change that we will we require and how we have to move\nThe productive capacity of our society from building second homes for professors or private jet so private your so large four wheel drive cars moving from that to building public transport electrification improved homes but everyone does it just shifted that productive capacity the resources and the labor\nFrom the if you like the luxury for the twenty percent\nTo be essential low carbon infrastructure order this\nDr Anderson the effect of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement we just had a segment on Brazil the front runner ... who are gas called uh open fascist a extremely far right wing candidate\nUm has promised um that he will pull out of the Paris Agreement as well and would abolish Brazil's ministry of environment\nOr which environmentalist fairly late to deforestation has the Amazon your thoughts on both both NATO and Trump\nWell there are\nPlenty from a scientific perspective and I would always argue probably from mold perspective they all completely 'em out to chew with walked on now says is saying\nOh it was so we have to be very careful when we see these extreme figures on both of these I think of a sudden the extreme figures we have to remember the day off a little bit of noise on the system the the the the general trend line is more recognition to climate change is a serious issue even the poll data in the states shows they so I'm not seeing like different Brazil so I'm not sure\nBut we so we are seeing climate change advancing people\nSo I'm not seeing like different Brazil so I'm not sure but so we are seeing climate change advancing people off thinking this is an important issue\nBecause some of 'em I'm not always the brightest people who are leading our country's I'm kind of understand that all the things that they have a political fights they have to appeal to who doesn't do not want to hear that message\nAnd I think the rest of us should not scared of them we just have to double redouble our efforts and then the wing and President Trump decided to put out the Paris Agreement which of course he can't do it anyway but has plans to and the Chinese and the French step forward and say well we will try and do some make some extra effort to compensate\nAnd we also said the U.S many ... sang the climate change is still an important issue\nTo the U.S has nothing to do is not a dictatorship ... cannot take tight ... population of the U.S and it's going to do of course ... both an uneasy influential but so all the ... so it is incumbent on the rest of us there were more informed by the science and I would argue with a more reasoned mode and progressive or by groundswell analysis\nAnd it's up to us to wind up all our efforts and make sure that we move and the right direction and not to run the scared\nOf of the Trump service well there are plenty of them they will come and they will go but the overall issue of climate change the physics of climate change is here to stay regardless of the time frame who wins over the occasional presidents\nAnd in the last minute what\nDoes the future look like a how bad can and things get if we proceed on this course\n\nOf the way things are going at the moment I think it is quite reasonable to think we're heading about four degrees centigrade warming across the century that would be off the devastating just remember the difference between now and an ice ages about five degrees\nSo we're talking about changes that would normally occur over probably tens of thousands of years a little more than a hundred years and and the Hundred Years' in some respects sounds like a long time but many of the people listened to this\nIs and and the Hundred Years' in some respects sounds like a long time but many of the people listening to this that children will still be alive and hundred years and certainly the grandchildren will be on the news is just to move I really and so many respects and when
