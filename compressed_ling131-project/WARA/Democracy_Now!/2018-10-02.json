if they had any information about any sexual assaults possibly committed by the Supreme Court nominee ... joining us by phone from the Washington DC area\nBill welcome to democracy now can you talk about why you started this petition and how many people have signed on so far\nUh yeah I was um we were first moved to to do this um because we felt that it was stunning to me that we as a community I Believe\nNo so much about what was going on during the eighties and the ... party culture um and that there were many graduates with the class of eighty three who were close to Brett\nBut who have not shown their faces they've not they've not spoken out about what was going on either in his defense or a doctor for defense um and so I I was stunned by that violence than felt we have to try to do something to\nTo shake my classmates and my schoolmates up and get them to think this is an opportunity for you to do the right thing and if it if if our little position in our drive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something that I I feel it's been a success\nDrive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something that I I feel it's been a success\nAnd ... are you were a freshman all when Brett Kavanaugh was a senior at their school or did you uh how well did you know him and when you were to saw the testimony how does that jibe with your recollections of what he was like\nWell I didn't know Brett personally and I think it's important to note that I I don't consider myself a witness in this case in any way shape or form again I was a freshman and he was a senior he was a very big personality on campus he was a I'm a\nFootball player he was kept on the basketball team it was hard in a roughly four hundred person school not to know who the real social leaders were um even as a freshman um\nSo I knew him and his crew more by reputation than personal observation um however it just struck me during his testimony that given what I Know about perhaps party culture in the eighties um and knowing that he\nBragged openly on his ... page about his participation in that party culture\nThat he would rule out categorically the possibility that something untoward or downright illegal could have happened when he was under the influence of alcohol and that just felt wrong to me and um I I Know that there are\nThere must be people who are closer to him closer in age enclosure and in social commitment ... that have to know more about what was going on and I think we've been seeing that from his classmates and I would like to see that from his\nPrep class in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that had masters from seven prestigious Washington DC area private schools including yours Georgetown prepping Kavanaugh's at St ladder to warn parents had a party culture among their children\nHad sent a letter to warn parents about a party culture among their children which included heavy drinking leading to quote sexual or violent behavior\nThe article quotes headmaster at Holton arms saying quote a number of parents and kids have expressed dismay over some of the situations that we can parties were concerned about the potential for tragedy\nAbout can you respond to that on yeah I unfortunately\nIt wasn't a millionaire with that article when it was printed in in Nineteen Ninety I that was when I was graduating from college but what I read yesterday when it was first forwarded to me I'm\nShocked me in in some way because it was an acknowledgement on the part of the administrations of the schools that we all went to that there was a severe problem and it was a severe problem um but what is what a shocking and upsetting to me is that as I understand it not much institutionally\nHas been done to really put a stop to it and I know that there is a very very steep hill to climb for educators in managing teenage kids um I Know that as as a parent of a teenager myself my son's Seventeen um it's not easy for parents to get involved but I just feel like\nWow that was a long time ago and we're still fighting the same battle with underage drinking and drug use with um a a a culture of party culture that seems to be accepting of\nIllegal behavior and dangerous behavior\nUm and I just wish that there was something more that that we could have done and the the twenty eight years plus that had transpired since um since that letter came out\nYou have a close to Seventy names on this letter that you knew issue what do you hope to do with with it and what are you a hope are all the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names\nAll the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names are\nWell it's it's closer to a hundred now actually didn't look at the number of this morning I should have it's it's been growing since I'm we release it on Saturday which um is probably a tricky day to try to get people to pay attention to it but since we started to get some news coverage on it I'm a we've been getting more and more signatories um and we've been very judicious with uh how we're going to proceed because\nThere are a number of folks who signed who for various reasons such as they are employed by the federal government\nCan't have their names released publicly um but did they did find it in that they wanted to indicate support so we're having to be very thoughtful and we're contacting everyone individually to make sure that they are aware that we intend to go public with their name make sure that they are they say they are and that we didn't end up with some fall centuries [noise]\n[noise] um but the concern that I have right now is that I'm not all that sure how interested the FBI is in our list um they have their hands full and that's what is so\nUrgent about the situation to me is a week is not very much time for the FBI to conduct a very thorough investigation um they have to\nIdentify locate an interview a lot of people if they really want to get to the bottom of this um so they may have their hands full which leads me to believe that the press um maybe a more\nA effective way to get the word out and to get our letter to see the light of day and for then\nFellow prop alumni to take the action of saying you know what I Do have a story and I do think it's important that it'd be heard [noise]\nI'm barb oh you said in an interview with the Washingtonian consent is a concept did not even exist it was not in our lexicon at Georgetown ...\nExplain well I\nOur lexicon at Georgetown ...\nExplain\nI feel culturally it's important to recognize that the eighties we're a very different time and place for the country at large I'm not just in in private schools private boys' schools um everywhere\nWe weren't talking a whole lot about the sexual dynamic between boys and girls at the high school level it just wasn't part of the conversation when you compound that by\nHaving an all boys private school that's Catholic um the likelihood of meaningful conversations between administrators between parents and kids I'm coming up to try to recognize the fact that\nBeen adequate investigation and judge Kavanaugh's testimony at the hearing lead us to doubt judge Kavanaugh's fitness to serve and an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAs a nonpartisan organization the ACLU does not oppose judge cabinet are based on predictions about how he would vote as a justice we oppose him in light of the credible allegations of sexual assault against him on\nHeels of the announcement the ACLU launched a million dollar ad campaign across four states\nIf you launched a million dollar ad campaign across four states urging key swing votes senators to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation said targets Colorado Republican Sen Cory Gardner\nWe've seen this before denials from our firm in\nTheir\nLives she lives in\nA categorical on a naive you know should we do ...\nAmerica is watching and as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court integrity matters and we cannot have any doubt\nSenator Gardner posed the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nSimilar ACLU as a dress Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer West Virginia's Joe mansion and Shelley Moore Capito interestingly she went to a whole an arms as Dr Ford\nUh Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and senator Dan Sullivan urging them to vote no on Kavanaugh\nThe last time the ACLU publicly opposed a Supreme Court nominee was over a decade ago in two thousand six when George W. Bush nominated Justice Samuel Alito\nIn Nineteen eighty seven the ACLU opposed president Ronald Reagan's nomination of justice Robert Bork and in Seventy one at a police president Richard Nixon's domination of justice William Rehnquist\nWell for more we're joined by Louis smelling deputy legal director at the ACLU and director of the center for liberty which encompasses the ACLU is work on reproductive freedom women's rights lesbian gay bisexual transgender rights freedom of religion and belief and disability rights welcome to democracy now the ways so talk about the change of heart we just had David Cole on\nWhen the Kavanaugh noun Smith was made he said we cannot take a stand up\nSo um I Would say in brief extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures as as you talked about before\nI Would say and brief extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures as as you talked about before we didn't have post judge Kavanaugh when he was first nominated we didn't pose as the proceedings went forward we issued a report talking about his record we raise concerns about his civil liberties record in certain areas\nBut but we adhere to our long standing policy but now in light of the sexual assault allegations we have come out to a post judge Kavanaugh believing that those raise serious questions that are fundamentally different they were serious questions about the integrity of the court should he be non should he be on the court\nWhat are the well I'm a point to the code of judicial conduct the cutter judicial conduct talks about the importance of a judge behaving in a way that inspires public confidence in the integrity and the impartiality of of the court\nAnd when we look at judge Kavanaugh's record in these proceedings or what's come out he's not behaving in a manner that will\nAdvance the public confidence in the integrity I Would point to we have credible allegations of sexual assault\nWe have a judge who has resisted calling for a full investigation what we would think of as\nAs central to any any fair proceedings and we have a judge who now in the hearings last Thursday talk to about the allegations as a political hit and as a political hit in response to pay back I Believe was his word for Trump and for Clinton that's\nThat that speaks more of a partisan than a judicial temperament\nAre ones that are asked about that because\nThe hearing was really stunning in terms of the the damages the judge government do to himself and his testimony in terms of the belligerence\nA show to the members of the Senate and also the um the lack of would you buy or judicial restraint though in the way you approached the questions that we're talking about him I'm Wondering to what degree those years really galvanized\nThe questions that we're talking about him I'm Wondering to what degree those hearings really galvanized the on the board or to make this decision the show you\nOn the board was was considering seriously the allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape the board met after the hearing so that the board could have a chance to hear the witnesses as such as we had it\nUm we like others of share concerns about what kinds of investigation there is how robust the hearing is and whether there's a fair chance for both of them to tell their stories robustly um and in light of of the allegations and as Susan Herman statement says in light of the allegations in light of the hearings we came out to oppose\nAnd a decision to launch an ad campaign in the same time\nWell the decision to launch that campaign of course followed the board's position the boards those that we would oppose but now that we are opposing it's incredibly important that we stand up it's incredibly important that we stand up because of the message\nThat the any confirmation of judge Kavanaugh would send to sexual assault survivors it's important that we stand up given what this would say about the integrity of the ... I Can't\nReiterate enough how important it is that we believe in our in our systems into believing the court requires us to believe that people are being human or working as hard as they can to be impartial unfair\nSo let's go to a judge Brett Kavanaugh is giving his opening statement Thursday\nThis whole effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked\nAbout more judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nFish is a circus and talked about the Clinton conspiracy is\nThis is a circus\nAnd talked about the Clinton conspiracy et cetera the million spent ... left wing groups he talked about left wing conspiracies his rage was almost an contained now does this mean that progressive groups that go the before the Supreme Court should ask\nHim to recuse himself I mean the fact that matters right wing groups have also spent millions of dollars she has not raising that\n[noise] um I think I Would lead to another day questions are for a cute little but I Will say that we had a lot of conversation about it we the public can and discourse around nominations about how they become so partisan what we saw here was the nominee himself engaging in in partisan conduct and I think your question\nOf course raises for us I'm a serious question about how well the public perceives a decision that comes out against a group like Planned Parenthood the N. double ACP for example groups that have been opposing cabinet how will how will we assess the fairness and stand by the fairness of a decision\nThat affects you know quote democratic opponents close quote that might run to political gerrymandering our campaign finance or the census again this is about\nHow important it is for judges to really conduct themselves in a way that gives us confidence that they're doing everything they can to be impartial as they hear cases before the\nWar to nursery NBC News is reporting that there are some text messages a suggestive recover and I reached out to a ...\nTo try to refute Deborah Ramirez is sexual assault ... before it became public are there any ... if that's true and it concerns there about his conduct a leading up to the hearings\nI certainly think you know that\nIt's incredibly important that we have had a here that we have a hearing and that we have a full investigation and a full investigation seems important both for the integrity\nDuring that we have a full investigation and a full investigation seems important both for the integrity of the opportunity for judge Kavanaugh to clear his name should that be the case\nFor Dr Blasey Ford's allegations to be robustly hurt and tested and for the public to have confidence confidence in Canada is our as I said this is too important we can have no doubt\nSo it's important for an investigation an investigation to look for the facts and to test the veracity of of the statements that have made\nI wanted to switch the gear in the last\nMinute we have with you and that is the ACLU involvement with the migrant children should the New York times reporting the Trump Administration\nHas begun transferring detained migrant children from shelters across the country to a barren tent city in West Texas the times reports hundreds of children being sent each week from shelters to the center city which currently houses sixteen hundred children ... he reportedly as new school children have limited\nAccess to legal services the U.
