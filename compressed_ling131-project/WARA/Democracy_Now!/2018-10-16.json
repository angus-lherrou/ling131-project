register or the voter registration rolls\nAnd exact match is exactly as pernicious and malicious as a Stacey Abrams has has said as the courts have said because what it does is it looks at minor things so\nIf you've got a hyphen and your name when you filled out your voter registration card but you are say your driver's license doesn't have the hyphen their Garcia Marquez\nWas a high ... Garcia Marquez without the hyphen then that registration is kicked out and it's put in this kind of limbo status and because\nUm things like a a hyphen or accent mark or a Y. instead of an eye those kinds of things immediately began to go after the names um for African Americans\nFor Hispanics and for Asians this is why you're seeing that kind of dissed proportional disproportionate um\nElimination of these registration cards it's it's it's as pernicious as Kris Kobach cross check\nThis whole issue of having one of the candidates for the she also be in charge of oversee the election process uh could you talk about that as well\nYes and so I imagine this year you're playing a game where you're trying to win but you're also the referee and so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody wouldn't look at that\nAnd so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is cute\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity wouldn't require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nWe had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making\nIs what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question legitimacy of our electoral process seats and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian kept the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor ... Sunday my opponent is unapologetically extreme she's banking on illegal immigrants to secure a victory for her at the ballot box professor oh\nAnd and so that is campus so much like Kris Kobach out of Kansas I'm you know Kobach has been writing that lie of um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing\nOf um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing the elections in Kansas and only he can block them\nAnd so and by raising the flag of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that's in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note stay the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian camp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nA and cause you talk about the impact on voter turnout or more of a sudden or either closings of all places or shifting a ... vote in places from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County the hold her decision in twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixteen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it\nA hundred and sixty a polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian ...\nBowling places where shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian camp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling place as being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations will when they consolidated the polling stations\nThe one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states so for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to the press the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery Ken\nUnfortunately built a very strong record a voter suppression\nYes he and I have to leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore it\nWell I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating a forcing him to restore the cancel registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary can end with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or form of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp and Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp poop Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student try to ask him about his endorsement\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate Robert started going to want to jump in when\nSenator Purdue return the phone after the student demanded it back\nOn Sunday produce office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him I'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on this and as we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who's voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place but what's happening in Georgia\nSo first on I'm senator ... do you know remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast says I'm by praying for Obama's\nOne of those Christian breakfast is um by praying for Obama's death\nBy saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song\nAnd you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue um and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian Kemp and Casey cable has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety\n[laughter] I think it was during the time of Moses well no actually the last time I voted live when I was serving in the military and that's been quite a number of years\nI'm so that you know it it it's an act that now I I think I treasure even more than I did back then and that's something I'm looking forward to do you know I mean we have citizens or across this great state of ours who have made mistakes in the past and they have had pets\nAcross this great state of ours who have made mistakes in the past and they have have paid their debt and this is a country that really believe that when a dead as fate is what is paid and it's time for us to move on and experience what being a citizen is all about and there's no greater expressing the net then being able to vote\nAnd I wanted to turn to a map of the country on and talk about it with\nThe states to states in the country which everyone including people with felony convictions are allowed to vote Maine and Vermont you can vote from jail\nI'm In ... states Florida Virginia or Kentucky in Iowa all people with felony convictions or permanently disenfranchised Florida has the highest number as has been said if a disenfranchised voters one point four million adults in the state can't vote\nOr because of having a felony conviction sent me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes and enjoys bipartisan support we're not leading where the partisan nature of\nUh of this topic or or the issue of voting what we're leading with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that selling disenfranchisement now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that\nAnd have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign that we haven't brace and we own onto\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity and because of that we've been able to get people\nThat that that that that throw off their parties and clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other knowing that once the debt is paid it's paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice\nAnd for the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing hair I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discord\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAre able to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a a scene a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the ...\nIt's a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican challenger Kevin Cramer or the race is expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nYeah so the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that but there's probably civically written to not allow\nPO box is count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I D and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost Heidi Heitkamp percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group\nSo that so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as a Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas named Pocahontas as a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\nOn that say she has Native American lineage and ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the twenty twenty presidential election\nWill just imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her as history is all the barriers that are being faced by Native Americans in this country and you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchised thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to go with this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAnd they are and what are the two in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly the Florida referendum or whatever happens there will\nElections clearly the Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next elections but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I have a have these folks have their rights a vote before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there was a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very important people know that they can vote in North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have\nBasically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm a truly worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different and twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWe want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of
