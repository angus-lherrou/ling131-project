Thirteen twenty am ... welcome to old time radio showcase the show where we play classic programs from the golden age of radio for both out of the show tonight\nWill be showcasing radio adventure programs up versus an episode of the ... show Clyde baby was a famous\nLion tamer an animal trainer he also became a circus impresario who owns his own show that later merged with a cold brothers circus to\nForm that Clyde Beatty coal brothers circus he was also the Starbucks syndicated radio series the ... show from Nineteen fifty to Nineteen fifty to the weekly radio show featured adventurous loosely based on his real life exploits tonight's episode crisis on the set\nWas originally broadcasts on march nice of Nineteen fifty\nEnjoying the show they show [noise]\nAnd then with all the next kickoff Justin Cody brought it back eighty nine yards on the return only broke one tackle and then it was just the sheer speed\nIt came right up the middle on that and he's the first guy always has the most difficult to get into a shot on him and even though he's small he's explosive\nAnd he runs through tackles all the time he broke that was actually out race everybody that was a\nIt really brought a sigh of relief adult broke from that moment on settled down yeah it really played well and in that first Dr bike was very frustrated because Franklin is using unbelievably wide splits in the office of law and they had a bit of a disagreement how the out of her her diva\nWe will be wide splits in the office of line and he had a bit of a disagreement how the out of her her deep as who's handling just\nOnce again having coach for a long time if you're going to give me that gap yeah I'm going to make sure I have a defensive tackle and I put them on the outside of the center on the inside hip but the guard going into forty five degree angle they're snapping the ball they don't have a quarter back on the Senate yeah that certainly you I mean you're going to [noise]\nI just don't know how you block but anyhow we we don't do that\nOr at Franklin got the ball back after twenty two yard kickoff return by all when Paul Mary\nAh they drove in their own forty four to the outer boroughs ten huge hit by ... el on a third and three play forced to fourth out on the thirty two yard field goal was no good wide right by the road standing a place kicker Parker Chevron adult borrow then came back\nAnd my brother my gotten a better mood\nWith a sixteen play eighty yard drive to third doubt conversions to four thousand conversions a seven yards past who are we're just choose me are striking seven yard pass to Ethan Cameron uh Justin where it was a bull\nRun Jason where it was a bold running the ball a fabulous trap blocked by Isaac ... yellow adjusting code he's twenty six yard run to the one yard line than a sneak on touched by we're in for the touchdown PAT was good fourteen seven\nAnd that's just a wide veer when you do that you come out with the ... and you have a wing and the tight end and the ... in the wing doubled down on the defensive in in the back side guard comes flying down the line of scrimmage go to jail and he makes the great block and when you it's it's a wide veer what should the ... the runner\nGets to the whole he decides how he's going to attack the defense of corner\nAnd we've seen Cody do this enough he always has a nice little tip inside these quick and you're thinking he's down to the boundary up a gate\nThat's going to leave a lot Callahan is joined us [noise]\nGood evening yeah great run by Jason too on that can be sneaker they bounce off\nGood evening yeah great run by Jason too on the on the ... bounce off at our summer fifty and then went in untouched ah I'm not sure if that was Ellis out there and this can be secret does sound did you see a what'd you say where it's number fifth oh okay I looked at the wrong young sorry what's\nUh uh I'm touched a for for the snake for the touchdown nice job I was I was with your brother in law he was a little concerned on the first Dr or as well yeah we don't even read it in the first quarter\nTo five and that was the\nBeginning of the drive and then drive\nTo see how the team settled down and really compose for\nThe first down to one third down\nTo on for them and everyone was a great power play when they were sending letters in our line pick them all up so impressive\nBut in in in going back to the first try for Frankel and the concern for me more as a fan yes a is how good\nDefense was against the run\nUp to you know the dog and they weren't given up any points and then all of a sudden the answer I got a bunch of point last week\nThen yes in their strengths of stopping the run yeah and you're seeing Franklin's going in essence right off the middle I Know you could point to reasons why but the ... that that is strengthen your way into the playoffs out I don't want that to become a weakness I'm like it's something well something exposed on film to Franklin pick up something what's going on here\nI when I played in college and this by the by the way this is the end of all times in the late sixties but we ran the Notre Dame for four yeah which is basically what they run so if if there's a big center guard split your defensive tackle jumps into that and your linebacker sees that and it's an automatic so we now steps out\nBecause you know the guards gotta be blocking down so he's going to have the second gap\nAnd if that you know I just thought that's all we should have done the second thing that drives me crazy and pros and the modern game if they could have put out too wide outs either way and you're calling on my back is back five yards up the bar and you're calling\nAnd I put it out too wide outs either way and your coat on my back is back five yards up the bar and you're caught his back a softball you're giving them that bubble screen yeah you have to put you Cornel linebacker right up in the face of that second why does it on the way that yeah you hit him with the hand shiver\nYou force him inside so you maintain contain and you drop straight back into the hook so that's all you do and if he gets by and goes deep that's what the safety so that's what the deep safety for ... and it's it's so it's awfully frustrating to see all these passing attempt to just such easy completion yeah a costing us too valuable yard it after ...\nTook the fourteenth seven leading the second quarter Franklin drove from their own thirty seven yard line to the Fifteen yard line of adult borrow\nA clean Charles had a big sec in there but then they beat us for that bubble screen yes with a line backers off the first down the whole screen passed a number five Ryan ... of a dry stalled well\nHow 'bout that seem passed out on the same dilemma that jak right that was a gorgeous playing and really a really nice tackle on that because he was running straight up the same and he's six three to five and I just I didn't know who is a Ethan Cameron who made the tackled arose Cody but it was a beautiful open field tackle yup\nAnd that was a twenty four year old gay and in that play the Sean letter and then they shut them down yes\nYes yes the drive in with a thirty two yard field goal\nFrom Parker Chevron and then add up are all was about a minute left\nSeven five yard will run for you are wherever on a third and one of five yard or just in Cody Robert looked like he was going to be dropped the loss of two\nAnd then in the final seconds twelve yard past the sophomore Justin Daniels Nineteen yard past the ether and camera Justin Cody through a great block in the backfield you know and that led to the thirty five yard field goal by\nCoby breaks yeah in Seventeen Seventy ... yeah I I moved to add a borough in in two thousand\nYeah and seventeenth seven out of all I I moved to add a borough in in two thousand I'm probably going to the games in two thousand five and I think that's the first field will I've seen made\nBy and I had a real place kicker it's been a long time since I've seen an actual field goal it's great to see a strong leg on the sophomore brings a very impressive and he must have got the confidence and the coaches confidence uh last year and last week on the thirty are an extra point\nAgainst Mansfield so that that was great great momentum and a half now at a rose got the ball to ah to start the second half as well with a lot of momentum\nI was so impressed with that last drive because when Franklin cut the lead to four points with only one forty two to go\nAnd you've got a ways to go down the field and they moved down the field a Tom Brady style we picked a field goal you don't see that in high school football too much ... very well played half only to pedal least well off site on on a ... it actually three and a procedure that ... it'll hold your which thankfully it was a very good call it stopped it of course they got the field goal\nBut a Nick Evans who was a terrific a defense then he literally gets held on every play here there and you know they call at once in a blue\nMoon that was obvious that hold on one of the hell do the whole plane did they call they had no joy to\nThe white hat didn't struggle fly\n... the umpire finally through the flag he was embarrassed we'll be right back after this with firsthand stats at the half time out over oh

yes\nIn scholastic coach magazine yell I remember that yeah well the average net puns about twenty five yards in high school wow it's not like in college where the average that hearts punt the higher level you go yeah like in the pros the average knots over forty right and how big time it's the it's high thirties so twenty five yards it's a it's an okay ... you know given the situation but\nFor down territory for Franklin that coming out in the type punch to the left the split to the right moving right to left\nEmotion is now Ellie but they give to the running back Paul Mary coming up the middle\nAnd he's going to move out from the ...\nAnd he's going to move out from the ... forty seven to the ... forty three I Believe for yard game Evans in an attack all along with Rica and ...\nOnce

attack\nWho comes in second six play they give to pulmonary running left and making that tackle\nIt up all evidence and Evans again shaking and that left elbow yeah uh but Evans made to tackle Paul merry go forward to the outer boroughs thirty nine nice one by pulmonary human hyper extended his elbow there because he Paul mirrors halfway by me through that helped me out I'm Out that is really painful\nThat's another four yard gain for Paul married it'll be third and two Franklin\nAt the thirty nine of aloe borrow Weatherford comes in now and he's a little under size at defense event but shakeup will do anything he's out of our all coaches ask him to do yeah he's just a Johnny, Johnny on the spot kind of guy that ... the three or four main front here [noise]\nEvans is still in there

third down yeah and it was thirty two and a he got frustrated with the nice job by the white officer tackle came inside and that gave the escape route ... in such a good Russian side really those too\nEcho came inside and that gave the escape route ... in such a good Russian side really those two bad nice play but frankly\nSeven yard gain on that scramble there at the thirty to Gordon over his

Weatherford his own twenty nine across his own forte taken down nice tackle made by number fifty four Franklin and that is coal Sweeney a junior\nWell that'll boroughs not out of the Franklin is just put on a tremendous surge was Twenty one fourth quarter points actually not Twenty one fourth quarter points for Twenty one consecutive points starting with a\nI think there was a yeah those six twenty three to go in the third with when you have a vote went up twenty four ten\nSo it was for a team that go they scored and the third and then they scored twice in the last four minute wire on the fourth and they'd been huge plays mhm I mean once again they get tuned in eighty seven yards passing and they haven't throwing the ball completed more than Fifteen Years down the field at once all night\nAre runs to the right behind ... blocks fracking is striking was living in the third quarter Mike and\nHe is obviously laboring out there who do the whole team is they they don't have the depth and it's really showing here Jason where they're going to give them two yards on the run from the forties old forty to his own forty two certainly no lack of heart but when you both everybody's going both ways are so many guys going both ways it's really tough\nAnd out over all that time right off before they call that time out is the twenty second time out so we'll keep it right here the second half started\nThe twenty second time out so we'll keep it right here the second half started [noise]\n\nWith the score Seventeen seven adult borrow and he didn't have any ten excuse me out over when it had twenty four ten\nOn a beautiful throw to Ethan Cameron from Jason we're also completely a twenty four year our past and a fourteen your past in that Dr fracking came right back they drove\nFifty four yards and just for plays a fifty yard touchdown and a screen past ... battle borrow gained twelve yards by striking but went back Fifteen because of a job lock\nAnd then Cody game fourteen yards Cody gained twenty five yards but fumbled recovered by Franklin at their own nine and since then it has been all Panthers as they scored twice to take a thirty\nOne Twenty one time they didn't score they drove the ball fifty yards yeah and it's all been in the air\nAnd not long in the air just to kind of things where they're avoiding fight it out on the line of scrimmage and doing a very success trips right\nTossed to Cody on the right flat had to spend to catch it makes the catch and he's taken down short or first down your age how in heaven's name did Evan words get that far outside to make that tackle it will be thirty four\nWell how in heaven's name didn't Cody make that great says yes I thought hey this feat in game five yards and that was a so it's they're down and I'd say a long story whatever the case may be uncalled for your game but there's no lack of of invite neither one of these teams the elderly playing hard one oh six to go\nOut with a minus forty seven this was for down territory with one of six to go\nAs\nThird and along three where has time throws to the right catches made by Cameron knocked out of bounds and he's as far as the [noise]\nCatches me by Cameron knocked out of bounds and he's as far as the Franklin [noise]\nThirty eight yard line\nNow there's an obvious hold on cue and left back all wasn't close [noise] okay [noise] yeah I watch the ... and sort of the lines with him and when the defense Vince spins around and you're still holding them it's pretty easy to see while\nSo that's the office of holes that really hurts doesn't mean it's over fans anything can happen in high school football if the nine seconds left what a comeback for Franklin and [noise]\nPlenty of time you saw this last week but that was a very [noise]\n\nMy God he called the whole from in the backfield ... and ended up to Thirteen yard penalty wow [noise]\n\nThat's supposed to be a start spot fall it can't be Thirteen Years ago now they put it up to thirty seven okay good I'd rather get it right I mean these the spot on a hot principled is the line of scrimmage not where the whole bicker\nThird and Thirteen ... Franklin blitz is here comes weren't getting to a lot of running we're who try to throw it deep [noise]\nIncomplete [noise]\n\nThey just got to run that yeah\nAnd I want to get the name of the defender there but anyway that's ink completed it'll be fourth and Thirteen for adult borrow from their own thirty seven\nJust fifty one seconds to go the second half after that scores been dominated by Franklin that's obviously the pressure\nYeah you know it's a once again when you have mostly kids play in one way and they played inspired football I think Jason that time if you pump ache or just ran it would have got it there was nobody out in front of ... ... yeah you know once again it's hard to teach high school kids when they put you in there playing man you get outside\nShowing Leonard plane defensive tackle now for Franklin where uh\nSean Leonard plane defensive tackle now for Franklin we're on the raw and middle screen to Cody tackled\nAnd Mike we mentioned we didn't call his name much in the first half\nHe has been dominant and the second half\nWell once again he read the key all the way Paul good football and he's a good football player and Franklin is going to go away with a victory here and they've earned it fall wow it's heartbreaking as it is for a adult burrows a Frank and this has been a tremendous comeback to school at Twenty one points in the last Fifteen or sixteen minutes wow\nAnd is still one of the three to go no forty four days we actually ... to go yeah so they did this and they really took over the game part while\nThey really stopped ... ended up with a hundred yards\nWill probably two hundred and fifty ads total opposite of the first half of ... had to say that a hundred and twenty three yards total opposite that second drive they had in the second half where they\nIt was really beautiful drive ... but after that they've just been stymied\nBoy that twenty five yard run with a formal was caused by arsenal when they had that late yes that would have put 'em up thirty one Seventeen and you just wonder and then Franklin drove fifty yards didn't score but a lot of it about thirty one to ten yeah exactly thirty one to ten right you\nKnow no thirty one Seventeen because they were had twenty four ten after their first driver the third quarter Franklin came back with a fifty yards screen passed you're right\nThat's right which by the way it once again uh I I don't know what our second level of defense was looking at [noise]\nQuite great game ... great game heartbreaking loss for the move on but here's\nAnd Franklin would just snap at once more we won't hold the stats against\nNo Nick Gordon\n\n\n\n\n\nCreators of gives you the we give him\nChoose your view on\nSome are not following a a\nWhich has come out [noise] oh\nMan

Want to give kudos to um to police officers in out of ... um actually you know you never know who the heroes are and you're among here is but to officer McKenzie and Harrington on August twenty seven became here as in the city of out of our all\nBecause please call up people were calling the police station saying that a man was on Newport avenue with a gun\nAnd as officers arrived at the scene this person was shooting at the officers cars now they could have been killed because of bullets had been\nI mean they show he shot through and the windshield and the uh the seats and the officers were like ducked down but one of the officers ran out jumped out of his car and it was able to uh shoot the shooter and knock them down\nUp to twenty miles an hour winds so I'll make sure you hold onto the gorge of the pumpkins in your hand though they might get blown off but\nNo but seriously or the good news is we have the milder temperatures today now yesterday\nNo but seriously or the good news is we have the milder temperatures today now yesterday morning we had our first freezing temperatures in the adult borough area and the Senate he uh since April twenty fifth was the last time that happened a week looks like going to happen again on Monday morning so if you're someone who still have some of those plants\nYou worried about some of them growing even the late season vegetables\nIf they're still growing a from the other night and early yesterday morning a well Monday morning could be another one that might try to finish them up but at any rate we're going to have temperatures today in the low to mid sixties this afternoon so that's the good news\nThe not so good news though from some maybe is it's kind of stuff you get colder again late tonight now late tonight\nI expect the chance of a shower a very low impact about as low\nImpact that you ever get us I liked the sailing if something happens very late it on a Saturday Night or early Sunday Morning it's the one night where most people are indoors\nTrying to sleep late on a Sunday Morning and so we get a quick rain showers said for tomorrow morning or it should not be much of a deal but it will introduce a cold or Sunday so while we get to say sixty three today I'm expecting a high up is forty seven\nOr tomorrow with us the wind out of the northwest back the winds tomorrow I Will be stronger maybe up to thirty and thirty five miles an hour and a few Gus ... mid day\nAnd then we'll have diminishing winds almost a replay of the other night where we cool off this is tomorrow night Monday morning and then we'll have more prosperous especially on some of the windshields if you have your vehicle outside\nAs we joke again if you leave it under a tree you have less of a chance of getting frost on it or however we're going to have a high temperature on Monday of uh upper forties\nAnd then if we go into Tuesday we warm up again in the middle fifties just the chance of a shower and then colder weather moving in for Wednesday\nBut again no big rain makers or snow makers at least for now wow no kidding wow\nNope big rain makers or snow makers at least for now\nWow no kidding well I'm going to Boston leader tonight so you're saying that it's going to be maybe raining tonight\nLater tonight you mean you're going what ... after midnight\n[laughter] no no no no I'm I don't use I'm going to an event you know I'm going to Boston from\nLike seven to like one thirty I guess there's a A R fundraising event tonight as a\nManager at actually yeah okay uh well you'll go outside of probably dealing with at least a bit of traffic or today I Know they have that regard to on the Charles river there that are ruined we've got going on there today it's all by tonight that will have moved out so right of truck traffic shouldn't be too bad I'd say the temperatures will be falling\nLane through the through the fifties this evening knowledge when those okay fine right away any any white shawl would be more like four or five in the morning\nOh no no I'll be home by then they go in that I shouldn't be owned by then hopefully save\nDrive says no up next week uh is going to be kind of liked it has been this past week we've had very brief would quit boats with precipitation and I uh saw your message earlier in the week that you were out in a quick shower over by every square mall is that true\nYes oh my God I was driving home I Swear to God I wasn't playing cards shot [laughter]\nBut yeah I went to AA and all of a sudden the wind picked up it's swirling around to breathe it was like what the heck is going on so what I did this I ducked into emerald square um I went where Macy's is this a garage thing so I went under there\nAnd park there and then I I thought well I'm not going to stay in the car so I have to go into the mall for a little bit\nSo yeah it was just the wind picked up a really really quickly and like I said to breathe the papers and branches and\nReally really quickly and and like I said to breathe your papers and branches and all kinds of different things that are flying all over the highway which like grains going on\nYeah that was the cold front that are made the chill on the other day and then the frost yesterday morning but that it didn't last long but it was bad like as you were in it\nAnd others for probably out is saying what's going on I mean this is how we in Kansas or Darcy or whatever you know so but no but seriously but but I bring that up and again I'm Glad you're OK getting through that\nUh but uh we're in this pattern where we have up and down temperatures but any rain or snow is very brief I say snow because it did snow in parts of Maine New Hampshire and Vermont over the last couple of days mainly in the mountains right up but it was some snow and as each day passes of course we have a\nA closer and closer chance of getting a maybe a few snowflakes as we get towards the end of this month but I don't see that happening now next week of course the world series and I'll have more updates or one more updated as always leaned just\nAfter eight o'clock with me more to it and it's like right now\nIf you know only one or the planning to go to the world series of course uh both Tuesday and Wednesday evening's at Fenway Park\nOr if they both look mostly dry but yet again just like you experienced the other day and we might even get late tonight they might be just a quick passing shower at some point Tuesday in the afternoon that should be about it and the temperatures will be falling\nThrough the upper forties that game time so both of those games are going to be chilly what do you expect you playing baseball in late October the\nWednesday game the Wednesday the game to at Fenway and they still don't know yet who they're playing his either Los Angeles will Milwaukee\nThat game could be as low as thirty eight thirty nine degrees and that could be a big deal so a plan accordingly anyone go into the world series uh uh in Boston or this week Wednesday game especially we could be looking at wind chill during the game\nUh this week It's Wednesday game especially we could be looking at wind chill during the game maybe as low as freezing so that is probably the sort of what a good little or no precipitation at all ... states just mostly dry\nAnd ... much of a next week really we'll talk more about what could happen as we approach Halloween Elaine coming um yeah if you get the next weather right after eight o'clock or just a tease you can get back to all the good stuff\nOkay that sounds great Jim thank you so much and I look forward to chatting with you at age\nI like to talk to them by al ... great\nThank you and they go to Jim carbon and wow talk about the crack of the bat and looks like it's going to be really really cold my God\nMy grandfather was at the Nineteen Seventeen World Series Boston Red Sox really you know and he spent his whole life waiting for them to go

them for God's sakes\nAnd you know how you ... you can position of picture where you have you're standing like in front of somebody take a picture then you can you know modify the picture so looks

just want to let you know in the next hour they'll feel rain shower but the rest of today into this evening no weather issues in terms of ah going anywhere are visiting anywhere going out tonight for everything going on so the good news is we're going to be a little breezy today loaded mid sixties\nSo at least it won't be as cold as it was yesterday morning a much colder though tomorrow so tomorrow will be a windy chillier day Mitt in upper forties and then as we go through much of that at least a few days next week mainly dry or with the\nThirties at night and forties low fifties during the day so we're back into a slightly colder than average weather pattern fact today\nDuring the day so we're back into a slightly colder than average weather pattern fact today this afternoon may actually\nBe the warmest afternoon we'll have for several days so I'll take advantage of that if you can I wanted to mention that we do have a full moon next week next Wednesday the full hunter moon and I say that because it means a week later which was Halloween they will not be a moon so this Halloween\nWill not feature any kind of a moving until well after midnight so it'll be a moment's Halloween\nHowever the next full moon after that is the full beaver moon which is the Friday after Thanksgiving so those would be that like to look at the moon you'll have a around Thanksgiving to enjoy that as well and finally a lame game seven of the world series if there is a game seven\nOf course it would be at Fenway Park in Boston in that game would be played on Halloween\nWow no kidding oh my God that's great\nIf it goes given go southern games but\nI noticed that many games you know why because it's money money money\nWell that's true they're probably going to make it somehow get that way but anyway no now and I I'll finally end on this so we can get back to the great information with the\nFollies now a there is going to be a storm threat next weekend here so are some indications of the uh a coastal storms that could produce high winds and heavy rains next weekend that's not asking stone it's a week out but okay we may be dealing with stormy weather about a week from today so we'll be monitoring it all week but again enjoy the weekend the the only\nNegative I guess you can say about today is that it's a little breezy out there but it's not cold it will get

[laughter] okay [laughter] right a\nGovernor undo wants to get you ... is to be run over by a bus [laughter] from one to two books in and out the vote for him again [laughter] no and\nKnow ... and they got what that is a Rob sounded like you sound like yeah I'm and I'm doing it now in the show but it's it's no Dave King thank you very much so I'm going to be a survey and he's with you guys\nOh in the show but it's it's no Dave King thank you very much so I'm going to be a civilian these with you guys and with and uh at uh the crown plaza\nYeah doing both those ... yeah and so that'll be go to the only nights I wasn't working I could get we don't get a chance to see each other professionally because he needed to go to ... you know so we have is a great friend he calls me almost every\nSo somebody listening right now how can they help what can they do to help your your mission here\nWell we've got a couple of ways um people can sponsor a well um we've got three different kind of wells we've got spring wells which as you probably know in the in the mountains of North America and many people get their drinking water from springs that get developed you dig down you develop the spring\nAnd uh you can spots of one of those for thirty five hundred dollars okay I'm all we do traditional wells that are about sixty feet deep\nUh lined with concrete and hand pumped schools\nThose are about six thousand and then the deeper wells are we use our drill rig have to drill down as much as six hundred and fifty feet those costs around ten thousand and we're we're pretty much in line with the industry of what it costs to duties water projects in developing countries\nNow when you when you say thirty five hundred and thirty five hundred dollars a you guys can drill moved to whatever you do do do get to the stream and then it just flows continually after that right I mean so it's that's right and there's no maintenance so to speak right yeah yeah\nThat's right no maintenance no moving parts the break mhm it'll just keep working\nOn an amazing investment isn't it it's it's amazing and and and we have a spring like that\nAn amazing investment isn't it it's it's amazing and and and we have a spring like that\nWhere would you um what would it feet or how would you uh you do it\nI guess you have to do it in the play obviously the place where you can get one fine when we drove them one and then it would feed a villages or what\nThat's right yeah somewhere between maybe two hundred and five hundred people wow a would come down to that spring every day and get water and for our sponsors what we do because some\nSome organizations you've you've heard you know ... what if I send my money to this developing country how do I know what you're done with it and some organizations have muddy the waters for the rest of the spy\nNo pun intended\nYeah no good one yeah I didn't think of that money\nUm and they sell projects two or three times over two or three different dollars and they all think they're the sole provider of that project yeah so what we do for peace of mind and accountability as we let you name that project\nSo let's say you name it in memory of a lot of blood cell or whale of hope will well laser\n... stainless steel plate and more pronounced it at the source okay and then we'll take pictures of that and we'll give you the GPS court oh wow so you could actually see somebody and you know what Facebook editing worlds really small you can actually find people in other countries get run errands for you\n[laughter] yeah oh so you say oh\nYou don't have to yeah you don't have to send an investigative journalists to find out if we're doing our job yeah but you can send someone to that GPS coordinate and see if there's really only one plate on it and made it really does say the name that you guys\nMhm yeah and that's great to be transparent yeah\nIs to really know now that they see that at school I've certainly seen get a picture and send it to you you know that that really be great\nThat's cool I've certainly seen get a picture and send it to you you know that that really be great to have that I mean for thirty five hundred dollars it's like nothing is using the same it's that old ... was that old ... there was a comedian years ago in the fifties you talk about they had used to have ads on TV all the time and they'd say you know\nFor ... for one dollar a day you know ... ... can send his children to school and closed them and that the ... for one dollar\nAnd the comedian used to say boy if I can get him to teach me how to stretch a ... huh [laughter] I Would [laughter] you know and and and and but this is really true I mean it it it's thirty five an hour that's an amazing\nOpportunity isn't it to ... to feed hundreds of ... of water every day and that's great now\nWhat did you do before this and don't tell me you were on luminal storm citing salesmen or something like what what did you do before you didn't ... I was a\nYou know I was a radio show host\nNo just kidding [laughter] oh you've been proved your life that's good that's great we got you out of the drugs yeah\nYeah I you know how that they also Marcia where they say wait there's more\nYeah oh yeah you know you as a side issue opportunity site issue sided issue the guy who wrote that ... that is from Rhode Island\nAnd he's a friend of mine the ginsu knives commercials but wait there's more yeah yeah my yeah buddy Edie Edie ... wrote that but anyway go ahead so you were saying what I'm Sorry that you\nWere on the sponsorships you know everybody doesn't have thirty five okay so we have a thing called one shot and inspiration for one tribe came from the idea that man I don't have thirty five hundred bucks a I just have a little bit of money and\nHow can I say like five dollars or twenty five dollars to Africa and have it eat it\nHow can I send like five dollars or twenty five dollars to Africa\nAnd have it easy to get there right you know the postage will probably eat up all the money sure so what do I do and but you know what if a couple of hundred people did the same thing ... you know all those quarters at up\nAnd you also so we developed something called ... and now we have a few\nVery gracious donors who agreed to let us use their donations for adding it\nBecause nobody wants to find the ad in a row these guys said okay we'll fund the ads and so you can start one tried and so our problem is is\nI'm Sorry I'm missing what's admin I administration fees Lawrence okay yeah okay go ahead you know they're talking about TV show afternoon or good\nYeah yeah [laughter] so nobody wants to fund the administration okay yeah salaries\nOr whatever you know office costs and so with one tried\nEvery dollar that goes into the one tried pot we promise to send that to Africa and apply it to the work none of it gets touched in the U.S and so imagine this one dollar will provide water for one person for so that that\nMetric is really it's really by these sense but we just say one dollar so easy to remember\nIs now is even less than a dollar Ninety cents than a\nDollar yeah a means for example\nTwenty five dollars provides water for twenty five people for a year or if you spent twenty five a month that's three hundred people a year\nThat you're providing water for ongoing for the cost of the few then the lattes at Starbucks you know ... so that's what we promise to anyone who's a monthly a subscriber if you go to our website hit that thing\nWho's a monthly a subscriber if you go to our website hit that thing of donate to one tribe and whether it's five dollars a month or twenty five dollars a month or so we've got some people get into and fifty dollars a lot whatever amount that is it's all subscription\nOur commitment as that goes into one tried every penny will go to Africa to the work\nMm that's beautiful\nYeah and that's the way by the way this is Don a pat down again it goes with me in the morning and uh she was all excited about having you on a ... she my fascinated by what you're doing\nYeah he said that the entire country ... ... and having those struggles against East Africa\nWell each area has its own issues and North Africa it's really tough to working as a western organization\nOr because of the political climate there ah South Africa as you know it's very developed yeah um\nAnd we're in East Africa so picture the horn of Africa and more mostly in Kenya and Tanzania Mm um\nAnd and we thought we'd leave all the way across the continent but you know Africa as big as you can fit the U.S China and a lot of Europe and a few other countries all inside the costs of Africa that's\nHow big it wow I mean I Know that you have today Mm yeah wow\nAnd so this is quiet [laughter] and then taking you decided to jump into um what is made you most I'm encouraged in the time you've been doing this what has happened or what have you seen as many do and it has anything to do more encouraged for what you're doing\nYeah I got a couple of quick stories ... er and said okay tell stories\nWe don't we love stories you kidding me oh ...\nWhere are you know I don't know we love stories you kidding me I was ...\nYeah our social workers went up on a village one time and no kidding everybody was just waste in a way like they were all uh barbiturates or something and just discouraged and just\nSitting around and they asked them what you know they were just doing their surveys where they go around ask people these basic questions where are you getting your water and so on to see if we can help and they said our village is we're all dying of aids\nAnd we're all going to die\nAnd they said wow who told you ... you have age and they they lifted the symptoms are the fatigue and uh know immune system and on and on and so\nOur guy started looking into things is to show us where you're getting your water and come to find out this deal it's just given up\nThey were drinking water with what they call them our social workers call it a war and it's a parasite they were getting it from a\nUnprotected spring so they had this parasite living in and that was just eating all the food so they sued and the parasite each\nAnd water borne disease in those areas that the second biggest killer\nIn some areas it kills more children and the biggest killer which is malaria malaria is tough you can't do much about it but water borne diseases a hundred percent preventable\nMm and Thomas Jefferson died water borne disease ... remember\nJames Paulk there's so many people in our history dozens who died from dysentery diary of water borne disease typhoid cholera some things\nFrom their drinking water in about a hundred years ago a it was the second biggest killer in America second only to um tuberculosis so this is a problem\nThat we didn't solve all that long ago and just because we saw that first there's no reason to not reach out how the rest of the world so so a big thing you're doing to answer your question as we're teaching hygiene in the schools and we found or the or the world health department found that if you\nGive people clean water it's only about Fifteen Percent effective at a eliminated water borne disease if you teach them hygiene and how to keep that water clean and keep their bodies claim\nIt's also about Fifteen Percent affected but if you combine both of those that statistic sky rockets eighty five\nCool wow so we teach the hygiene in the schools as well to many more schools they were able to even provide water for and uh you know we I used to watch women collect\nYou know we I used to watch\nWhen they collect the clean water and wells I'd\nSit there with the camera to take pictures you realize they were collecting the water and dirty buckets because they didn't get it\nBecause nobody gets hotter right\nThey just thought this water special but the water's special special they do have to be cold and so we realize well we've got to like hygiene huge part\nIt's interesting because you're talking 'cause I'm thinking to myself all the big push that people trying to do here a jet just to get people to wash their hands yeah\nYou know just washing I mean we have you know diseases spread all over the place here now in hospitals of course and I love it when you go into buildings on their own the pure ... dispensers all over the place you can is but I just getting people to wash their hands is\nIsn't it I didn't know that he was saying [laughter] yeah but the people you know they don't they get distracted they not paying attention they don't think it's\nAll that important at that moment you know something's going on and unless they have to pick up some kind of group or something they they don't think about it right yeah and and and this is one of the things that really really gets to people\nAnd certainly in the areas you're talking about that but even here you know I mean it's just crazy I commend every morning and I are done and it was a\nMillennia spirits in freak cleaning the keyboard here and stuff like that man drove board but this is an example where people don't think about it they go into touch all this stuff\nAnd you know uh my wife um doesn't [laughter]\nIsn't training me to be a gentleman you know it gentleman always opens the door for a lady the reason I open the door for Joanna because she won't touch the [laughter]\nTime she'll stay in touch that now yeah huh\nI'm Joe stand up high touch them now yeah huh ... which they pet average\nShe could get you to do that how is your hand after that\nI Am a once in a while she will yeah she's in a good mood yeah uh but [laughter] you know I mean she um joins like ... and make a ton of stuff\nAnd so it's kind of funny because they'll see was stopped and people think that I'm you know I've been trained to do because that's one way to Albany 'cause I Know we're going to be in that building until midnight you know it's I I Am [laughter]\nSo this this is the thing that people don't think about it so even if you are listening right now and you think of how can I help here's one way you can help but also you can help yourself and help the environment and help the world by\nNot only washing your own hands but telling others to explain to others getting kids to make it a routine all the time yeah you know I don't even eat with his hands are you going to eat with what I'm saying yeah exactly right yeah yeah yeah [laughter] ... or ... like my language do you ...\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] and so a lot of grace what had gone down by grace developed\nIs a wonderful in debt hygiene curriculum that's aimed especially at life in East Africa we've got like sixty\nIllustrations and she we've got social workers now that go around and teach this and villages and the schools it's so why opening it so life changing for them the simple facts about\nUnderstanding what germs are and they're not understanding how to block those pathways from the germs getting into our bodies that I tell you what they'd changed me and it changed\nYou know the way I exit the bathroom you know they got those hidden cameras say only three people wash their hands\nYou know coming out of the bathroom and that's scary but she she had a woman come up to her early on when she was wondering\nThat's scary but she she had a woman come up to her early on when she was wondering are these classes a lot of good and this lady came up afterwards and said wow I didn't know I was the one making my baby sick\nBecause she wasn't careful how she was handling the water and the other things and so she was the one introducing she just thought\nBabies get sick last for her to get sick and she realized I Am the one doing this and now I can change it somehow our ...\nAnd there's a ... thing going on here too well you're talking you mentioned your wife grace now you had the vision in you bumped into the guy and uh you guys all this I did get anybody on board but do you get your wife on board with this\nAh this was not her original concept right how ... what was that like what was I mean she sounds like she's of course committed to it in his boat in but when you first\nTalked about it what was what was she doing I mean what would we she or at home mom if you have another ...\nYeah uh-huh she was like we called her ... block of this oh the the administrative assistant for an attorney ... uh and she was loving it\nYou had to get around to that job because of you guys got divorced you'd get beaten up bad boy [laughter] so [laughter] you get her out loud he\nI I just said come with me because I went back and forth for eight\nYears at a time no kidding force for four to six times a year and that's how we did it that was all beginning everything was volunteer everything was like squeezing everything they could out of a dollar because we you know just getting started\nDidn't have any money and and um so she got\nShe got bit by the bug and she had on all\nShe got she got bit by the bug and she\nHad on all the way there you go wonderful wow if you heard Patrick talk about Islam and all\nYes then you know the legacy sure\nYou know that people are friends with me they just so they can be friends with\nHer for a million dollars to Donna Donna is that sounds familiar in your life you know ... nobody likes me they all like joy and yeah they all like Joanna [laughter] nobody likes to me\nAnd and that's interesting but [laughter] I'm In ... you said you been doing it for years she wanted to make sure it wasn't just a fan [laughter]\nYeah yeah it wasn't I mean and then she that see that's great because now you're not fighting a different battle of saying honey I got to go back you know right\nNow she's with you that ... and into it and you gain all of the contributions that she makes which I'm Hassan light in your own mode considerable\nHuge yeah it made it better right yes yes and expanded yeah yeah when when I said go ahead I'm Sorry that\nShe grew up on her grandfather founded a school Costa Rica and our father took it over when she was young so she grew up on the mission field ... I was an army brat and Africa she was living in Costa Rica as missionaries kids\nAnd then after high school she went to college and that's where we met\nAnd a twenty something years later she starts following me to Africa we now we lived there fulltime oh wow so we're yeah fourteen years into this and ...\n... ... that's amazing and and and I want to point out by the way when I was talking about how badger was talking about a year we were talking about you and grace I mean he was saying about my parents I I only reference to you because you and I are talking now but but he did he did talk about his great contribution by his mom as well and I just couldn't wait\nHis great contribution by his mom as well and I just couldn't wait to talk to you guys because I I I Would just so fascinated by doing something like this\nAnd people can go on your website and look at the video is alive and well you know the family and from Africa and what's going on and tell people react and everything\nYou know there's all there's a story thing on there the the bottom ... a website you can check out it's high draining humanity dot\nOrg right either eating humanity dot org\nAnd are you going to be part of this if you are listening right now you're going to be part of this and if you know somebody who isn't listening right now remember the show as always archived and you can go back to the to our website at W.

I don't know why at first of all I don't know why we're not hearing more about this nationally I mean think people are aware of it you're aware of it on his eyes have big money I I yeah buddy money has invested\nA play at this level and that's part of why I'm kinda like to be at the state level 'cause we can do things here in ... right we're going to ever happen at the federal level you write Monsanto has unlimited resources the lobbying and\nWell yeah that's fine but still people like Donna and there are across the country as it does it have you on etiquette island are handling can do it and if the states in New England can do it ... a right but that's what I'm saying I don't say when when people realized the\nThe importance of it\n... corporate money you can get people at least talking about whether or not you can get a legislation is is this the second problem but you know the first thing is that everybody talks about it I mean you know nobody is that if you go to the store now they're on the un cats\nThe first thing is that everybody talks about I mean you know nobody I say if you go to the store now they're on the end caps yeah aisles and aisles of roundup\nAmerica you know do they have their new brand on on it it's still called round Frank ... does anybody know that when they bought the bad company and they they were using their own logo I\nWhere you put your job to you could run she quit her job so she didn't she was she could've council job so she could run she quit now she didn't quit in the spring okay so you think is saying that it's\nNot a comparison I my my ... I think it's important what I did was to sever ties with everything I was doing before I ran for office if I didn't get in that's the way it goes I mean you get in or the uh the the I couldn't serve\nTwo masters yeah but again that that didn't have anything to do with the fact that she didn't finish her her run and I'm just trying to get along very compared to her you know I just want to answer my question John honest I just wanted I'm just asking 'cause when I read it listen when I read it I thought this was cheap\n... bowl shot so why didn't why doesn't she quit why did she run for office is for the city council\nShot so why didn't why didn't she quit why did she run for office just for the city council\nIf she knew she was going to run for state rep well she obviously didn't know until after the first deal went on right well we knew in November well okay say then she makes the ... well you have to do that was going to resign well maybe as much as you know what the hell is going to have well\nJim knows you know a whole row is gonna win right I'm not she certainly didn't think it was going to win\nRight I'm I'm not\nI'm not I'm not find a job Radley with you on this I'm just trying to you are and I am I ... you will stop you are okay we'll ... we'll walk away from your asking if you have something that I'm\nI Know [noise] feelings okay All right that's fine okay I ...

I did it as a state rep should have\nAh so odd Dr Dan muses from from the Bronx in the hospital\nHe came he is responsible for training police in the surrounding communities so he has one particular viewpoint my nephew Dan Hawkins came\nEasy a consultant for some of the bigger medical companies that are doing a lot of research on a scientific side of this uh alternatives to opioids are how the opioids affect the brain he brought that level of expertise\nI had Denise garlic who's the representative who's the chair of the joint house and Senate committee on mental health substance use in recovery she actually wrote the bill that the governor just signed a she brings pretty good knowledge about the legislative end of it ah\nI I had the c._e._o. from full or hospital or they have changed significantly in the last couple of years they're very very a much more involved in community outreach than they ever were before because\nI had a mayor on yeah I had politics and the fire department who talked about some of what they do for rescuing ... uh in the tribal number of rescues that they have to do and I had sergeant but at from the police department and they have to pay all the team that go around and and\nAnd I had sergeant but at from the police department and they have to be on the team that go around and and uh try to help people that have just been through people and their families so just been through a an overdose situation\nSo there was a pretty good variety a and we had a big crowd to a it was it was a very lively conversation and I think anybody left thinking that they learned a little bit about what's going on in Edinburgh it's\nProbably put something we should be really proud of ... and probably what we need to do next going forward mhm I'm I'm proud of that\nYou know I said well you should be I mean listen ... yeah knocking on doors and I did that nobody suggesting that you're you know\nCalling me and begging me for more airtime God Knows I Wish you weren't on Saturday I Know you wish I was around at all but I mean there's no [laughter] no no no I didn't know that we're you know these are\nBut you know there's no doubt while you're doing a good you're like well that's right yeah well I have yeah he's been pretty good to me though has an ... I mean the other people I've met people actually walk out of this really believe in and how can you what you lock the door I Can't\n[laughter] true that's true [laughter] that I have to get by Donald [laughter] yeah yeah I ... I don't think anybody suggest you're not doing your job at absolutely I think that uh and you're a low key guy\nPersonally accountable in key people want me to go see the ... and more and more gung ho and out\nThere and that's not me so that's that's just not what I Am and you can you can't change who you are mhm\nYeah you really can't no no and this is good and it's good to see it you know I'm so you feel like you're getting stuff done yes you feel\nHave an agenda for the next session of when we go back okay a ... issues with grandparents raising your grandchildren because they lost the parents ... two opioid addiction issues or other issues\nLegislation for the best interests the only time\nAddiction issues or other issues a legislation for the best interests\nThe only time in legislation that but you know we had we had more than one\nA family or in the station nightclub fire whose parents both parents died in the fire and the kids ended up with the grandparents\n... I I think it becomes issues with a lot of times these or grandparents so now they're living on Social Security and they've got the added financial burden raising children\nThere's issues with the biological parents having preference for custody when the biological parents home they still be chaotic because they're still addictions involved yeah a\nCivil legislation\nProbably brings the um well what does the legislation do was talk about what is it about the best interest of the child\nBut does it but it does it give grandparents more authority than they have now ... ... well yes\nThe legislation is not it is not favoring the biological parents when they may be better better equipped households to raise children you\nBecause you know a a grand parents don't have any rights and in most states and him ever since they as you know if they split up\nAnd you go to the mother has a kid of other guys and oh no no you're not going to see them you're not going to see the kid yeah the parents have the grandparents I'm no writing so would there be pieces of that in this little rushes to\nCorrect it it's like ten pages long so don't innocent little Tony sleep all into home now so I I Can't give you a good summary in ... the purpose of it and this is actually two bills or one Republican villain one Democrat Bill to complement each other to achieve that goal and um I've\nCommitted myself to work with both of them in January ... to help help advance that\nSomething like that well for one is the party that's paying for it right or if it was public financing and everybody was on the same playing\nField not let the party pay for example you're ... you're the party's candidate let the party put up the money if the party has money to the collected by advertising they had money to to pay you would have to be the person because\nYou know somebody gets bring that up because there\nIs a village that's been brought up that would allow a candidates to count childcare is a campaign expense\nSo there's not that far off the ... from some issues that have\nBeen brought up and that is an issue should the campaign be able to pay the candidate salary\nRight um and then if I don't have any kids I Can't get you know a lot of money to do whatever it is that's up till the candidate that to the party parties got to find out\nAnd how many people can\nTo the party parties got to find out\nAnd how many people can take time off from work to campaign they don't know if they're going to get in or not\nIf they can't take the time off then then that's a dead issue where we're saying he said as you say to your boss look I'm going to be I'm going to run for state\nRep yeah and uh I got a good shot at this and blah blah blah or can you give me what is it three months they off\nYeah on a more than that six month ... ... let's say OK let's say three months part time three months you know part time or whatever part time in three much off\nWould you do that for me would you and you know assuming that the Bush is also a Democrat and do you think should be good candidate is this yeah okay go ahead I'll let you do it who got and now the ... the party pays for his other part time while he's doing it and the full salary of the last three months\nAnd then he becomes the state rep\nSo that raises the fundraising stakes it makes it more expensive yeah sure yeah\nBut we already know it's expensive but the difference is that would be expensive for the right reason not just to get people to vote for you\nI I think we we agree that it it it's a system that could be better\n[noise] eleven forty one in the morning it is time to talk or to a more about radio but we have to take a break stay tuned okay here's one guy\nRhode Island college will hold their fall open

Rawlins in Tom Joyce helped us out start and now we are now that the seasons although we're going to get caught up so guess what I'm gonna get a lot of emails again\nSomeone is not going to be\nWe're going to get caught up so guess what I'm gonna get a lot of emails again [laughter] someone is not going to be happy or you know one life when you don't wait and see and hear guys [noise]\nBut uh\nWell here we live and go to the the meat and potatoes part of that I was on the Abington then they ah we had a stroke is a good point but you\nCan now do you think you're looking for [laughter] you said you're looking for the potatoes yeah that was not me [laughter] that was what I Am the W. they give you the right now\nI'm getting hungry I I feel your pain brother and his lunch hour or so All right hey thank you for calling brother\nI Know followed up by the way you Sylvia a pizza it's sort of of the time I went up there\nOh yeah good point [laughter] really Rich Cohen Bridgewater you had to do some editing all yeah\nLetting go let it go I'll get your pizza jeep is what tons of funds that title something to get them by me on the radio and get a pizza [laughter] I have a good weekend\nI used to it again I guess I got high\nAnd then the so that was correct Salvador watching online right yeah All right cool though I mean a Westfield ... okay um so does she have your phone we ready to rock and roll or she can now my phone out All right is it on his ... ready to go on Twitter uh it's it's actually on the page on the bottom heroin you go All right\nSo now this is a dilemma guy she has not dilemma we we let ... section one right so now now are we going to do is we got to find\nSo you wanna go undefeated teams first and now you I thought that I thought they deserve that okay I mean I Know you and I had this discussion or at the ... and ...\nBelieves the same thing that division one teams in division two teams I didn't mean to interrupt you I'm just in I'm not going to hear this discussion oh my God [laughter] good [laughter] well you want to go base\nIs just catching oh my God [laughter] good [laughter] well you want to go\nBased off of record in I guess I completely understand that but I myself want to go off of who I think is actually the better team ...\nOkay so my counter my no my devil's\nAdvocate I Know what to debate season but I'm right here we go whoa yeah west that and\nSo my my uh devil's advocate follow up to that I Hope I said that politically now will not political here we go just collect facts correct right is that if tri county and I'll use tri county they cannot help that they're in ... Maryland on everything is based on male enrollment so why should we\nDid actually not completely true based off mail in Rome and that's what I that's what I was so that's what we've always been told you know look at a team like BC high that does that it's all a middle school and they have what eight hundred nine hundred students write and Bridgewater random has I think a little bit more than that right there down in division now\nBridgewater random division one in every other sport except for football ... which I don't understand but I think it's part of the everyone gets to play mentality now yeah which is why we have more divisions than Texas ... yeah exactly correct doesn't make sense\nSo to follow up to answer brands question and again he made a great point the male enrollment is that if tri county has ... ... you know the original show let's say five Seventy five kittens right five and Seventy five kids Brockton has\nSeven hundred well you already know about your your broccoli is one of the biggest cities under the guise of Mississippi right but my point is why should I if if they go that Lucy Justin Alex I Know you're busy people people who got you guys you guys of the doctors I'm the one in therapy in the chair\n[laughter] so anyway [laughter] ... why should I punish tri county if they now you can only go back I'll go back four years bishop comedy when seven and all they were number one be a\nSevere and they were hanging around six in the ... you know what I'm saying why should why should like\nA severe and they were hanging around six in the ... you know what I'm saying why should why should not give them the same kudos that I Would give a division one school just because of this size in the division that their plan to no fault of their own why shouldn't I ... why shouldn't they be high in the number of times\nI think you're making too much of a big deal out of male enrollment in the size I'm more of just who you really think that bishop Connelly could've defeated the very end and football\nWe don't if they had them in my\n... I don't know if you're trying to avoid the answer I think you're truly know that the very end is\nOne of the not only the best team in the states or one of the best teams in the country right like effort is of course the north and we don't\nCut all how do we know of tri county doesn't have the same amount of kids to pick the ... the play football in that school again and picking on tri county not picking but actually in the pan to back\nIt kept trying to you know make the comparison with severe and if they have or how many kids are surrounding that let's say Fifteen hundred kids what happened to try counties Fifteen hundred kids and they're picking from all different stay all different towns 'cause there are regional school which sometimes can hurt you because again the prestige of going to a division one school playing football or hockey is better than going to get a trade\nOr I'm not I'm not I ... I think you folks in too much on division I'm just focusing solely on the team I Know that you know I mean in ... advantage to private school so anyone can go there and it's not like they're limited so maybe we're using severe and as a poor example\nYou know I think that's why maybe using see him as meat could be a poor example and uh arches can be a poor example because they're they're private schools if you want to think about public schools want you to compare a you know it seemed like tri county to Brockton where you're stuck with the kids in Brockton you stuck with the kids in tri county\nAnd you can go based off of that you really think that's where I can it can be brought in football maybe I don't know Brooklyn's had horrible year this year in football\nRight but the ... out again my my ... my counter argument a discussion probably discussion is has brought when the strike county I'm forty seven our kids to pick from ... you know what I'm saying but we have\nHas brought when the strike county uh forty seven our kids to pick from ... you know what I'm saying but I mean that's all right let's talk about we have right now the ... Alex we need we need we need we need to hand it doesn't matter what your opinion is well might matter because it might get your pizza so working that I'm only kidding [laughter] so I Believe it should be off\nI Believe it should be off record not size of school\n... I'm not basically an office I don't want to I mean I'm I'm basing it off of who I think is the better team\nBut I still think that's not fair because some schools have more kids pick from than other schools to try out for you know for different sport\nNow I understand that but you still have to you have to deal with what you got\nAll right we'll examine showing hand silent I'm going to say [laughter]\nThere you go to these and ah yeah I think that All right so I'm going to go above and valid valid um\nOpinion All right I'm sure what what do you guys think who want to go buy a record or the the the school itself ...\nTo ... to ... [laughter] as long as they get that\nAlex off the top of that but what do you think would make more sense school fees on yes I'd say\nI'm Glad he's sitting on that side [laughter] than I\nAm standing and seriously free thinking inside\nWhere you think just ... you know how much I Love these kids I Know that ... you wouldn't be sitting in that chair for the last five years\nThat's happened I I don't know this is tough to say well\nGee I Know but don't do me please don't like I lost weight and your opinion yes in your opinion what would you like to see what you liked him ranked by the school in the district the schedule is that fair to say more their record overall record on how they finished\nUh I've Shay record for headaches and shut the ties [laughter] I was just tired I don't hold on\n[noise] [laughter] well it sounds like someone\nRight I don't hold on [noise] [laughter] ...\nSounds like someone like what pack and I was a terrible drama will buy me\nA you know you can practice I can practice I mean when you're editing your shows at a Bridgewater TV yeah in your mind holding your footage and you're just waiting you're shaking your head out [laughter] look I think we both make good points I think you know you really can't go wrong with you know one way or the other I mean I understand that you want to get the best records\nYou know at the top of the rankings that totally makes sense\nBecause I think sometimes my other to add to my point is I think sometimes the smaller schools get\nUnder looked ... you know what I mean yeah but you again great point good a very good football program right and they may have what twelve hundred kids are natural maybe solve the smaller than Brock and ... and not have to do with coaching isn't you know to add to your point\nSo what do you think loose [noise]\nI'm not a lunch on commercials what's that do you want to do you want to do it after the break so that people listen to the commercials you know that's a good time to think that is the job a lot of free\n[laughter] well I'm ... I'm starting to like free form decide how to find\nSo Clinton didn't let me ask you this do you have a team like let's say ducks berry who's division three and they play a team like Bridgewater reined him in division to and let's say they have the the same record then who do you go for\nWhat was the other team name him on very [laughter] very feeds Bridgewater random head to head right which all that's ...\n... if they do that and that gives them that let's let's say Bridgewater random still is a better record\nAnd I think Bridgewater random should be ahead of should be done you know they just lost to just very overall rang [laughter] over Iraq has really yup\nOr not not that I missed\nAll right has really yup\nOr not not that I mentioned you know really interrupt that but how [laughter] I Know we're still trying to you know plow through our it's our top twenty\nOur show with that being said here other teams that are six and one that\nWe want to add to walk pool at a pool a wire a top twenty uh west Bridgewater now All right let's go over you know one of the overall rating\nWant we want to add that this is your show I'm African everybody's Kenyan I mean I think he should be in that case shouldn't be in the now case is currently six in one night and they have a better overall rating\nJust by using that as a rule of thumb that's on ninth team then we have to fall back to the ... valley which which was ... she just mentioned earlier they are currently\n... six\nShe just mentioned earlier they are currently\n... six no we have them six an hour they're already in oh can't and I'm Sorry can't insects under the old dogs\nThe ball ... small right yeah the Mayflower small then you have ... valley\nUm met wage right now all these conferences yeah me too I've been doing it for a long enough I Hope I should remember [laughter] uh let me see oh I'm Sorry ashlin Medway died um try valley and then can't and I would think can't would be next because they play out a hawk so can't will be on ninth team\nYeah I'd I'd like to give up if it really is there if there for the little bit if there is a tie and you're really trying to debate between two I gave a lot of edge to ... teams because that conferences stacked\nIs stacked only smoke All right so now we have to decide on a we have to decide\nWho which try valley team as next do we go we can go just way just the way the Herald hasn't ... met what sticks in one and done it no I'm Sorry ashlin Medway indict them all six normally could use their analogy there was that you think that's fair\nI mean the yeah go off that rating\nYou okay so ... attempt to team at six in one and a ... and all that such a way it is now number nine a Medway six\nAnd one and we're going to post is on uh on on forty fourth than datum six and one so that are twelve team as we start our new rocket I Want to make sure that um it's just six and one team I think the next one is going to be five in two\nWhere's neat in time to help us out with this yeah no kidding yeah will even be action I saw he had given us to tell us what to do colon yeah [laughter] sitting there with their feet up [laughter] All right so now we go to five and two teams\nAnd what their feet up [laughter] All right so now we go to five and two teams so now we have um a plethora\nOf division one teams that are five and two months or a division one so I'm going to see 'em Franklin\nWe can go need them like ... like like uh the bracket as a need them Catholic memorial Franklin oh yuck Franklin I'm OK don't try to shift Lauren that I'm Catholic memorial and Franklin correct need them Catholic Maureen I'm frankly need him\nAt five and two followed by a GM which is five and two and then Franklin out of the hot\nFive and two so that now we're down at ...
