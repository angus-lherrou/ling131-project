Jacob how's it going [noise]\nI'm doing well how are you good good good to be here 'cause it have you um have you been in here before have you done any interviews or this is an exclusive this is giving you the exclusive sounds good sounds good\nAll right so ah actually this can be a nice way to for the community to get to know you are kind of what you stand for what you want to have done a so for starters just tell us about who you are kind of your background and kind of experience what you've done\nA we grow up and everything it was like the whole lowdown yeah\nYeah no so I was a born and raised in the Dartmouth New Bedford area of southern Bristol county um I'd been familiar with Adel borough\nFor the area of southern Bristol county um I'd been familiar with adult burrow a as a child coming to last a lead for the ... the Christmas lights yeah yeah\nI think that was my first experience with adult borough but ah had the opportunity to move here um recently and uh um you know a decided to run for the seat or the prior to that uh\nIt was the first generation college grad in my family went to U. mass Dartmouth attending a public schools\nOr had a degree in finance worked in banking for it to a a little while and at that point I decided to uh uh parlayed that into the state house public service or had the opportunity to work with the Steven how is the representative or just south of here and see caulk and we're hoping Norton\nAnd uh through that experience\nAh really learned first hand how are the legislature works and more importantly how um\nThe uh the the\nGreat impact you can have on the local community and that's really what it's about um after that experience I had an opportunity after hard work to go to law school down in Virginia at Washington and Lee and a\nCame back here and was set to practice law and then a Senator Jim till multi all of a sudden resigned and it was a vacuum I'm In my party a I was asked to run and it was not the first\nThing on my mind and after a little bit of convincing we finally gave it a shot so it's been now we're going on Eighteen months of a constant campaigning for this legislative seat it feels like a presidential race [laughter] so and how has it been campaigning what's the feedback you kind of feeling from our community what are their\nConcerns ... you know what's the feedback you can get short so uh and when you mentioned community I just have to mention that this district is so large um this district\nI just have to mention that this district is so large um this district road wise it's about forty miles north to south from the southern tip of robots and seekonk all the way up to midfield in sharing and well poll a Adel borough happens to be conveniently located in the center of the district\nUm so really there are nine communities in this district a each community has very very bashed a\nA needs um different challenges\nI'm but generally people have been extremely receptive or this has been a a a great opportunity and I've been going door to door\nUm since you know last summer a summer of twenty Seventy and so uh I've had an opportunity to meet thousands of people\nYeah losing his owners is that a common concern that these families are having a out there was kind of what are they worried about these days yeah so you ... you know when you meet that many people you start seeing themes that arise 'em\nAgain you know a lot of it is town by town or just over the border of course uh your your listeners know above the water situation ... ... yeah I just came from knocking over there so that's why it's fresh in my mind\nUh but uh in Norton and we have severe water problems I Would say district wide um you know one of the the constant uh issues of senior citizens are feeling the squeeze property they need property tax relief a property values continue to increase\nAnd ah and many of them are on fixed incomes are so that's one of the issues that I think we're going to try and deal with uh in the next legislative session in January if I'm elected absolutely but schools you know schools are\nA an issue district wide statewide big priority for us\nUm local roads and train so our means of transportation that's obviously a huge issue here in the commonwealth a and a a we're going to need to fix it and bring it up to par for the twenty first century or if we want to come\nUh we're going to need to fix it and bring it up to par for the twenty first century or if we want to continue to have a thriving economy here so you know I Would say schools roads um\nTax relief for our seniors of course we support our veterans are public safety is a huge concern as well so these are some of the the broader themes I'd say of the campaign and the concerns of people\nYeah absolutely ... that's what I can kind of want to I think this is a good platform to kind of explains for listeners um what are the some of the current issues that are state faces as a whole and kind of a you know what would you want to change what would you want to bring to ah to our state\nYeah so you know my again my background is in finance um and\nI are also had the opportunity to serve on a local Finance Committee or in the town of darkness or I was probably one of the youngest folks and in town meeting so I have that ... base are similar to the governor and lieutenant governor and I think having that municipal finance background\nUm my campaign managers a Democrat um some of my top advisors are Democrats and independents um and uh I I think that's important bringing people together\nOh absolutely absolutely and it's good to see to see that your campaign is is it\nOh absolutely absolutely and it's good to see\nTo see that your campaign is is is involved in that but you guys recently had a debate to um the other day I was at seekonk right handed to you right TV to be a sort of like they give our listeners a chance to understand the differences\nBetween you and your opponent and one of the biggest ones are is immigration sure what's ... what's ... stance on immigration kind of how do you feel about it in general as as our state\nYeah so um again immigration is a a obviously a hot topic right now nationally and again my approach to immigration is to avoid the national noise on both sides and focus here locally and focus on things that we can control\nUm the biggest difference between me and my opponent um is probably an immigration a last year on may twenty third ah actually this year on may twenty third a few months ago or the Senate or during the budget debates slipped through\nAn amendment to the Senate budget um amendment\nOne one for seven which was essentially a sanctuary cities a sanctuary state amendment or they refer to it a safe communities are but regardless of the the title\nIt's semantics at the end of the day or this amendment or what are\nCalled for the prohibition of our local police are local sheriffs and our state police from a inquiring about an individual citizen citizenship status or when this individual was already apprehended so we're not talking about ratings people and\nYou know lifting people from the shadows and you know this is not about that this is about a public safety amendment and as far as I'm concerned I'm ... percent it did in my opponent voted for this was to prohibit our local law enforcement from inquiring\nThe Senate did in my opponent voted for this was to prohibit our local law enforcement from inquiring about a citizenship status I disagree with it um and uh I think most people in this district tend to agree with me that we should have a we should give our local law enforcement all the tools they need to keep our community safe\nUm this particular amendment which was a again ... amendment one one for seven to Senate bill for this was a senator Jamie Eldridge is amendment I'm\nDoug sanctuary cities are safe communities and um it went so far as do if a local police officer for example in Edinburgh officer at apprehended someone on a drug trafficking charge\nAnd inquired about citizenship status to cooperate with our state or federal authorities are that individual police officer would actually be a reprimanded and so I think that bill went too far away as extreme and um\nIt was so extreme that they were even six Democrats who joined the seven or Republicans in the Senate to vote against it now it automatically made it through the Senate or but then fails before it got to the house which is also Democrat control so that's how extreme it was and I think that's probably the biggest difference\nI'm One of a few issues between me and my opponent\nSure sure well let's get a let's get into the um\nThe all the issues of because I think it's a good way for them because the election is November six so it's right around the corner coming up and ... what are some of the other ones that you you feel\nAre you are pretty a different day as opposed to your views are against your opponent or some of the others are issues that you think are something that he he stands for a year just like nope not me yeah so he supports\nA single payer Bernie Sanders style healthcare system I don't um I Do support legislation that we've done in a bipartisan manner here in Massachusetts where we can continue to offer the world's best\nDone in a bipartisan manner here in Massachusetts where we can continue to offer the world's best healthcare and ... a continued to try and make advances in curbing the cost to make it more affordable I'm all for that of course a for seniors and veterans and working families and small businesses um I don't believe\nSingle payer is the way to go um it's a it's essentially a socialist plan or he supported it would cost the commonwealth on conservative estimates are thirty billion dollars and uh\nThere's no way to pay for it there's just no way a so that's a\nDifference between ... and I I'm an you know general economic a philosophy\nI was endorsed by the national federation of Independent Business a they represent thousands of small businesses across the commonwealth an over one million small business employees I'm I'm very pro small business and pro entrepreneurial ship 'em I think my background and finance lens\nThat perspective we're look you know you have a lot of small business owners are and start ups here in the commonwealth who are trying to just make it by you know they pay their taxes\nOr energy rates are through the roof healthcare is through the roof and the last thing we need is more a burdensome regulation or and or additional taxes um my opponent ah as for higher taxes more government spending um and\nUh the associated industries of Massachusetts uh they referred to as aim a gave him actually the lowest ranking of two hundred members of the legislature he's only been in there for eight months and he already has the lowest ranking for a business friendliness and the commonwealth so I\nThink immigration we differ\nCompletely and a a business or a relations I think we differ\nYeah absolutely it it's an issue because [noise] just the other day we were talking about an Arab rose kind of one of these places where that's so relevant you look at all the jewelry factors that\nTalking about an Arab rose kind of one of these places where that's so relevant you look at all the jewelry factors that we had at one point in this small businesses that were thriving and now it's just\nWhether jobs are going overseas or it's becoming a so strict on these businesses to to come here and what not so it's a I think that's a you know small business that's really in my opinion what kind of went makes a community so it's important to prioritize\nThem right and I think I think Adam ... right now um we are prime for great gross a we're located be a conveniently between Boston and Providence right here on I'd had five and the ah\nThe commuter rail or obviously as a state we have some transportation issues we need to address with both of those means of transportation but uh we've got a great downtown here I think it could be more bustling a more transit oriented um community here down near the\nUh the train station and also continue to keep the characteristics of the city that has made the city a great city over the last several decades and a beyond so\nYeah so we're a gateway city so there's also different opportunities for finance um funding to to really get in it because it's like you said we're in the middle of Boston in Providence and you also arrows a walkable place too you know what I mean from downtown even here we can ah you access tons of restaurants and different businesses\nBut already folks here in Studio Jacob ... who is a candidate for state Senate offer this coming election November six or we're gonna come back talk more about his platform I'm\nActually in some of the things he wants to see done and I'm just just as general background and whatnot so

sunset at six o'clock or eleven hours\nLebanon hours and so we get to enjoy eleven hours of the sun but as you were saying a very ineffective as we go through this month of October the sun low in the sky and that's why we're only going to reach the mid forties will have North West winds Fifteen to thirty five miles an hour now again the winner will tend to diminish as the afternoon wears on as the high pressure builds in but as that\nAgain the windows tend to diminish has the afternoon wears on as the high pressure builds in but at that go visit overhead it's going to be clear in cold tonight [noise] schools they will have that ever increasing bull and a temperature falling down into the upper twenties and low thirties\nA ... one of those nights and mornings where it'd be a wide variety of temperature up you're in a more rural location or you could be as low as twenty six twenty seven and a few down near the coast or\nA up on a high heel you could be thirty two but it's going to be cold everywhere with frost I highly recommend if you have tend to plan so vegetables are you trying to keep growing or you might want to take them into a cover them up at the very least\nA however we will have a nice recovery tomorrow sunshine high in the upper fifties\nAnd then suddenly clouds on Saturday just a quick shower a kind of like the other day when we had that the one or two showers through the day but much of the day was sending clouds\nAnd hiding a sixty on Saturday not bad however colder air booze and Saturday Night setting the stage for a chilly day on Sunday a little like today\nA high in the mid to upper forties and then Monday after starting out uh once again colds and the upper twenties lower thirties we should reach the forties Monday afternoon next week we're going to be monitoring again I what's going on well two hours south a with a stall front and that could generate some stormy weather here late next week but right now I think Tuesday looks good\nA son in clouds high in the fifties and\nUh the cooler weather will be back down for Wednesday again long range still looks like something going on late next week in terms of stormy weather whether it comes to ... go to our west or comes up along the coast\nProbably not purely tropical but some indications that about a week from now we could get into some stormy weather at least have the\nThreat of that going on now with the last afternoon late afternoon cold front of passage we did have a a tree down on a car at St Mary's church in North adult borrow a and again uh hopefully the person was okay also Elizabeth wrote and Fox\nUh and again the hopefully the person was okay also Elizabeth wrote and Fox poetry came down ... dog battle by our road if you know what that is in Cumberland a tree fell on a moving car hopefully they were okay a federal Newton parkway of taught in the tree came down and also a a ... down in ...\nI'm On caster hill road so again or some scattered areas of trees coming down a branches coming down with that cold final passage\nOr late yesterday afternoon drop the temperature about ten degrees at about fifty minutes and the whistle blowing leaves around things like that so again not the best of situations are late yesterday afternoon but at least that didn't last long\nI end this cold is actually not go in the last one either as we've kind of go up and down a with the uh warm and the cold and it's kinda typical as you go through October but the good news well today we're going to have the ... at least the sun shining all day a dorm Nineteen Seventy two\nWhat happened on this date ...\nNineteen Seventy two what happened on this date um God what had happened was today the Eighteenth of October uh I Would say something\nUnusual that's why I brought it up so there's the hint\nYeah okay um let's see Nineteen Seventy two what would be a weather related incidents that would happen on this day I'm ... ... ... Nineteen Seventy two well I Would probably would management is\nThey can't ... here's the hand here's another one for you and I talk if you think about it I've said this before and others uh the Seventy two Seventy three a seat and didn't have a lot of snow did not have much snow at all Nineteen Seventy two Seventy three\n... um so we ... well it was going to say we probably had the first uh flakes of snow in our area\nThat's right you are correct right a matter of fact we had more than a few flakes we got a couple two inches of snow in adults\nCorrect right a matter of fact we had more than a few flakes we got a couple two inches of snow in adult borrow\nOn this date in Nineteen Seventy two and everyone was all the snow lovers as I've said before\nA falsely were up up in a cheering and say this is going to be a great winter of snow I've got to make a lot of buddy plowing I'm going to be able to make a lot of snow man and know Seventy two in Seventy three we had about twelve inches of snow the entire season\nA and there's another case where in early snowfall often leads to not much to the season so uh once again if we were to get snow and the next couple of weeks or even flurries\nOr that bodes well for most people that don't like snow in the winter obviously we have never had a winter that has not spilled but in terms of getting a even a normal about which is about forty three inches a on average or in the ... area or that went to we had about twelve inches of snow the entire winter but two of it fell on\nOctober Eighteenth Nineteen Seventy two how 'bout that matter of fact in the elite terrain\nNorth situate Rhode Island four and a half inches of snow\nI could see I could see a ... round the getting getting that yeah I can see that definitely\nThe hilly terrain but any rate just to bring that up that uh\nSnowed on this date or but we will not ... it's cold enough to actually if there was precipitation Linda this dog uh it is it is snowing this morning in parts of New Hampshire and Vermont they had so showers in Lewiston, Maine\nUh let's see Springfield, Vermont and also Las ... New Hampshire so all three northern New England states that we're talking God not just the mountains but there are flurries now or that's why would they have a few scattered clouds throughout the day but that's about it the sun will shine\nA it is snowing now if you'd only went up in Lewiston, Maine Springfield, Vermont and ... New Hampshire up by lake went up a psyche they're getting flurries not melt it's melting as it hits the ground obviously but a snow showers in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont this morning and a few locations\nObviously but ah still showers in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont this morning and a few locations so again a cold air mess with the good news is going to be moving out of here and by tomorrow afternoon we'll be back up around that probably about fifty eight degrees in the afternoon\nI'm looking at the observation deck up mount Washington right now there is some snow flurries out there in fact a very cloudy but I can see it right now looking right at it\nI can see some white snow on the ground are up ... up on the deck there ah on the side entrances or to the deck up there as well\nAgainst the railings there the\nThe ... exactly yeah\nAnd it gets a little brighter there hopefully they'll stay out of the clouds would be able to see more than just about just about done with allowing people to just go up there on your own going off the auto and I think it I Want to say it might end\nIt might have just ended a think October Fifteen but uh\nYeah so that's an indication that dawn that a you know it's cold enough for snow obviously we have clear skies now here but ah if there were precipitation it would be the atmosphere is cold enough snow but\nAre not as much a threat of that as we had back in Nineteen Seventy two and again that's a classic example the as I've said to you and you remember that the earliest snow on record was October ninth and\nListening to W.

state representative Jim Hawkins who said opioid addiction is his top issue now reach speaker said that situation has become very critical\nWith nearly three uh three hundred people dying of overdoses last year in Brazil county alone\nIn fact the c._e._o. of the hospital rates alleging says right now we are in a crisis in our community our state and our nation she added that insurance companies need to better fund treatment programs so addicts can basically\nGet better care as well in fact she also says in fact in fact longer a stays in\nOh in fact she also says in fact in fact longer\nA

created a unit called pop the problem oriented apologizing and one of his duties is to visit families of overdose victims and tried to get them involved\nIn the victims recovery as well in fact the brother of state representative Jim Hawkins Dan Hawkins and founder of the clarion healthcare said medical research does offer some hope for the future but\nThere were no solutions coming in the new in the near term right now they do suggest schools have nurses and that led to train as monitor the painkillers taken by some of the injured students at least and explain to them the benefits of ice and also alleviating the ... body part as well in fact from the Brockton hospital then use\nA set emergency rooms said health care providers did help start the opioid problem by over prescribing some

raise the level of roads more gradually then speed bumps which are often found in some parking lots\nThose sounds are considered an effective way to force drivers to reduce the speed of their cars were speeding as a chronic problem man of course used by a number of communities throughout the state mayor also said he is also proposing new audience because speeding on some of the city streets is one of the biggest complaints that he's received by his officers well\nIn fact other ordinance sponsored by the mayor would impose parking restrictions on legal club road\nSome of those plaques up plastic shopping bags and also imposed penalties on drivers who actually smoke in their cars while they have a child in their cars as well all are in the committee but none have gone to the floor for a vote mass and those speed bumps are about as tall as those others speed bumps that are all backed out a wider\nLessening their impact as well [noise]\nWell the talking base has row is now planning

sixteen did involve teen drivers out teen drivers would everyone on the road at risk of a deadly crash especially if\nThey're bringing team passengers along for the ride well this is this has been ... you know talked about for many many years\nNew research from AAA did find that when a team driver has only team passengers in their vehicle\nFatality rate for all people involved is ... increased by fifty one percent now in contrast when older passengers thirty five or older ride with the teen overall fatality rate decrease nearly eight percent\nNow considering the increased risk created by a combination of teen drivers and team passengers\nAAA is inviting the teen and the need for teen drivers to gain adequate supervise training and specially in different driving scenarios before taking what could be possibly a fatal Dr\nWell back two years ago teen drivers were involved in more than one million police report it crashes resulting in more than thirty two hundred deaths\nNow researches pinpointed but when teens were carrying the teen passengers\nFatality rates jumped fifty six percent\nCarrying the teen passengers fatality rates jumped fifty six percent for occupants of other vehicles\nForty five percent for the team driver and Seventeen percent for pedestrians and people on bikes now here in Massachusetts back in twenty six team they were thirty three fatalities in crashes involving teen drivers\nTen were drivers eleven were passengers and six ... occupants of other vehicles and six were either pedestrians cyclists now this analysis shows that in crashes where teen drivers are behind the wheel with the teen\nPassenger the larger portion of those killed our other road users now this study also found a fatality rate of a teen drivers related ... related crashed increased when factors like speeding or driving at night\nWere first introduced well as I said supervised driving with parents in the passenger seat as the coach is right now the first step in teaching teens how to become responsible safe drivers what they are asked also offering you can go to teen driving dot triple A. dot com\nTo find out more about this saying required teens to live at least a hundred dollars a supervised practice driving with a parent before driving going out solo\nBegin by practicing driving in low risk situations and gravel gradually move to situations that are more complex nighttime highway driving and rain and on and around challenging roadways like curves\nAnd allow no more than one non family person under the age of twenty to ride with that teen\nDuring the maybe the first six months of driving also use slightly different routes each practice session and finally practice adjusting speed based on three factors visibility on road traffic and different road conditions\nSo as I said you can get more about this by going on\nRoad conditions so as I said you can get more about this\nBy going onto teen driving dot triple A. dot com to help coach these

culture like music like art your station covers sports at the high school level you're not talking brewers baseball for crying out loud\nYou're talking the local scene briefly sometimes other topics don't interest me but it's part of the fabric of the community just wanted to express my two cents that was closer to sixteen or Seventeen cents I think but I say I was in like a quarter yeah right right um [noise]\nWhat factor oh we have a question for you okay which ... which will get to in just a question or no no uh what factors determine a dog's life expectancy I have two Thirteen year old now while we have to ask agent six what breeds what kind of dogs are adding\nBut it's you know there there were so many factors\nThat determine that there's genetics is healthy lifestyle is diet um you know the the amount of medical care the dog gets a you know the generally speaking the larger the breed the shorter lifespan but that's even changing now we're seeing you know larger breed dogs living into their early to mid teens\nWell those are the dogs who are being fed earth foreign pet foods ice has because again Bob can say this but I Will if you're not feeding your dog earth born products um you're feeding them poison it's just that simple I'm aged sixty nine\nCent in a bunch of remote correspondence but these are actually worth reading I'm probably should have left his agent number out of this one but he's been very honest with us I just woke up watch the whole game then girlfriend decided she was frisky ooh [laughter] good for you\nThe whole game then girlfriend decided she was frisky ooh [laughter] good for you it genetics you know I'm not so good for her but I'm sure it was good for you uh went to sleep at two Fifteen am well and then back to the uh Nineteen Seventy five games six greatest game in baseball history according to Pete Rose\nAnd because normally I spent in the ground when they have to mention Pete Rose his name God what a horrible human being great baseball player and truly horrible human being um I had to get permission after ... home run\nIn the eighth inning yeah so we're already over anyway center tied the game up at six after the foul ball to stay alive for them terrible terrible swing and then sort of feel I had to get permission after ... home run to come back downstairs in Nineteen Seventy five to seize this to see Fisk blast in the twelfth\nAnd then and then agents sixty nine writes in an agent sixty nine um I had this highlighted in the newspaper yesterday I had a circled in big letters because I wanted to talk about it and I didn't get to it\nOr the last hour of yesterday's show was almost like a real talk show here it was like political ... going back and forth uh two two calls going back and forth on political stuff I don't do real talk show stole stuff much was very odd for me but um this is\nI'm no sports Regina Pizzeria was named the number one pizza joint in the country number one of the country ... someplace in New York came in second someplace in New haven came in third\nRegina Pizzeria a thin crust brick oven who does the noodles and ... of toppings or what's your favorite pizza I don't have a pizza I never met a pizza I didn't like oh okay yeah All right I'm more of a deep dish guy or thin crust when I Will rest okay I like them both you know\nWe can terriers by the way the Thirteen year old dogs or we can terriers\nWe can terriers by the way the Thirteen year old dogs are Wheaton terriers yeah they're they're a smaller dog yeah OK the best dog ever born that was girl the dog guard dog she was a west highland terrier\nJust give them one or the other I'm I'm a\nAccess to hear your answer because all of the above all right because we go to the dog we used to mix some of the wet yeah dry\nAnd that I mean it it makes it maybe a little more interesting for the dog is enhanced palate ability\nUm if if the dog is content with a dry and uh the dry yeah you know I'm the only time I really recommend wet food\nIs um if if you don't know how much the dog is drinking and you want to be sure that hydrated okay because let food is Seventy percent moisture um and uh it's a ... such that he has to eat the soft wet food but other than that you know there's really no advantage\nTo wet food over dry or you know than the dry food and a lot of people say well it it it scrapes their teeth really doesn't\nCause they will take a mouthful to chopping to swallow and don't chew it yeah you know it's just it's just the chopping swallow but what it does do is to promote saliva flow and that tends to wash everything down to throw when you feed the wet food that doesn't promote\nAnd that tends to wash everything down their throat when you feed the wet food that doesn't promote the saliva flow and tends to stick to their teeth okay and then again you know within like Ninety six hours it can be plaque which will turn into tartar\nHuh oh and I'm here's where we go into um the difference between dog taste buds and human taste buds and for all of you people out there who are so concerned with the flavor of your dogs food\nYeah yeah the dogs that practically no sense of taste\nWe know and he was known science we know them on that I Will run or tongue of there's they've only got about Seventeen hundred and taste buds on are struggling a little town we have almost ten thousand ...\nWhen you offer something to a dog they invariably sniff it yeah and if they take gets the chopping swallow yellow to dissolve in their mouth\nI'm to enjoy the flavor ... and and the big the big thing is um they wouldn't get dessert out all the cats litter box if they had a sense of taste and they wouldn't let themselves where they looked themselves in that sense of taste probably you know wow [noise] so but it's you know\nThe advertising wouldn't be as as effective as you said the great smells dogs love the way to Rome and so we all talk about the great taste dog stuff 'cause we identify with taste when that's really not a factor which taste I mean the ... and sometimes texture you know the dog will take in his mouth and won't feel right to them and spit it out\nThat happens on occasion but generally if if it doesn't fight back it's gone\nAnd the guy and then um what we were going to talk about when we came back from our last break I completely forgot now that are in that short term memory law degree every\nThe grain free controversy you know the the the big confusion over the grain free issue when the dilated cardiomyopathy um that I tell you the FDA came out with an alert back in July on July twelfth they should know alert um for a dog so I'm a show\nTo an alert um for a dogs I'm showing up with cardio dilated cardio my op at the OK I'm Dalai the cardio my apathy is is an enlargement of the heart or it makes it a difficult for the heart to pump blood\nSo you know the various organs and so forth get oxygen starved for one thing or the valves can leak\nAnd that can cause a floor built up in the chest and abdominal cavity is leading to um congestive heart failure so I mean it's a it's a pretty serious a condition and there are some large in giant breed dogs that are\nAre genetically predisposed to getting that um that condition [laughter] um but in the past year or so or they didn't really give a timeframe\nUm they have been small and medium sized dog showing up at that ordinary cardiologist with DC I'm Down there the cardio biology a puppy and uh so USDA FDA took a look at it\nAnd um you know the the information right now it's still very sketchy they're still collecting data ... you know from all over the country wants to send got an ounce and everybody you know oh I I my dog is this and my dog is that so they're\nThey're just collecting and analyzing data but I'm the one thing that they found there was a common thread was that um a lot of dogs run grain free diets\nThat had um peace I mean that potatoes and legumes huh as a main ingredient\nNow there's no regulatory or legal definition of a main ingredient ... what you what the FDA uses a to define a um an ingredient of a main ingredient is those ingredients that appear on the ingredient panel before the first vitamins mineral\nVitamins and minerals that usually those things you can't pronounce [laughter] because where we are required by law to use to scientific name um\nBecause we're we're required by law to use to scientific name um for the same reason I've I've I've said this before um when when people plant new to new plant things in the yard you're safe the tags that come with those plants because they get the tax anonymous name that that big long Latin Amy camps\nInterest rates on AM Thirteen twenty W. A. R. A. of more of a kid with Paul ended up north Carolina I'm next to Ken Brown university who hosts the lecture error shot oh I'm Sorry Bob\nYou were saying oh are they going to go to the breaking girls break I Want you to finish your thought gosh darn okay well as I say [laughter] ... so great for good or bad\nYeah well I mean grain free has always been a little more marketing and sign yeah dogs have no nutritional requirement for carbohydrates which what the grains are the main purpose of the grains is um as a binding agent to help all the cable together\nPeople think of them is Phil is there are no fillers and pet foods okay everything has a purpose to may not be nutrition but everything has a purpose\nAnd and what we consider to be the lower end foods you see a lot of corn wheat soy sorghum gluten things like that that can affect the digest ability of the food produced gas softer stools more volumes tools and can ah can affect the dogs' skin you know dry skin out and\nMake them scratch in the in the higher end foods that youth grains will use all meal rice barley and rye um those aren't problematic grains and then in the grain free we use a binders life he's potatoes tapioca\nSo that's why you see 'em a lot in the grain free um but there are there are a foods and aren't green free but also have potatoes and tapioca and ah so anyway that's you know the FDA came up with this warning and of course social media just lit up and I mean that\nThat gives things or a life of its own everything gets you know gets blown way out of proportion even FDA's position at this point\nGets blown way out of proportion even FDA's position at this point is don't change your dogs die based on the information we've gotten so far 'cause it's inconclusive okay right now it's just it's just a it's a common thread ... um\nAnd then you know other other questions came up well what if it says sweet potatoes Yukon Gold red potatoes\nPotatoes or potatoes throughout the taste [laughter] okay um and then that as an aside they mentioned that I'm touring deficiency is another a significant cause of DC yeah\nWell that took on a life of its own as well Torino to fit shoring yeah touring as an essential amino acids and a touring deficiency can lead to blindness and it can lead to the dilated cardio money off of the um the retina can break down or if there's not enough touring\nSo that took on life his own people looking at that pet food label for touring and often times and the dog food anyway you know what I'm saying yeah you don't see it because dogs can synthesized tore my people can\nDogs I'm going to pressure with this okay dogs take the amino acids messiah name a Seventeen almost empty and sent ten to combine together to form touring er which becomes a significant um element of bio\nAnd there's the ... solves a approached the exit in a small intestine\nThe um the touring in the ... um gets it gets a created and read absorbed so that's how they make their own their own touring\nSo you don't need to add that I'm at earth born and we have always supplemented was touring or our dog food because we understand that there was largely giant breed dogs that are predisposed to DC I'm so we want to support them\nYou don't have to have to arena does the cat you do yeah 'cause cats can't synthesize touring they have to get it from the diet huh\nCat you do yeah 'cause cats can't synthesize touring they have to get it from the diet and the only sources of Torino or meat and shellfish you can't get Tori and from you know from plant protein or anything like that\nThere goes the vegan diet for your cat\nYou know and I'm so that you know that that created more confusion because people didn't see tore arenas several unit dog food\nUm ingredient bill and so I mean it it it really has gotten blown out of out of proportion I've covered it a couple of times so far in the in the column and on the on the hub pages website in fact I just I just wrote one last night that I published on a on a page website\nAnd and I keep up on it you know has a new information becomes available\nBut right now it's it's really much ado about nothing because they don't know I mean they suspected maybe potatoes ... could have a you know be part of the issue but they don't know why that don't know that it is that just have to be something you know a common thread\nIn those um in those cases of DC I'm\nOK Bob amber is where this year will be was too about uh ten thirty yep okay Bob amber is with is the author of pets aren't people call them every Monday in the sun chronicle he is way wicked smart if you've got any questions for Bob about your pets\nOr give us a call five oh wait two to one three to zero five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty or text me it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine four we'll be right back after this and Thirteen twenty W.\nA.

in some some tolerated fine yeah you know I I'll see them this time of year in the pet stores and they came in and they they got the costumes on and they they do look you yeah um but some dogs just you know\nYeah we did it with a dog once you ... it was a little thing you put over to make a looked like a dragon yeah lasted about thirty seven seconds she wanted nothing to do with it\nYeah I had never put it on her again I'd let the dog determine you know yeah I mean you know if you're going to force it on for a for a quick photo shoot for a minute or two yeah that's one thing but that to force them to you know take him to a doggy event or family party or something like that dressed up when they don't want to be dressed up that's not\nFair exactly you know what costume or I'm going to wear this Halloween I'm going to dress up as a mature adult [laughter] nobody will recognize me nobody speaking of mature adults let's go to the phone lines and speak to the world's most amazing meteorologist Jim carbon yeah\nWell that's very kind of you'll live to see another day of that I guess but [laughter] it's all good morning Bob Hi Jim uh I have a couple of questions right at the end if I can ask well get right to the weather and Bob it's a question that you asked me a couple of years ago they actually take place tomorrow morning remember the question you asked about the temperature\nYeah why it it goes down when the sun rises the temperature goes down you\nKnow not most\nWhen the sun rises the temperature goes down you\nNot not most David doesn't put tomorrow morning we'll be I think the classic example of that now today as I like to call it an example of mental wild weather almost six months to the day April nineteenth\nI was the last time we had the temperature is only reach the middle forties during the day it rained it rained all day April nineteenth almost exactly six months ago\nA and so this is something we haven't seen in six months at least the sun is shining though but\nAnother indication of the ever weakening signed the shadows continue to get longer each day the sun comes in the window in the morning at a different angle and it's set so we all know in the west but now it's sitting in the west southwest of the coming into the different angles all these go as we go through the shorter days of the year to cause it's that angle of the sun that really affects the temperature\nOr average high on this date of sixty out which is very similar to uh the last few days of April and that's kind of makes sense that we have had we getting weather kind of like mid to late April that coming up\nOver the next day or so now they reached the mid forties today we're going to drop off this afternoon so if you want to fly a kite do it this morning we have a better chance of going up because a window diminished but that will set the stage for the certainly the coldest morning of the season in terms of the actual air temperature now\nAlabama or on the Senate only dropped to about thirty six thirty seven this morning but the wind was blowing at fifty miles an hour on average and we had the windshield and the twenties tomorrow morning we'll have almost no wind radiation will cooling\nAnd we're going to have a white frost on the grass in many areas\nAre outside of the more urban locations because the temperature is going to get close to the point we're going down around twenty nine or thirty\nSo it will be colder temperature wise tomorrow morning pot or they will be almost no wind so in some cases some people would almost take that now the thing about the temperature again Bob in all yep we had one night when the steel the temperature is usually taken about five or six feet above the ground the official temperatures\nWhen the steel the temperature is usually taken about five or six feet above the ground the official temperatures I have at the monitor on the laying right on the on your back yard Grasso wherever a not on the pavement because it'll be ... ah on the grass the temperature could easily be five degrees cooler\nRight at the bottom and that's why people have asked me and other forecasters how can I get frost if it's like thirty six degrees well the process forming right off the ground\nSo uh and I've done it many times as a as an experiment in the past and showing people saying to saint the monitors it always ... to like\nPut one on like a ladder six feet above the ground on a nightly tonight and lay the other one just on the ground\nAnd the one on the ground or will be at least five sometimes six seven degrees colder and that's why you get the frost\nBottom line is we're going to see a nice ... nice recovery tomorrow afternoon into the middle to upper fifties back closer to that sixty what we should be were losing about a degree every two and a half days now through the temperature average temperatures and that a good news for the weekend signed clouds just a quick passing shower probably late afternoon another cold frontal approach\nAnd we'll spike up to about sixty so there we go back to average\nAnd then Sunday very similar to today windy cold in the forties\nI'm like today though I think there'll be a little more on the way of those are the Louis clouds mixed with the blue skies Indy\nSo we can picture that Sunday by the way the patriots in case you're interested in Chicago last Sunday afternoon they will be on the back side of the high so they're going to be playing and sunshine and about sixty degrees in Chicago on Sunday afternoon so and luckily it's a one o'clock game so he doesn't get sleep\nAs God herself intended football at one o'clock on Sundays two things quickly um ah they were clown questions last night on Jeopardy Jim oh really well yes asked\nMe asked me one of them see if I can get\nUm the top of some cumulus cloud looks like the handle bingo they don't want to [noise] [noise] right yeah\nLike and do\nBingo there in that one right yeah\nAnd ... and then whenever anyone uses the word and bill or a CNN ville I immediately think of um the road runner and Wylie coyote genius boy they went through a ton of bills in their skill at all of the\nCompany it was made by acme anyway I oh yeah well no envelope under storms to worry about hopefully for the rest of the year as we were pretty much out of our thunderstorm season next chance\nHold on hold on hold on hold on I I yeah last time we talked about Wylie coyote genius and the road runner I asked where did you get the money to order all the acme products\nAnd I was really stunned by this and the ... one of our quality control engineers wrote in he doesn't need money to purchase those products it's an advertising technique called product placement\nAct me was willing to give Wylie coyote genius all of those products for free because so many of us would see the acme products on the cartoons while now you were trying to talk about the weather or something\nThat I always thought that was like it's like the generic brand in let's say from the sixties you know ... you know but uh yeah you know and and and all the TV shows you see when they have a bottle of ... a hot enough milk\nWith what you don't see those anymore cartons of milk but are they always just had milk on them or not all the time it was just really no brand you know so anyway that's what I was trying to say what the next chance of rain\nKnow where they got that information it's welcome back to the pontificated with Paul and Bob ... show right now here at Thirteen twenty W.

I'm a dog mom during the day my dog is in daycare but the nights present more of a challenge I work full time and I'm Single but I still choose to have a dog because of the proven emotional and\nFitness benefits that correlate to owning four legged friends\nLately I've been wondering whether my dog can come along with me in a typical settings such as Bible study\nTo hair dressing appointments and to other venues that are not conspicuously dog friendly I live in Denver and our city is extremely dog friendly but I fear the culture here could be desensitizing me to what is otherwise unacceptable social behavior\nI have a healthy view of an animal's place in the world versus the humans so it\nActually use the term pet it gets wound up like you do man but anyway um I have a healthy view of animals place in the ...\nTrump advocates will think you'd do man but anyway um I have a healthy view of animals place in the world versus humans she does so I Do not want to display bad manners to my two legged friends by imposing my four legged friend upon them what's the appropriate ...\nAs the owner of the still I mean come on [laughter]\nYou know I wouldn't have thinking person just do that you know for the Bible study group do send an email make a phone call yeah kind of bring my dog right yeah no you can okay and then don't argue you know if they said oh don't argue right just but they know who who else in the group but an allergy younger you know\nThe fears you know um but then\nThe the thing that got me though is this is someone who thinks thinks they have a healthy respect for the difference between dogs and humans um I'm Sorry you don't you don't and I and you know what a terrible person I'm not trying to say that\nBut uh you're wrong or Bob amber I mean a Amy you'll love the first I'm not going to be ... or ...

I Know you don't yeah um when you did did your dog sleep in your bed\nI never had a dog had a cat and yes she did really yup you've never had a dog never had a dog but you had cats\nReally yeah you've never had a dog never had a dog but you had cats\nYeah had a cat she was born Bob I have a lot of this I hate to do this I think I'm going to have to ban you pontificate and with Paul show [laughter] wow kittens I guess it and not cats yeah my only the one who said you're the one who said dogs are family cats think your staff yeah\nYeah but she was born I named her fluffy she was born behind my chair and my office at the old barn and when she got to be eight weeks I took her home I was single the times yeah she was company for me and he lost his sixteen years wow\nWow Asian Seventeen writes in Bob's right pets are not people but my pets make me feel better than most people do yeah yeah that's a common common sentiment him they don't talk back and there's been all kinds of just having a dog yeah lowers your blood pressure lowers your heart rate yeah all kinds of there's all kinds of\nBenefits and the fact is an organization called the human animal bond research Institute it's ha be our eye that a fund research into this type of thing you know the the human animal bond yeah the benefits of pet ownership to to humans and so a lot of lot of research being done on that\nThere was an amazing study I saw on PBS about dogs a couple of years ago um where they were trying a it was this was out of a a Russia and they were trying to domesticate wolves\nSo there'd be a a family of wolves and they select only the most gentle or ... file\nWolves and it only took them for generations for generations to come up with wolves that they have much more like dogs and then like wolves and yeah and they expected it to take like Fifteen or sixteen generations amazing but dogs they started his walls right\nYeah and there's there's some controversy about that um you know\nSwells right yeah and there's been some controversy about that um you know the dogs get get domesticated when wolves to our hanging around the campfire scraps of the eyes\nYou know the the the people would throw the scraps of food out to them so they wouldn't eat the people you know [laughter] and uh and and that's where it came from but you know the central he talked to\nOkay um [noise] I met a tongue in cheek that I might not invite you back but now it's starting to consider the seriously agents seventeenth with me all my God he's never had a dog\nYou know my interest in animals has always been scientific then he can find a scientific perspective not a wow not an emotional than he can't say pets are people I'm not going to go that far I think he's still said oh yeah I mean that that that makes it easier for me to say\nThat while I'm okay and then agent five Ninety five writes in ... six Ninety nine right exactly right Bob very wow\nI'm tired too I'm not really lost and I might steal that yeah by the way it was soon as you leave the studio you're going to engage in on my favorite activity is living really humidity and the inside to my island yes you will you're taking a nap yeah napping used to be third on my list but I'm sixty years old now and it's number one\nI kind of way and I'm so glad this is almost over with [laughter]\nAnd drive more like Tom Rath dirty in a relaxed manner for Tom and this this we have talked about a little for Tom\nDriving is a relaxing activity he's not in a rush he's not always looking at a clock he doesn't leave for late work a leaf work late so we have to rush Tom is one of those rare individuals in God I Wish I was like this were driving\nIs a relaxing activity for most of us driving is a stressful activity we're trying to get somewhere and damage we want to get there now the exceptions are\nMy loving daughter grace did this summit with Kim but this was much more of a a grace and dad thing um mystery writes we still do it to this day but from the time\nShe was a little girl you know just when she was old enough to make her own mix CDs or ... you know I Would go on mystery rides put a a mix CD and the CD player listen to the music would introduce songs to each other and just uh whenever we got to an intersection\nWhichever way we didn't know did not know which way that road went we take that road\nAnd we usually drive very relaxed very slow and that that's one of the only times in my life were driving was relaxing a relaxing activity and not as stressful activity but to make sure we didn't cause stress for other drivers\nWhen we were taking it slow relaxing mystery ride and someone came up behind me we would poll over we pull over now we're both happy we're both happy\nAll over we pull over now we're both happy we're both happy\nI don't have some impatient jerk riding the rare bumper of my car\nAnd he doesn't have some slow polka holding them up he's got somewhere to go we would pull over let cars by I mean four five six seven times on our mystery rights everyone's happy everyone's happy and and\nSome people do this even some people close to me do this so I Will not use their names or someone comes up behind them on a road and starts tailgating all get them back so they slow down even more\nDon't do that don't do that really ... wow wow you think they're being a jerk by\nYou know writing to close do tailgating you Idaho I Know the solution I'll do what Trump would do if someone's being a jerk to me I'll be a bigger jerk up figure jerk\nNo oh who knows maybe there's an emergency [noise]\nMaybe they forgot their wife's anniversary and they're desperately trying to get to the store and get her present wife's anniversary their anniversary or wife's birthday and they're desperately trying to get to get get to a store to get a president before she finds out\nThat he forgot the birthday or anniversary maybe it's a medical emergency someone's tailgating you\nAnd you have room or there's a safe place to do it by saying do it right away but at the next day\nFor opportunity pull over let him get by your both happier you're both happy or you don't have some jerk tailgating you\nAnd while they don't have some slow polka holding them up anyway other ...\nOther ordinances proposed by the mayor would impose parking restrictions on Beagle club road bed\nWould impose parking restrictions on Beagle club road ban thin plastic shopping bags and impose penalties on drivers who smoke in their cars when they have a child in the car seat that one I'm not in favor of\nI'm In favor of trying to educate people that you shouldn't be smoking gas spurs when your kids in the car seat in the back seat I don't want to pass laws on that stuff\nUm that's kinda like um\nIf someone ... ever asked me what my political leanings are now usually mentioned that while I'm consider myself a progressive I'm a proud progressive but I'm not a gym rowdy kind of progressive and if he ever see Jim rowdy on his show greater Boston or hear him on the radio with Marjorie Egan\nOn one of the NPR stations a gym is the kind of progressive who wants to ban everything wow wow I still kind of believe in freedom of choice cigarettes are legal\nYou know I'm someone wants to smoke\nAnd I guess I'm almost libertarian on that kind of stuff I mean I don't use excessive sugar someone else does fine I think so to is poison poison I tell you\nI'm I don't want to ban it I don't want to ban the giant cops I don't want to ban stuff I Want to educate people and then let them make their own decision and that's where the penalties on drivers who smoke in their cars when they have a child in the car seat um I think it's a good idea not not\nTo be puffing on gas ... when your kids in the car seat but I don't want to make laws about it but just I guess the general point I'm getting at took your while okay to take me to want to get to the point\nI'm Sorry but George roads in this article um\nLet me read just that first paragraph again but read it with the tone that I think George roads is implying I could be wrong but I think\nGeorge roads is implying I could be wrong but I think\nI think his tone is more like this\nMayor Paul hero is added again the city's chief executive but apparently he also loves the law making role he left the state legislature when he became mayor\nThis week he submitted the fourth fourth I tell you proposed ordinance of which he and he alone is the sole sponsor\nIs that tone correct\nDo you want your marriage just sit back shut up and run the city and have people have been problems to him or or do you like the fact that mare hero is being pro active and when he sees a problem he tries to propose an ordinance to solve said problem\nIn some cases uh I'd agree with them I think the plastic ban plastic bag ban is fine with that in other\nCases the um speed bumps and the um\nIf you smoke in your car with a child in the car seat we will a risk you actually they'll just find you they wanna rescue does those things go too far\n\nSo do you agree with George roads I think I think I'm guessing here but I think hey hey hey look out your mayor and not a state rap let other people boroughs audiences for or\nAre you glad that you're ... is being that proactive hey I see a problem there I've got an idea of how to fix that city council what do you think a couple of remote correspondence it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six\nYou eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for ... hold on\n\nWhich this um him doesn't drive her is probably a maniac in her white jeep Cherokee\nOh okay sorry this is the point of that now I get it oh freedom of choice by ... yes when we're talking about that when we're talking about that yeah so I I'm I Am a progressive but unlike a gym rowdy I'm not a huge fan of banning things\nI'm up up up up up\nAnd then I think we have another remote correspondence at seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for age in thirty one right smoking in the car with a child in the car is child abuse\nOkay\nThat's probably accurate some people might think that statement goes too far but that's probably accurate um I think I Want to educate people this child abuse I'm not sure I Want to pass a law about it\nUm and then by extension agent thirty one um [noise]\nDidn't see a lot of obese children when we were kids we didn't see a lot of obese children the fat kid always stuck out the fat kid always got picked on a while ago when I saw the movie to serve would love to serve with love Lulu city poor TA I cried during that movie to uh the kid in that movie they call fats\nWouldn't even be considered fat by today's standards um so\nWouldn't even be considered fat by today's standards um so you think smoking with a child in the car is child abuse um\n\nI got to be careful because I'm going to really really anger some people I think when I say this um [noise] I think having a five six seven eight year old kid a kid that young who's already obese I think that's child abuse too I really really do\nI Want to try to educate people about that I don't want to pass a lot about that I don't want to take take the kid away but um you know you walk through the mall and um\n[noise] a young kid that overweight wow wow I don't think it's bland ... I really do um\nOh OK aged forty eight um I think that was the last mayor agent forty eight not\nNot the current one not that there's anything wrong with that either way and then an anonymous texture rights and yes I think you got George roses George roads tone right yes the tone of that article was correct um I guess a a texture or remote correspondent\nHey you know I'm listening to talk of all the all the different changes and rules and stuff like that you know it's kind of ... ad in a way because there's so many laws so many rules regulations I mean pretty much you know far as when it comes with us You're an adult\nYou know you should know right from wrong and you know you do not to do and stuff like that and then as far as like these or what have you on a college but he bombshell whatever yes well we got more than enough of those in the city of out of her with\nWith all the potholes and stuff like that I think that we ought to be thinking is taking the money and try to upgrade a lot of the ... oh you know I mean that's just\nMy opinion I mean yeah a lately they've done you know pleasant as three self main street focus street it's still a lot of those that are really a tough shape so if you need a speed up your down Ninety five percent of those other roses funniest evolves [laughter]\nThat's yeah when I whenever you I hit a bump in your car you have to wonder was that a speed bump or a pothole\nYeah [laughter] after what people want to know what the differences and then that would be like well the same thing if they put these things through you know somebody has to do something damage to their vehicle and ... whatever the city solicitor lawyer and they'll be up an issue and get money and stuff like that so\nLike I said I I think we can use money or what was a a better use violence like I said upgrading the roads and doing other things and stuff like that\nExcellent All right um and just back to your first point um yeah it's an adult wants to smoke it off their back but I can see the point where you know you want to put smoke in your own body that's just fine I'm forcing it into a child's body um I can see I can see\nForcing it into a child's body um I can see I can see how that really really angers and aggravates some people because the kid doesn't have any choice about it\nNo apps and like I said once again you're an adult you should know that are not\nFunny at shows I mean it's like my daughter she smokes right but he doesn't do it uh when she said that car with the children\nYou know at the same thing if she wants to do it right there she's\nAt our house and lab and a couple of other stuff like that show the whole you know always where the children are not and so once again you know of all you know you know\nThat you all know and right from wrong you know like I said you know better not to do it on a children excellent points when you've got to have a law you know ticket is so on a cellphone right\nAll right hey oh Dan thank you so so much for calling in its eleven o two time from our Lebanon embrace who I got to give me the bombs Russians they get the hell out of here you're always\nGiven above average I hey did text me your email you mean your address or are they going to beat the Sunday deadline\nProblem are worried about it take care of\nAll I'm not either but ...

so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is skewed\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity would require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nWe had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down um\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making is what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question legitimacy of our electoral process these and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process sitting on top of this one undermines that um\nOf the election process not sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian Kemp the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor ...

of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist troop um that's in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques\nThe secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nA and because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of sudden or either closing of all places or shifting the ... voting place it from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision in twenty Thirteen\nHorton got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty six teen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may uh approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it\nEight hundred and sixty eight polling places where shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian Kemp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they consolidated the polling stations the one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states\nSo for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community but\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to be pressed the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nTrade Kim has unfortunately built two very strong record of voter suppression\nAnd yes he and I have\nTo leave a conflict at a number of times and\nI think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating of forcing him to restore the cancelled registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary can to end with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or forum of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking on ... about her opponent churches secretary of state Brian Kemp in Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia and\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student tried to ask\nHim about his endorsement\nSo ah how can you endorse a candidate film I probably want to be one of the\nSenator Purdue return the phone after student demanded it back on Sunday produced office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants and shit\nIt produces office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him I'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on that front as we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who's voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place by what's happening in Georgia\nI'm so first on I'm senator ... do you know remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is um by praying for Obama's death\nBy saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song and you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue\nUm and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian\nKemp and Casey cable has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety ah and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component\nFor why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the the I I'm not sure how how risk it has been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations had been very active\nAnd getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams in ... has a a message of hope has a message of how the we build in Georgia for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side\nJoke for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republican I'm because the demographics are changing so much in Georgia that the vote the vote for African Americans Asians and Latinos has to be stuff down because\nThe message that the uh Brian Kemp and the Republicans are bringing aren't messages that resonate with that population because those populations are in fact targeted by that their message\nAnd Carolyn Anderson share of African American studies department at Emory University author of well most recently one person no vote voter suppression is destroying our democracy will be back with her and other guests in a moment [noise] [noise]\nA because I'm having a felony conviction sent me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes in enjoys bipartisan\nSupport we're not leading where the partisan nature of of this topic or or the issue of voting what we're leaving with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize that that selling\nAnd because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that selling disenfranchisement now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign that we haven't brace and we all onto\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity and because of that we've been able to get people\nThat that that that that throw off their part of the same clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other and knowing that wants to desert space it's paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice and throwing the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing here I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discord\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAble to move from Florida to another uh another state\nAri I'd like to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also\nA a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer a the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate you're talking about that as well\nSo the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that but this ... written to not allow\nPO box as count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans couldn't be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I date and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be different\nWith strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost Heidi Heitkamp percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm elections absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour if the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as\nA Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas the name Pocahontas that's a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage an ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the ... presidential election\nJust imagine Amy voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her ancestry is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and now right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchise thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to vote for this law was sick\nDo everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea is they need to vote for this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerica ... an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election is but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to or have some I\nHave a have these folks have their rights a vote on before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very foreign people know that they can vote\nIn North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have basically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty a teen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different in twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen well we want to thank you\nTwenty if all of these ballot
