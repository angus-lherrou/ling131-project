glory Jemma foundation and had a great resource and breast cancer awareness um health fair\nAnd they had over forty five vendors there which was really phenomenal and um I always I got a beautiful scarf and a T shirt and stuff and talked to many folks and a two agencies to that offer free mammography he's\nSo um this is they're bringing forth you know may I'm Sorry October may a fast forwarding here\nThey're uh they're bringing in October as breast cancer awareness\nStay up fast forwarding here they're ah they're bringing in October\nAs breast cancer awareness month and I'm so everything is about um that and uh there are a great resource for you if you need a mammogram and can't afford it if you have breast cancer and newly diagnosed and need rights to treatments\nAnd also for support they have a great support system in place so um that was really well worthwhile going to I have to say and um\nThe greater Arab rural area sports is in full gear soccer teams are\nRunning all around the fields and uh and hazel team finally won a game yesterday so um I have some things that are pretty interesting I don't know female I'm a member on Wednesday did you get a presidential alert or yeah I mean that\nTo me or am I going to jump on for us and they said as rumors that that's\nThe way the president can or the government can control a cell phone cameras and\nHere's the thing I don't I don't like\nI thought it was such an invasion of privacy and if you do to call us at five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty 'cause it was like I I mean I'm pretty well informed and everything and I kinda read a little blurb about that you know there was going to be this alert from FEMA now I think with the president like ours\nAh he's going to tweet out like these alerts [laughter] that's what I'm just afraid of you know so he's just won presidential alert that's going to be coming out missing person alert first lady Melania Trump is missing\n[noise]\nSo I'm just saying that that's what that's what's gonna happen I think that he's just gonna abuse that\nI Wonder if he's going to do and he goes with which we like the alert like every emotion or everything he wants to say most\nPeople yeah he will that's what I'm\nAlert like every emotion or everything you want to say most people yeah he will that's what I'm afraid of I'm going to get buzz at three AM and saying oh you know I got pissed off at somebody and and this is what happened and no I really did have more people\nAt my whatever state dinner than ... or ... or something something stupid harassment\nLet me tell you folks if there's going to be a national disaster and I get a presidential alerts saying like you know we're going to be under attack or something like that I won't have time to change I Would [laughter]\nI mean what do you dress up how do you prepare for a national disaster you know what I'm saying it's like I just say you know bringing the rain okay I mean really seriously if we really going to be under attack in that\nI just figure you know what the heck I mean it's gonna happen\nI don't need somebody to alert me because then I'll be like tents and I don't have any chance I Want to be relaxed at the end of my time on the child was sixty for God's sakes you know I mean she is really the end of the world's coming okay fine you know accept it I mean jeeze I don't need to have a presidential\nAlert and saying I press the button [laughter]\nSo\nThat's all I'm going to say about that state you know more to come\nOver there might make me cry so odd that's my job to make everybody feel good is this just calms I don't know where it comes to just come\nAnyway I don't know about you about a purchasing mattresses is like buying a car or like I say it's like ...\nSummer too soft summer too hard and some are just right well I'm not just from is filing for bankruptcy and a no wonder so here's\nThe thing so I read about this and as a journalist I Want to say what the heck is going on here why are they really you know filing for bankruptcy\nAnd what the heck is going on here why are they really you know filing for bankruptcy and all this well you know what they did they took over this monopoly of of mattress it was like the mattress wars\nAnd then they bought out all these stores I mean they they bought so many like matches from flood up like a I mean everything all the stores so this is what happened\nSo the thirty two year chain had been struggling because they over expanded that's for one they purchase sleep base members sleeping in two thousand sixteen and matches giant and two thousand twelve\nSo the company has so many stores in close proximity to one another okay so they're eating up each other sales so that's one of the reasons right [noise] so and now that Amazon you know is expanded you can buy mattresses although I Would never do that 'cause\nI Love him with him when I got some great music playing and Mike is on and I guess that anyway and\nWhen I talked to a gym today and talking to us about this weather I mean I Know that follows your time and change the man is a cone so good morning Jim how are you having a sweater on\nYeah good morning Elaine how are you\nI'm doing great gosh it was forty eight degrees is money my V. ac held trial guarantee I've seen my breath\nYour breath you know\nWe were actually saved about three three o'clock this morning by a few clouds that would have actually been even colder had a few of those clubs come in but I don't know if you notice the cup some colors in the sky this morning\nA little bit of pink sit in a red and orange is ah with some of these high class so well it is a little cooler up there but this little colorful in sky in some areas this was the coolest morning since the first of may how 'bout that so we've got to go back a little over five months to get temperatures this cool or wherever the good news is if you don't\nLike this uh although it we haven't had too much of it so you really can't complain\nWe don't see any more really chilly nights until maybe the late next week so\nThat is something that it will be a change in just a little bit but we've got more great weather on tap as you would expect in the month of October we've got sunshine just a few of these high clouds of this morning and we're going to reach the mid sixties\nThis afternoon also yet again the farmers' market goes off with no weather issues and everything else going on outside today or they get well last night at the high school football games for weather nice crisp and cool and uh that's the way it will be today now tonight it'll fall back ah probably somewhere to the mid fifties so not certainly has has coolest\nOh back ah probably somewhere to the mid fifties so not certainly isn't as cool as the forties that's we have this morning but still cool enough certainly good sleeping whether we're not really worrying too much about that anymore and then it's still looks like a land the warmest day for the holiday weekend this includes of course Monday Columbus\nDay is tomorrow as the winds will turn southwest we're going to send temperatures up into the mid seventies what do you think of that\nOne that is amazing I Know who are\nComplaining that you're not alone I I understand what you're saying wow it's cold this morning and by tomorrow afternoon some people might be saying wow and now I think it's a little too warm now going the other way but uh that's [laughter] but that's the way it goes now the minor flying the meant that it's really a low impact because they always say\nUh when when it is a low impact there could be a brief light showers sprinkles sometime tomorrow night that will be about it\nOther than that it's dry and was setting the stage for cooler weather for Monday holiday\nNorth east wind return we're gonna see temperatures back into the uh low in the sixties so in terms of temperature today and Monday are about the same tomorrow is the warm day in the mid seventies now as we go into next week Tuesday and Wednesday after the holiday weekend ends\nEveryone goes back or at least most people go back to work in school\nOr on Tuesday we warm up more again so the Tuesday it's going to be a little like tomorrow back into the seventies and the afternoon and then we get to eighty how about this eighty degrees on Wednesday\nOf next week this upcoming week and then we'll get wet by either Wednesday night or Thursday a front\nAnd we will likely be a you'll be hearing this news lane and Mike over the coming days hurricane Michael likely to bring trouble to the Gulf Coast and I've been saying this all this past week whenever there's a hurricane or in the in the ... or the threat of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico with all those oil rigs out there\nAh they have a tendency to be very cautious and the price of oil\nUh they have a tendency to be very cautious and the price of oil goes up there for the price of gas goes up so I highly recommend a if you're someone who is really a petty about the prices of gas and trying to save a few cents\nOr dollars whatever it is you might want to get some gas next couple of days 'cause I I highly thinks the prices of gas\nCould spike up uh five ten cents a gallon next week because this hurricane when they get into the Gulf they need any excuse to raise the price of oil which then beans gas and so get some gas over the next couple of days fill up your tank if you're someone who worries about that so you don't have to pay a lot more next week\nWe'll you know what I'm there was a report last evening about gas prices generally in the fall they go down down down but because of Iran\nAnd the United states and a precedent ah [noise] ... non negotiable eating and the tension between our countries um oil production has gone down so we have to look for other resources and price of oil is actually increase per barrel\nSo now you're right I'm prices are going to start to go up up up your right but if your values shop at stopping shopping you have gas point I think now's the time to do that to use those because let me tell ya there you go I go for a forty cents off a gallon of gas or thirty cents off again and I think right now I have forty cents\nOff a ... a gallon of gas it adds up especially when does this with them on July ...\nYeah you have to do obviously a regular amount of driving everyday work was yeah wherever you have to\nGo so it does add up yes well those those factors you're correct\nA U.S in Iran the fight the one negative that isn't a good way for all of us as you said this was a time of year in the fall when when the they switch over to the cheaper price of gas for the winter so the one good thing that might not make it as worse as it could be is the fact that this was the time you're usually with nothing else going\nSaying that might not make it as worse as it could be as the fact that this was a time of year it usually with nothing else going on usually the price of gas falls and then it's levels off around Christmas 'cause they know people are going to do a lot of driving around the holidays what levels off\nBut uh but so we'll have to wait and see but the wildcard weather wise\nOr nothing to do with the rise to the U.S are fighting back and forth is the fact that uh the price of gas usually goes up when there's a hurricane that threatens the Gulf of Mexico now again I say that for us because you're in the ... area of\nSome of the rain from that could get here could be a very wet Thursday that's still down the road but\nUh the next we'll buy with a grain of any consequences would be ... it looks like around either late Wednesday night of Thursday mhm well that's the way to look at that but until then are really not bad for this holiday weekend nice again it's cool is boring but again at least we have some sort of colors and the sky to offset it a little bit\nAnd we're going to get to ... you know by say two o'clock this afternoon will be up around sixty five degrees that's not too bad\nOh now it's a balmy sixty times yes I remember going to win eighty five or Ninety five so many so many weeks ago [laughter]\nYeah I Know yeah and just so now we're getting to reap the benefits of these shorter days cause the sun again going down by the way sunset today and I think ... was it maybe it was last night I don't know if you've mentioned it and you're out in the boats or is there a sort of us a short a small water fire going on in Providence\nI haven't seen it through our um I haven't seen the mortar fire tonight one\nWhere they only do it in the base and I think I remember Don mentioned and get this past week I only bring that up because the only usually have the water fires that start right at sunset\nProvidence a six they're alive or six forty five yeah yeah\nWell today sunset or is six sixteen now\nTo a quarter half way\nYeah so uh yeah so again that's again the shorter days now of course I we're now four weeks away\nAnd uh that's then again the shorter days now of course I we're now four weeks away as we talked about last week a November four that's the day we set the clocks back so the sun will be setting closer to by that time around you know before five o'clock\nAnd then by the at least it will get a little bit later in the morning again so we're now we've got four weeks from today or tonight and tomorrow is when we are now it's going to be setting the clocks back between now and then again this this is happens every year now since we change this a timing of\nOf the sunrise and sunset ... a few years ago it's going to be quite dark on cloudy morning for the kids at the bus stops so that's something to consider over the coming days I mean today we had mostly clear skies are wasn't an issue and it was a weekend right we get some we get some of these cloudy dreary\nMornings before we set the clocks back and we're going to have darkness sometimes\nA until about eight o'clock in the morning so oh wow that is the only that's the only negative people will say oh I don't want to set the clocks back it's going to be so dark in the late afternoon while it also was going to be quite dark in the morning until you said it doesn't tell you is that the clocks back so with it you can't really win with either of these by the way the let's end with a nice note\nUh coming up in a few days now a couple of weeks the full hunter moon ... and that leads to beat that leads to be into of course that's caused with a hunters for years past but\nAlso still there's some of that going on but everything is early this year you in some of the full moons\nA and just like you mentioned Columbus Day being a early this year\nBecause it's always the second Monday in um in October and this year the first Monday was October first last Monday so that's why it's so early but also ah the foliage again is delayed so anyone that's oh it's the ... Columbus Day weekend I'm going to go look at the fold here to even go into Maine New Hampshire and Vermont well you're going to go up there as a joke yeah last week\nOr you're gonna go up there and like the party hasn't started yet really you'll see some color it's real\nAre you going to go up there and like the party hasn't started yet really you'll see some color and it's really you go up if you go up this weekend a\nFor two reasons one of the weather has been too warm and to Columbus Day we get his early this year you'll go up there and you say where the heck is the color right it's not if you want to wait really for another two or three weeks if you want to really enjoy the fall foliage not just here but especially after the north\nOh okay that's interesting yeah I Know that I think like the colors and just kind of just turning a little bit I see some of the maple trees turning just a little that you some of the other like how they\nMake the makers of the one that teach you every year they're the ones the red ones in sometimes deep oranges and then already some of the leaves you see of already fallen off like what's going on with these then you look at the majority all the other trees that are still kind of green those are like the folks\nUm I've been out voted on that really yeah [laughter] I don't know\nDon't know I'd put it out to vote and they said well what's I'm thinking this is a fundraiser you know what else can we just we can do you know fifty fifty for pennies us you know yeah let's keep asking for the money we may off an auction off a bobble head of a um Pedro Martinez bobble heads\nFor the money we may off an auction off a bobble head of a um Pedro Martinez bobble head it off yeah it was a lot of work with that stuff together I think some people didn't want to do the work that I get it just want to relax and enjoy the workers last year in the Tracy project\nOh my gosh yeah yeah well I I Hope that they have a I Hope that you have a some sort of like a bucket or jar is something that you can have like just a penny pleased to put your pennies in or something so people that are there can make ... make a donation there and write a check or\nEvery table a little pumpkin on it season yeah you can put up you can put the put your coins or perfect bad checks whatever you want to get [laughter]\n[laughter] that's a great home can yes make sure that that is known throughout the evening to make a donation and that that'd be great because um I think you get some money from that as well yeah I'm always thinking ahead for fundraising events and stuff yeah yeah he was\nGoing to do to be a bit and then when they're done I'm going to come up and just do a three or four minutes won't be of comedy just of 'cause a lot of people coming to I don't know the story you know just a penny is all about\nRight so I guess I should add so good op you won't be a dollar but it won't be as far as you know all the rest of those guys\nRight right no I think it's important when you have a fundraising event like this to give the history of the organization and and the phenomenal journey that you have shared with everyone and along the way I mean you've touched so many lives in so many hearts along the way that you never know you'll never know\nYeah that's a that's the part that's really thinking it was at that time to sit down before the last two weeks\n[laughter] you lord I don't think so I think that year I'd go get her from the get go yeah but you to be commended for all the work that you've done and I'm Glad that you're reaching out to Julie hall and others because um she's a phenomenal um\nSee now to Julie hall and others because um she's a phenomenal a force here in the ... area and she's a good connection person here down here in

fact I ... I Would almost take this type of the morning there in the morning we got back in July when it was Seventy five and eighty degrees at like seven o'clock in the morning you know so\nAgain it's nice and delightful out there and we're going to really be a dry for the most part even any any light shower tomorrow night will be low impact no strong winds know lightening or anything like that so a good news for the weekend now next Saturday at this time next Saturday\nWe will just have the passage of the front and maybe the remnants of what could potentially be hurricane Michael a that would be Thursday perhaps into a portion of friday and then dry cool\nHurricane Michael er that would be Thursday perhaps into a portion of friday and then dry cool wins\nA will begin to next weekend so early early indications are next weekend or we may be looking at temperatures in the fifties and thirties at night and with winds blowing so out a real feel of a real fall coming in perhaps by next weekend so\nUh you know get to enjoy what's going on now now have still way not in your car but have you not still put on the heat at home\nUh\nMaybe one day one day okay forget they are to get to chill out and then I yeah I Know I understand\nYeah that's the way and of course this year you got a lot of people if they like to wait it out probably can get through because I again until next weekend you might not have to deal with any heat as well because we're going to start over all to uh you know to stay fairly warm above average\nRight keep in mind our our average high temperature is just like we're going to be today sixty five ... tomorrow it's going to be Seventy five like I said so we're going to go above that now in the tropics yet we still have Leslie Leslie the storm it's been around I Would have been calling it lovely lovely because it's it's a lovely story does not bother\nFor about two and a half weeks spinning around out in the middle of the Atlantic and they're only worried about it or when the big cruise ships go or the big oil tankers whatever they are go from Europe back to a\nNew York and New York and New England back to what your\nOther than that ... has been a storm that has not cause any trouble now again the next them on the list the storm goes alphabetical L. M. and is Michael and that's the one that might be a big deal next week so ah and again it could drive oil prices up there for the price of gas\nAnd of course there's a delay factor so that does hit somewhere or the the gas the issues could go into the following week so we'll have to monitor that and then the next main storm in the list and there's a potential for bats forming late next week I Would be nay dean\nI'm On the list and there's a potential for bats forming late next week I Would be nay dean so uh that's the next one to ...\nI don't I don't either [laughter]\nAnyway now here's the thing that here's the thing I Want to mention there was a tornado in New England Tuesday where it was Mm\nNo it wasn't Mansfield yes\nBut not but not here in Mansfield where I Am in Mansfield, Connecticut I say that not to try and sound like a like a a be a a a wise you know what\nSaying oh you are not a guy and [laughter]\nIt used to it right [laughter] so but I bring us up seriously ill

area a real nice part of Connecticut actually it's about Fifteen twenty miles over the border from Rhode Island but anyway there was a tornado there it was an F. zero tornado which is like a like the lowest grade but you have against they'll call it a tornado\nBut I bring that up because in Nineteen Seventy nine we had a very similar fall which is setting up the jet stream patterns\nWe had tornados in Connecticut you might remember there was one that killed a few people in Windsor locks\nYeah which is just yeah it's that you remember that and and you can flip the the\nThe airline museum there the there was a museum there they flipped complains I've two uh two or three people killed now again that's terrible to bring up but\nIt it it was a season just like this everything has delayed normally we would see that more like ... in back in September August not October\nAnd sold at St jetstream patterns are lining up this year we had hurricane David in Frederick that year that came up from the Gulf and went up to the eastern United States very similar to what Michael could do next week and I bring this up once again with all this to be talking about a tornado or David in Frederick that\nIt's up once again with all this be talking about a tornado or David in Frederick that that season Nineteen Seventy nine followed Seventy nine that following winter was the warmest one of the mild us and more importantly least snowy as winter in a hundred years\nSo we're starting to see a with El Nino kicking in we may not might not being we're not going to get a lot of rain but this may very well go down there was a a more confident than ever now that we're not going to have a lot of snow this winter so if you if you're someone who does not like snow or you might like this upcoming winter now doesn't mean that might be one\nSix inch snow fall and then the rest of the winter might have nothing it might be one of those uh so uh that's the good news for those listening that don't like snowy winters don't like to shovel snow this could be your winter coming up it's looking like Nineteen Seventy nine and ... which\n\nIn the\nMorning I sorry do I need to Laurie Laurie Sawyer is here\nBut I have sorry to hear Laurie Sawyer is here and she has a new show on Fridays at five o'clock and [laughter] and and I didn't realize that we had come back from\nMichael's jeeze what is your job could producing the music would be a hand foot but I was thinking I was talking to them because it was just a really interesting but um I Do want to start off but before I talked to her um you know that um [noise] so I grew up\nWith the civil rights movement but in a took over a hundred years and um but folks are still being discriminated against even to this day I'm\nGrowing up in my experience in my neighborhoods in my family and friends um we're going to be talking about the L G Beatty community today\nAnd uh and all of that and most of us really don't know that much about it and I really didn't know that much about it until I started doing some research and that and then I've worked with people\nWho are gay and I didn't realize that there was such a discrimination I thought everybody was equal in the workplace I thought that everybody was\nHad had been treated equally but then I was realizing that I'm being gay is just really it's really difficult part of it in America life because you are still being discriminated against\nYou like I was reading like if your partner is in the hospital there are some hospitals that say you can't even go in and visit them because you are not quote unquote a family member but you're married to this person who is the love of your life and\nI mean all these things are still happening I Am so I Am so blown away by all of this so I'm Glad Laurie Laurie ... come on today to talk to us about equality\nAnd then there's ballot questions that we're going to get into as well but I'm I'm just so I it's two thousand Eighteen for God's sakes and I just saw\nI'm just so I it's two thousand each for God's sakes and I just so amazed that there isn't more acceptance and there's so much ignorance out there still to this day and it just it just blows my mind it really does so\nWell in my show thank you [noise] ah you know I mean we actually live in\nI'm a great place New England has is very accepting um and well to Massachusetts is a great state because in two dozen for where the first state to pass marriage equality\nMeaning that you know it seems that people can get married legally in the state\nAnd then it kind of went around the country and then I think it was um it was around who lives in Thirteen when the entire country was called the um um equal where everybody could\nGet married um throughout the entire country now that doesn't mean that they don't have these laws like you said where some people can't go and visit their loved ones in the in in hospitals um around here again we're a pretty good with that\nUh we're kind of everybody every state is kind of behind in transgender equality and that's why\nWe're talking about the ballot question coming up in November uh-huh which is big because\nThere are two dozen sixteen the governor had\nPut this part on to the public accommodations law public accommodations is basically where you can go anywhere in the state you can go to hotels you can go to restaurants you can go to public restrooms you every place that you anybody can go is a public accommodation\nNow the governor put this into the law so that transgender people would be um in that line of nondiscrimination you know they've got like you said race and sex and gender and whatever but\nYou know they've got like you said race and sex and gender and whatever but in this law now it says also transgender uh your gender identity and expression cannot be discriminated against and so he put this in the law into as and sixteen\nAnd uh now there are opposition people who are against that that wants to repeal that want to take that out of the law so that people businesses can discriminate against transgender people from going out in public a combination anywhere\nSo businesses could say we don't treat we don't serve your kind here you can't come here\nThe big part of what the opposition is saying is that is they're calling it a bathroom bill which it really is not a bathroom bill yes it does include a public bathrooms but it's not a bathroom bill\nThey are saying that men can now dress up as women going women's bathrooms to assault people\nNow that's not what's happening transgender people are there real gender because that's how they're now I'm identifying uh-huh and they're dressed like women or or men for that matter and\nThey're going in the bathroom of their gender right so they're in it we were talking about last night actually we've been going through a talking about this question\nAnd I had a a young man young transgender man who was a senior in high school here and it was talking about you know what is what's gonna happen if that's the case then he would have to be going into a woman's bathroom\nBecause that's the gender that he was born with now he doesn't look like a woman so that's also the problem he looks like a man right he's you know a dress like his hair is like a man who um you know he's been has had hormones you had top surgery you know it's like I don't need it\nUm you know he's been has had hormones you had top surgery you know it's like I don't need it tell of this information but you know how is that person going to be going into a woman's bathroom it's going to be definitely the same type of thing that they don't want right so how are they going to be policing that and how are they going to\nYou know if it comes off the ballot mean off that law how are they going to do that that's just like\nSo much discrimination against people for who they are you know whether they love somebody at the same sex or if they're the other gender it's just it's all\nQuite crazy and in this state for it to be happening you know Massachusetts being I'm the first one who had marriage equality I always like to think that you know we've got it great here in the state to actually why I moved back to Massachusetts because\nYou know had the quality of marriage equality so right and and it's also we were talking about an hour just keep talking but\nI'm the hospital visitation and if you are a street person and you want to go visit your I'm not married partner your girlfriend her husband you can you can you know be put on to you know still again here in Massachusetts\nAh it it's better you know you can visit your loved one even if you're not married but the married part is the problem in most states is if you're not married\nYou can't go and visit your loved one but also some state I'm Still try to push back on that a nationwide marriage equality law so\nThere's a lot that's happening in the country but you know we're kind of right now on my show anyway it's focusing on the ballot question that we've been working on 'em that's coming up in November right right I had been to a conference recently and I'm In the women's bathroom like\nI had been to a conference recently and I'm\nIn the women's bathroom like right outside of said you know like men's bathroom women's bathroom underneath that there was a sign that said transgendered welcome and I thought on that I Know why all this is awesome and it's like you know you go into the bathroom it doesn't matter you know I mean I didn't\nYeah I've seen a lot um but I ended up putting up um both genders on bathrooms you know are unisex or you know so that it doesn't matter which bathroom you go in\nRight and I think that that's the when when all around just make them all unisex yes you know I mean right but that fear\nLike you were saying about men dressing up as women are going in and trying to\nMolest kids are ... women that that's such like Nineteen forties fifties thinking I mean it's like are you kidding people actually think that way I mean when I was digging into this research it was like people are so narrow minded they're still prejudice there's still all of this discrimination and it's\nIt's not against the afro Americans any more it's like it's focusing in on on the ...\nI don't know I Want to say to him since two thousand sixteen when the governor put that line in uh the law there has not been any reports of any kind of people using the bathroom as I'm for mount intent so\nIn two years nothing has happened so why are they pushing for it to be taken off of the law it if there was like all of these cases of people who have been going into bathrooms and doing these things you know then maybe you can see them wanting to take it off but there's absolutely no reason\nFor that and you know I don't know what they've been seeing or thinking or whatever and maybe they've been seeing a person who you know I don't know\nThey just get all upset if I if a male is going and sitting in the in the stall instead of standing\nUpset if I have a male is going and sitting in the in the stall instead of standing out on the Yarnell I don't know making it up but [laughter]\nNo I hear you but I think that that stereotypical\nAh is still there the stereotype of typical person of being gay or um\nI mean I was reading some ... this is two thousand Eighteen and people are still so narrow minded it's like they\nIt's just like it calling it non like it's not normal it's not\nIt's like you've got to be kidding me an oldest discrimination and if they were an employee they can fire you because you're openly gay I mean this is like\nWhere um well we're Jay last night was talking about if he were to be a having to go into a female bathroom because of his um you know birth gender then that could be something 'cause he kind of you know looks more like a male he passes as a male ... houses\n'cause he kind of you know looks more like a male he passes as a male ... of houses mhm wow\nSo it seems like we're taking a step back in so many states and then we're not really so many ways yeah yeah and so many ways how can we make this better how can we how can I guess I'm I'm at a loss for words as far as like how can we have this acceptance\nI mean it's really knowing people in education because it's something that we all deal with in coming out to and what did you kind of know\nA algae beauty person then you know that they're just a person you know and it doesn't matter who they love or what their gender identity is and but people don't even want to go there you know they don't even want to get to know somebody they don't even want to\nSee uh people who are different than them they don't want them in their in their lives in there a circle [laughter] you know so\nI don't I don't know how to make it better right we've got a friend this question there is a state organization called freedom freedom math and\nThey're trying to push you know the the question for people to vote yes to keep it on a on a on the bill so vote yes on question three and\nSo they've got many different uh things that are going on you might see some signs out there that says you know vote yes on three a and there's not a lot of them because they are small group but we're trying to push that too when I um I have some science\n[laughter] anybody wants to sign me up on three uh and and that's how we're we're trying to promote it is to kind\nOf just and show people um\nWe're trying to promote it and write a kind of just and show people um people are just people and they're just trying to live their lives and just trying to go to public accommodations right and not be discriminated for it right\nI think a lot of people that are ignorant to the fact\nI think it's based on fear um you know I I don't know like I said I'm this is a this is something that I've I've delved into for just a few days and looking at all the research and all and I just it's just blaring ignorance you know people that are educated or like fearful or\nAnyone who was the fear you know when when they can come at you I mean what's the fear seriously it's a it's like what are you afraid of a different\nDifferent [laughter] you know because it's different you're different and it's a different lifestyle and I don't know you know it's just I don't have that I just think that you're right I think that public education out there and acceptance\nI mean if one of my children said to me that I'm gay you know like I'm suddenly um you know there that they are gay I Would be accepting of that matter of fact\nI have to tell you is a true story I have twin sons and a daughter and I thought one of my sons was actually by the time it was three I thought oh looks like he's gay because he would play with my my daughter's Barbie dolls he would be playing whatever and\nYou had the mannerisms and things like that and it was like I always thought and I I when he was growing up and everything and they were dating and everything I just I always thought that some day he would come and tell him you know mom I'm gay\nAnd I had no problem with that because I just thought that I Love you no matter what and I really thought about that and I was just so surprised when you ... you know when he started dating this girl got married and and they have kids and it's like oh okay you know so I mean it was like\nBut seriously I mean it's like I\nOkay you know so I mean it was like but seriously I mean it's like I think that that a mother's lover is accepting of of your child no matter what I'm ...\nYears here is that is great you know you and you're right you would think that way but there are some\nKids who are gay or if they are transgender and they've told their parents\nAre kicked out of house there's um I'm a big population of homeless or adolescents who are gay or transgender uh-huh because their parents won't have it they're like no you can't be in my house if you're gonna be that way and that's that's just totally wrong you can't even imagine how a\nPerson who has come out of your body you know what they're telling you\nI'm Out who they are right that you would reject them but there are people like that wow and its locally too it's not just down in the south or Jay and I'm In mid west you know it's it is

you get to say you know I'd love\nTo help you know I didn't give you a ... yeah [laughter] oh they all take it all ... was for sure\n[laughter] I Wish you would think so anyway yeah so that's my\nStory um let me see if we can get um we have we do have a um a guest who's a coming in so will allow that to that person to be here five a way to to to Thirteen twenty five a way to to to Thirteen joined this this headset\nIs driving me nuts now it's getting worse over here I have a ... a a gym I write your left as you look on the radio ladies and gentlemen we have um I'm a young man from the city council here in the city of album or one Mr\nA ... good morning morning how are you sir I only do only two or three only to a higher outstanding yeah yeah good how is that might lead into them I I'm Sorry about that because as I better you know a guy who's running\nNow now what's happening to what do we owe\nAs a better you know a guy who's running now now what's happening\nTo what do we owe the pleasure and surprise of your visit to ... yeah well you must have something wonderful you want yeah you're selling some you something you\nDon't have anything good except a little bit of free time this morning so I figured I Would come in and say Hi there you go to jail or anything on your life you know there's always [laughter] you know [noise]\nUm well well well tell me what's happening in in the council that\nWe should know about anything about to go to be that we can't know about yeah yeah yeah you know ...\nThere's there's so much going on so there's there's always all the the marijuana stuff that's in\n... are all yeah let you talk about that yeah that was because there was a story about north Adam are not wanting the um the the marijuana sales downtown downtown right and they got to have a vote on it I guess right\nAnd they really should they need storage downtown well she's like well let's go out and sort of way um yeah\nIn in so we unnatural restricted it to industrial zones and and I disagreed with that but ultimately I'm I'm happy that that it passed in\nIn that we're we're moving forward and we're actually one of the first semester that didn't stand in it and it's going to be in the industrial zone oh it did until in till we change it no no no no well until you change yeah until someone decides you know what I don't think so uh ensues\nYou think absolutely okay I've said there's\nThere's plenty of cities across Massachusetts that that have also restricted to\n... marijuana people probably didn't want to have the expense of doing it but it's unconstitutional okay in my very stupid and humble opinion it it's it's completely uncomfortable to do if I have a mattress store and I want to be\nBe next to him you know a liquor store I can do that I I obviously disagreed with it myself personally I thought yeah the will to counsel ... it it passed six to six for 'em to to keep it restricted to industrial and and that's that was the will of the council mhm\nYeah okay well so now ... now north Anna but it was going to try and do the same thing where they got to put it and then I got to they don't have an industrial park that they can\nPretend a rise in it's just absolutely have that doesn't make sense has a couple of in Dallas oh do they okay All right so that's what they'll do maybe I don't know\nBut we just passed or second a medical marijuana special permit so that that just passed and that's for O'Neill boulevard for a company over there okay um\nSo that was good in ... it was the first one that I'd done but I just followed with Julie Holland done in the precedent she is at the past and it was it was pretty straightforward\nYeah I think I think you know like you said I'm Glad that they're at least getting that far you know the uh reefer madness stuff going on and was really\nCertainly lane now he'll be glad to know that the marijuana still either they have a place for Jeff beside the landfill\nOh really I don't know well after all we want to those people write me well they'll never noticed the smell no [laughter] that'd be heads the marijuana and you know ... you don't you don't sound [laughter]\nIsn't there aren't many cities or towns in Massachusetts that have actually passed ordinance is allowing a adult use marijuana yet we're one of the first twenty four when the first two dozen to do it so it as much as it was a\nPerfect movie as an adult use marijuana I that's the politically correct Germany as opposed to recreational oh is that oh the kids can do it it's the adults that we can't regulate [laughter]\nYou can do it it's the adults that we can't regulate [laughter] [laughter] I don't use\nMarijuana that's I didn't realize that says professor at Ohio yeah but you know we were one of the ... the first communities to to pass this\nSo I I I think we're doing good as far as being business friendly as as much as we get a\nAnd one of the things so I just sent a letter to the candidates control commission yeah who on the Eighteenth are meeting to discuss whether or not to move forward with 'em but do use delivery services within the state in in working on regulating that in developing laws\nDelivery services said and call up and have it like a pizza correct I Would do it [laughter] but there's\nNow I'm like oh well you don't want somebody driving delivery right along that class and no American\nCupcakes 'cause they put it and everything you know so you can have it sure is now in\nMy view there's there's three reasons why why this incredibly important specifically for Adam ... in the so one of the the reason for like you just said as a safety issue you prefer not to have people driving but the other thing in ... where we restricted everything to industrial zones I'm\nOne of the the main reasons for passing a legal adult use marijuana is to replace the illicit market in in order for that to effectively happen you need to have accessibility to this so by allowing delivery\nWe also increase the accessibility in ... move a little bit forward and and replacing the black market or the illicit market\nIn that's good for my safety perspective is well not just for driving but because all of these products are are tested and regulated by the state so you want\nBecause all of these products are are tested and regulated by the state so\nYou ... if people know will know exactly what they're they're getting it in theory um but then there's there's other benefits of\nOn October thirtieth like going into the the other benefit is from a revenue standpoint all of these communities around Edinburgh that they have it passed their their ordinances or or maybe just a\n... a\nMarijuana establishments in Arab broke and then sell to these um other communities in that tax revenue comes back to Atlanta so there's a there's a financial benefit as well so I'm Will be killed ... other communities or other communities\nSo for instance north ... hasn't passed their right ordinances yet\nIn theory when when this passes and we have established was set up here in animals they can then sell to the surrounding communities oh in the tax revenue from those sales goes back to the community of origin ... so that would be coming back to ... so\nWe definitely have a a benefit of being one of the initial um communities out there in in that respect\nSo I I still don't understand why why can't the inner city has to be in and got in gas you know so much for me and said that\nI don't understand the rationale either um and and I say honestly and this is the old\n... still going on but you can't have that you always say porn shops you know for years you know you're going to have you did they didn't want one shops or or or topless bars and it's the same foolishness you know\nAnd that's that that's a credible but I don't know that that we need to do much with it now aside from potentially make uh putting some some running trails in there and whatnot something relatively inexpensive because\nWe just with the city doesn't have the money in my opinion to be spending a significant amount of money on that while we're at the same time telling people their taxes are going to go up significantly in for the new high school um\nSo my my focus now I I haven't invested a ton of energy into thinking about island country club\nOr be your glove root for that that respect my my focus now is on looking at some a property tax relief for for seniors because they they came out and in largely voted in favor of purchasing those do high school but they're the ones that will largely be impacted the most\nNow one of the things that I had heard about it and spend it with our we wanted to go to the country club [noise] was that uh that the mayor had made a deal to have the the holding area right now on the on the land on when they're doing construction they need a place to put vehicles in in ...\nAnd when when they're doing construction they need a place to put vehicles and and stuff and ... had sold or at least I'm a huge piece that matches what they paid\nFor the property correct right let's say the savings will be roughly equivalent yeah so so that technically is is that you know the city has saved all gotten back the money that they purchase I aligned with well by doing that I deal then I I mean on paper that's not entirely okay yes or no\nYou can say I'm wrong Todd it's okay you know around ... I'll say I'm not entirely correct um so\nYes we'll save roughly the equivalent amount of money in the high school construction projects so we'll save roughly three million dollars by having that staging area available to us the issue is where this this the in the um ... is is paying for half of the high school project\nAny money we save goes back to the state so by saving that three million dollars that doesn't mean all of a sudden we have three million more dollars in our pockets okay um what it does mean is by saving that three million dollars we can\nFind other things within the school building project that to to maybe upgrade or improve and\nYeah but then again and again that still we've got three million dollars back\nCorrect to use to use to his all I mean I'm listening to me defending them there but I mean a button but but you know I mean that that was a cool move I think it will have coal move and I was impressed with it you know the problem is that\nEvery once in a while this guy well you know broke clock is already twice a day but that aside from that this guy comes up with stuff and hit stuff on the money and then all of a sudden he walks in dark crap and I and I can't figure it I think so\nAnd then all of a sudden he walks in dark crap and I and I can't figure it out or off in a career out of it a more often than not I agree\nWith the mayor he and I have our differences from time to time you know this this was a a great move in and purchasing highly country club was a great move the ... yeah it's great yeah I'm In as much as I'm not emotionally invested in ... I think is illusion for the\nFor the end on that one news really weird you know we're talking about ... [laughter] adapt to explain that to to ... countries\nBeagle club road is a is a is a road that has access to Manchester reservoir and the it's gone back and forth for years and years and there's parking restrictions or whatnot the mayor's put forward a proposal to\nPut a parking lot at the end of ... road and come up with the system where the ... you can\nPurchase parking passes for that parking lot and the residents will get passes to park along the the road and purchase additional passes and that there's this whole system of\nBuying a purchasing parking on ... road it's kind of messy but\n[laughter] no no it is if it is about ... and what's happened is these these these residents over there are all upset 'cause people parking on this street because they're going\nFishing or they're gonna they're doing yeah okay yes I Know you do because you feel when what happened was still and still are one lady I Can't get in on okay so okay financial and yell at me a PIN okay okay so there is an example\nWell try and live across the evil athletic Christmas good like oh no I Try to get out of the driveway and have a ... now we've got to be I mean\nBut this this whole uh deal of of of vouchers and parking in how's your sister and you can't\nOf of of of vouchers and parking in how's your sister and you can't win a shot at\nAll but still the residents are comfortable with it and the the fishermen are also comfortable with it so it's a it's an acceptable compromise to an issue that's going on and on for well over ten years although you know if both sides are okay with it\nThen move forward next but LA why don't you go again next [laughter] I mean I didn't bring up big ... for ... years rodeo did it smelled so\nFar is that another Beagle club where people go hunting with their vehicles\nIs that a lot of the name of the really young you know maybe they used to have a bigger context I don't know I don't know I don't like the Oakland as your Beagle ever been a member of a club done no no don't go there and guns and and yeah ... yeah yeah no this is not well\nSo you you bring up guns and hunting and whatnot so one of the other things that that I've been working on and\nFans psychic and you bring voted I can see I Know it's ... it's a it's a great great segue is psychotic [laughter]\nUm [laughter] I've been\nTrying to move forward a hunting ordinance change simply to require hundreds if they go on private property to request in have in writing\nPermission for Johnny ... yeah I only lived and it it it only makes sense and my dad wasn't ... that still hasn't been settled I've been talking about that for a couple of years\nRight I mean that was a hot item a couple of years ago right yeah yeah it's\nCurrently stuck in in the public safety committee a so hopefully we'll get some movement with that relatively soon\nOn the hunt is on the safety committee\nI'm On the safety committee a but it's tough to\nI'm On the safety committee um but it's tough to get it out of the committee ... can't they depending\n... still and still tough to get out of that committee ... yeah as Peter right what's his problem\nI I think he had I I don't know but my assumption is that that there's a concerned about being able to enforce it or any changes so I I don't know you\n... if not at his job isn't to enforce in his job is to pass it and let the chief worry about it ... or at least have the conversation um yeah but yeah but\nThen again I'm a freshman counselor I'm new to to the council\nSo well trust pass the first of all trust passing laws are still in effect correct right have you come on my property to get your tennis ball but you hit over without my permission you trespassing\nBut for that you need to mark your property appropriately in every X number of feet you have to have a no trespassing hunting side and and all of that\nNo no ... or ... or changed your shorts [laughter] uh invisible fence row elephant than invisible fence all you need [laughter] [laughter] I mean it's just a you know [laughter]\nWe'll we'll see how that that proceeds one of the things that was interesting to me as I was researching it in looking into it is\nThere's a if you look at a map of the what's called the urban sprawl as communities grow and grow and have less and less open space within the communities\nUm they they call that the urban sprawl and if you look at sort of a map of Boston you can see sort of a wave emanating out from Boston as these communities become denser and denser is regarding population or whatnot\nAs as this urban sprawl expanse each of these communities tends to\nAs as this urban sprawl expanse each of these communities tends to pass a similar um know hunting law or a law requiring written permission for hunting and and if you look at the map it sort of\nExpand west of Boston and then just stops at outer borough so I think it's it's about time for for us to pass it as well\nMhm yeah\nOK I'm ready and then people living in a woman in Latin\n... shot to death by Sunday on her I had land thinking she didn't have gear or something to happen\nNow I've long ago it may have I'm not I'm not familiar with that yeah yeah\nI'm trying to find something that can fight with them about done I mean you don't don't don't encourage ...\nWhat about the air and giving them back there four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to clean up the\nUh yeah I Know I saw an article by didn't get a chance to read that article now now the area has this money right or that they were going to give it give to back to the city right correct so what happened\nSo they came to there's a property down at the New England sports village by the way we're talking with Todd Kobe scares you joined us we're talking with Todd Culver City council it from the city of bad or good so\nRegarding the air a I'm the oldest city roughly a hundred thousand dollars a little a little bit over a\nI say if you're number to my phone so did you ...\nWell that

twenty telephone number to call Don his ear you and me on the radio if you want to shout love to hear from 'em most of you and uh have you call up and give us anything at all you've got on your mind today\nYeah I'd like to know if anybody has been watching a million little things have you seen them know they know it was on Monday and Tuesday nights\nSeen and do they know it was on Monday and Tuesday last week but this week I think this week just as\nSaturday right yet which is this Saturday\nAnd it's about suicide oh and it's when I when I first saw it I said oh man they could go all kinds of places with this very good storylines very good actors very believable situation and their scenarios\nUm so it's about a million little things that people start to notice when a close friend of theirs is no longer in physical form\nOr as I Would say yeah yeah so this guy jumped off the roof of the building mhm and killed himself\nWhich you know you got to be careful if you do that because you might not kill yourself but you would wish that you had yeah once he landed he didn't die anyway so\nUm I was wondering if you I Wish that they would they would introduce some one of the characters I'm believing that she or he was getting messages from their departed\nFriend yup but probably would never there were like well there's been lots of shows like that [noise]\nI don't know I think some people think that might be the death knell of of shows 'cause it's a little too far oats\nNope no especially now people are really people are getting more and more on board now with this and in an exception going and talking about accepting more\nWell I Wish they would lose that was to show it was a perfect perfect launch pad for something\nLike that or they may and I don't know yeah yeah they do some writing or oh come up with an idea and that'll be it\nYeah yeah yeah some writer who gets a message from someone to come out of that argument right yeah yeah exactly right yeah yeah it's really interesting\nTo to see people's dealings with\nA ... death what we call death\nIt was dealings with a with death\nWhat we call death when they get into the body what we called death yeah well what they call I guess we should say what they yeah um\nAnd you know I've always believed in the hereafter et cetera I've always believed that our loved ones are around us I've always I've believed in the ability to do psychic ... medium type of things but I never had the evidence that\nI have now makes a big difference in it [laughter] it really believing young age ... greatly comforting yeah\nAnd it gives you the the feeling that the boy there's really something going on here that school\nAnd you don't have any mafia of your own body guy yeah right no not ... not at all yeah ... yeah yeah [laughter] yeah I yeah NATO or\nNot at all yeah yeah and it's kind of a well\nIt should be um it should be encouraging to be ... but it isn't ... because people\nUm I have a relative who is a a black belt Catholic and I'm God Bless her but\nShe's I mean she's still dealing with the belief in purgatory and get\nThat's good that's I agree with that yeah you have all the information but at this point of view whether I agree with Kavanaugh or I agree with the lady a doctor it besides the point is justice system should not be even even I gave an example I said well how could you assume something without knowing all the facts\nI says oh she is a she looks very credible okay\nI Am Andrew sometimes is that it wasn't my name I get angry because people put me in that so I told the story to this gentleman at work and it's just really I said yeah really put my name in that position yet you a strong now that she is credible which one is it\nSo you can just live it ... that you know you don't need them to say\nWell I think having a problem for me having a problem for me didn't come from her camera from for me came from his testimony in the in the hearing where he decided it was a the Kennedys were on to get them\nI mean a ... that's the kind of foolishness I realized when it came to his impartiality to political\nThat's that's why I or go to paper work about him was was uh not shown to anybody because he's been he's had problems before he's not ... who's innocent you know I don't think Kevin ...\nWell yeah but I mean there wasn't even about innocent or guilty for me on that because he disqualified himself because of his response was in uh the hearings that the enemy say uh I don't want them mhm or not having to do\nIt again if he did something different in the hearing it still does not correlate\nDifferent in that hearing the still does not correlate that the lady is right and he's wrong quota vice versa on the subject of an accusation whatever you do after that is it's separate\nFrom I I agree I agree but I'm not talking about that I'm Talking about uh this is a political observation I wanted to do with his bringing the Kennedys and ... that's what I'm Talking about\nI disagree with him too but in general sense or to find him not guilty I agree with his demeanor a he's a\nLife work in a judicial system ... he's the weight I seen them before the healing mhm yeah I think he is not guilty on that sense um other than that he puts everything to political I disagree with him too because that's what they do pull them in with political\nIssues in them and they lose the sense of what is actually in in stake here I mean I feel sorry for his wife and a phrase daughter too I mean why they're going to put up with this\nIs why I don't like the whole thing has quit yeah his his wife was very sad and I think she's seen this before in him\nGood couldn't be couldn't be I mean we don't know we could see their faces\nAnd uh we could see the emotions I can understand that because it happens to me happens to my cousin in Sweden it happens so he could see those but we cannot judge because we don't know what really is in their house but if there was other people who came forward and set some other stuff one quarter of it\nShould take them out of the things and put somebody else\nExactly I think that's going to happen\nBut I'm not I'm not I'm Still not going to ... ... overtime a humble molested me my God I'm just [laughter] where was this um I go [laughter] I said for your call bell thank you very much was alright get back to work with you know\nHi thanks for your call bell thank you very much was alright get back to work or anything by by by higher on the radio hello\nGood morning Hi Hi Steve I'm I I think this whole thing is like like he was saying we don't\nSome people have said believe her some people believe him I Can't I'm more on his side but I really don't know what happened it was so long I mean even if you kill someone yesterday say I was ... you know someone who was asked me there's never any proof\nYou cook you could do it than that I can say well let's talk testify against the ocean\nIs now in her case they were people there who could have testified that Trump made it so that the asked me I couldn't do that\nOh that yeah that that's I don't that's what I mean it's it's ... it's so politicized though it's I don't I don't know I I just think I like the way they do it in England to\nMhm yeah I Want to hear more study of I mean I Know that happens real\nFor us but it's I think we should be more responsible but\nIt's just an accusation\nTrue or not like I said I really don't know ... I mean you can it's some some are going to report it and make her side look credible with his wallet and ... and you could go back and forth all day depending on where we\nAll my ... my problem with the whole thing initially was um ... this was\nThis was a teenage stupid drunken teenage action\nAnd I wasn't sure that I Would want to be held and I never drank but I Would not want to be held for some of the decision I made before my brain matured\nYeah um you know at Seventeen ... I made some very dumb unique him boy and soda to ... but now I Would say that ... ... I guess most people wouldn't look at me and it was any better [laughter]\nWell that's a whole other point in the eighties\nIt was any better [laughter] well that's a whole other point\nIn the eighties I was I was in college and at that and in those years and I'm not saying I've made mistakes tool but not not to that level but drinking it was more culturally it was more normal which wasn't\nRight yeah times have changed your right\nI I think you have to look at the lens and I'm not saying ... excusing Kavanaugh but it was a different\nCulture yes it was about what let's wait and see what happens now that would be if it national diversity graduate\nWell go ahead go ahead go ahead to do\nIt it's just I think we don't realize you know we were looking at everything like like we are today in back in the eighties\nYou know it's like you can't compare that I'm not saying what people did years ago was right but there is there is one thing I Will say for her side because people say why did you wait for my cousin\nTold me last week she was about ... smaller station and how she was thirty when the memory started coming back I read about that but she told me that it just blew my mind so I can understand that is not an argument so I didn't really know about that until I actually experienced someone that told me about it\nFrom happening all over the country right now yeah\nSo I mean I if I guess we have problems with people that that perverted 'cause it's everywhere [noise]\nWell I guess so but I mean I'm a I'm I'm Glad to see that a prison while I'm Glad you called and I appreciate your input um how what's taking so long to callers\n[laughter] what's taking so long the call I ask you first get busy okay some I [laughter] I sometimes I don't even I'm not even less than some weeks\nOh well no no no you got to call that we should do listen to those\nI don't even I'm not even listen to them we all know no no you got to call that we should do listen to those that's the way [laughter] I was the one we want you to call this All right thanks a lot of vehicle part of a no problem are above a five a way to\nTo to Thirteen twenty telephone number to call five oh wait two two two and three to zero\nWell you're looking at me\nYeah the Kevin Kevin I think we're gonna we're gonna see that boy pitch a fit like that on the I I bet I bet that the people who are already on the Supreme Court\nMay be without one the last one Gorsuch probably didn't mind but I bet the other ones I've got\nA couple of becoming a little concerned and and um well let's see what happens I mean it's nothing in the world in the people who are worried about the Robie weighed\nUm well it would just be Nineteen twenty four again yeah and that's all yeah no they gave you exactly well this is why I I've been against the roadway thing because it I mean excuse me uh I'm In favor of or we we are because you're not going to stop\nOne abortion by outlawing it know that one mhm no\nAnd since that's not what you want to do rich woman\nWill get abortions anytime they ... as they always have yet well sure and so it's very unfair against the poor again yeah if you get enough money ...\nYeah well that's the thing ... that's the thing so I mean ... what we have to do is train people to understand that it is wrong to opt for that and you get it from the base\nLevel from the core yeah the strangest thing is that people who who are so opposed to abortion are opposed to birth control and he\nSaid well no not all of them but I'm not a lot of oil and then you've got to a majority of ...\nYeah yeah well maybe\nYou've got to a majority of them do yeah\nYeah well maybe I don't know I mean I'm a I think a lot of these the ... are are pro birth not pro life right think France yeah that pro pro birth and I'm pro life\nYou try to give him a baby that was just born that the mother died two and ... that no other relatives and it probably won't take the baby and raise it yeah it's you know\nYou know and that's the other thing is what I had a big big route one time on the recent now and go talking about this stuff you know you're going to force that girl to have that child [noise] no\n[laughter] [noise] yeah maybe maybe the girl you know they talk a lot about the\nUm the depression and the disappointment in the sadness of a young girl has an abortion years later the guilt\nSometimes guilt mhm well there's also you know it can be guilt yeah um you know knowing that you did the right thing\nSecretary and everything booking a procedures but see it because she didn't say abortion he was like the procedure\nAnd you need to bring and she's talking on the phone to somebody who's calling about it you need to bring a you know hospitals has anything to you know whatever

I think what\nAnd we're not talking about well yeah but we're not talking about extraordinary circumstances they're talking about contractual they're talking about what you said privatization they're talking about corporate and what we're talking about is if they have the opportunity corporate as an opportunity to say or we can make that fourteen hundred I'm not talking about during\nA tragedy or I'm Talking about every day okay if they can say that a nurse\nCannot limit the number of patients they're involved with\nMhm basic mhm then that's a problem from uh\nMhm basic mhm\nThen that's a problem from a nursing standpoint from a medical student\nSay you would vote yes or no if you lived in Massachusetts for that\nI don't have enough information based on what you've told me you know what I'm saying is there's two different one in one now is it now the hospital site is well if we can ... if we have to limit the number Gary highly nations we have to limit the number of patients\nRight in the hospital makes less money well not only made me less money but it's going to ... yeah it's going to write it's going to cost them more money\nOr you may not be able to let everybody and you have to yeah\nSo that's one thing the other thing is you know now you say okay well we're going to limit the number okay if I use it or we're not going to limit it now what kind of treatment am I going to get what kind of attention to my right on this nurse who stretched to the nth degree\nTrue everyday mhm mhm yeah they are\nSo it's not a yes no question to me because I don't want to know really\nYeah it's really been bugging\nMind and I want to know and and I can see a nurse coming in and and arguing either side of that either side ... right on a\nOh yeah yeah I can and they probably they they are and they will but the ... the way you vote is is um is crucial that's\nGot to know where you're voting on that doesn't tell me what I'm voting on because that says to me read them want to read number when you go\nIf you vote yes it limits the number of patients that could but who wants it it doesn't nurses limit or does the\nHome and that's been underwater criteria is that a million and here's another thing I we're limited number of patients in ah ICU or we let any number of patients in maternity yeah that's what I mean literally have raisins ER\nThat's why the nurses have to be free\nTrinity yeah that's what all we're literally have with the agency ER that's why the nurses have to be free to that so I'm going to vote no\nWell and that they have to be free but they have to be free to do to say no\nI won't let me get well that's part of being free then which way you go to the nurses\nCan say to the to the ah ... hospital owners this patient is is not safe here\nHaving done that okay but I you know so you go to vote no mhm so having done that now the nurses has ... has no place to stand because of telling her as the boss she's going to have forty patients today\nBut they don't do that now that this wouldn't check with the vote no there's no change in the current laws\nWill recover laws obviously sucked because that's where they're trying to get a\nChance [noise] I I don't think that's why they're trying to get a ... to try to change will because because the nurses are\nAre overworked understaffed it would mean that would mean that the hospital left to hire more right is right what's the hospitals doesn't want to do ...\nThe houses are in favor of it\nNo not all the nurses that an ... say that the nurses will vote say vote yes\nI'm confused on you know because it's very confusing that's why I Want to have these people on running away but anyway question number three\nIs relevant to to the um the gas that uh that Elaine head on I don't remember the the lady's name she has a show on friday\nOr ... or ... or ... yeah and it it has\nTo do with a a law that prohibits based on gender identity in a person's admission or to treatment and he's place a public accommodation so bathrooms most mostly\nThe public accommodation so bathroom\nMost mostly and a yes vote we keep in place the current law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and places a public accommodation so you I Would vote yes to that a yes vote a no vote would repeal this provision of the public accommodation law\nWhich means you'd have\nLooney people's monitoring the bathroom and and pollution eating men's shoes and pins in in a bathroom hosing problems\nAround you're on the radio hello hello Ah yes you're on the air young I\nOkay ah in response to question number one yes that you've been talking about a Gretchen Robinson had\nA speaker or to the a couple of weeks ago on her program that three broadcast on W.

they haven't done a play off each other so well they had any crying I don't know if I still have the wrinkles under my skin they just go off each other was it was a good time and I don't think David taking the time and he\nOf course he picks on the groups coming in you know 'cause he's not a sports guy tried out for the football team wants and\nHe said they drove him back on Ninety all Ninety pounds and the fence and it was all set plan so that was the end of his high school football ... and he's just so animate the way he explains it and then Donald plays off and then going\nOff on this tangent as all my God it's so funny\nMy side was still killing me from Latin culture you know let's change things to do they talk about I don't know if I can say on our it wouldn't be nice wouldn't be nice just I don't think I should say it and I'll just keep it to myself but it's again thank you for letting us ah let me help off 'cause I'm set up\nThe gear and oh my God he's in here again and you know when the train and he you know and he just goes off and I'm just trying to you\nKnow my big frame I'm trying to tip into but not being set against ... of having me on today that was really nice enough to do that great guy\nGreat show before a show and they always promotes us when we get on and I can cover a high school sports so um how long has a program in doing three is it three years now of four years four years so bright once you take down like that's all yours every now and he's ready now is\nUm\nUnfortunately you know of course will have the scores and conventions that was a sports messages\nUnfortunately you know of course will have the scores I can imagine this that was a sports massive just for a hill of the run down on the scores from friday Thursday and friday from last night in our local area now how long listed a little history on your how long have you been coaching\nFootball and stuff where you know where you're from and all that is just to get people little idea of what you're about\nAwesome um so I was born and raised in Providence Rhode Island on an authentic Providence Rhode Island I played my football was I started playing football my freshman year actually and hope high school\nShut up to the whole blue wave and um it did that and for about four years um I went to Rhode Island college I'm a graduate of Rhode Island college and they didn't have a football team a cool thing about that though is that they had a rugby team and I always joke than lineman I'm Brian sometimes and the other guys Lyman like hey I Want to play full back\nInside [laughter] I live on a jet right although I don't want to be running\nBacks our quarterbacks so um I didn't get to live the dream but when I played rugby at right now in college I became a wing back\nWhich is one of the ... so I got that experience and something and just like\nI think when you have that bug of playing football just being competitive athlete it just goes with you so when I arrived to Atlanta charter school at two thousand Fifteen um I took the first year of sort of like cultivate myself and just become a teacher and a better teacher leader and then the opportunity came up to become the football coach and I knew Brian and I knew\nAll the guys like Desmond you know and you know just like a lot of great students and they will again should try out for it and I became the coach in two thousand sixteen and like they say the rest is history\nWhen you go now Brian how long you're a junior Senate what a senior and you've been with the program all four years and if it is now did you play JV\nUm ah ah for my freshman year we had a freshman team um I Believe sophomore year of restarted JV team and we paid you\nUm I Believe sophomore year we started in ... in ... my junior year actually you know\nWas last year was it was a your sophomore year was ... and then junior and senior varsity\nI'm trying to do my paparazzi and do everything wondering what are ... girl a multi tasking thank you uh you know for all his on science she actually she's not on a sandwich or you're going to a wedding so ... so she's busy that actually you don't want to\nA little pamper 'em wife a bridal shower or whatever they call them and they all get together and they pamper each other up so she's there no opposition to play and play outside linebacker and offensive guard now um\nIs there anything and I always try to throw the set all the different teams were lucky to have on like little house having you what Bush what could you wish you could have done before to get yourself ready for the senior level is there anything you look back on now that you wish you could have got ready\nOr the getting ready for the game you probably taken in ours I Would open a gym and just came from up so I I kind of call myself a macho of myself I'm always in the gym as much as I can um what kind of motivation or do you try to find\nAs much as I can [noise] um what kind of motivation or do you try to sign to keep yourself focused knowing the game of football but just keep yourself mentally ready or funny test that you tried to get yourself into this\nUm a lot of times uh for me music definitely does or if he keeps me going keeps me just\nHad surgery and just thinking about what I have to do and I have to take care of music always hope also on\nOne of my favorite football players is very Lewis and I'm so like I just go on YouTube or whatever and just watch motivation was features just watching them play just on things like that it just makes me feel like I Want to be better and that's the type of thing that makes me want to keep working\nAnd then this this was the coach I'm\nSo far you guys are wins they matter as much at the end of the day I mean you just gotta stay active in the world and just keep going to have fun mhm um what do you try to actually uh put in\nAs a more of a more racial thing to your team just to keep them uh I guess focus on just keep going out there and just playing for the crowd and stuff and uh it does it put a smile on their face like what kind of motivation to you share with your team\nUm I Would I tell them to\nAppreciate what they had in front of them um I think being a high school student is\nAn awesome time in your life um I think to play a high school football is one of the greatest things like you do I felt like some of the greatest in life so what I think for them it's like to appreciate what's going on I'm One of the things they had when I was in high school and I think Ron or take part of the British and I want to implement it in the football program at the last laugh\nYou know what I mean and basically the night before Thanksgiving game at my high school we did one last lap and you know\nThe night before Thanksgiving game\nAt my high school we did one last lap and you know the team based everyone else on the end of the helmets any sort of like rent them and and I think it's a it's sort of a time to really reflect and appreciate like basically all the sacrifices you made all the time that you spent to being a football player\nAnd sort of like what will life sort of like a archetype or around they're like yeah I'm Sorry architects like what you're going to actually go on that life is like a pre graduation right you've graduated on the football program\nSo I think for them I always tell them like this and appreciate for what ... what it is the bumps to bruises and everything else\nSee I wasted my time in high school I didn't really taking all the fun that was out there all the football games the basketball games all just a more stay at home kid yeah and ah I just I Try to\nReach out to more of those opportunities in college came around but going back to appreciating what's there and I just I Wish I took that and I really do um so I Would play a few while you just said coach like\nYeah if if there's a lot of fun out there you could then ugly it's hard to stay focused at times but\nFootball perfect uh football program like this is something or if you're not actually playing sport you got to leave to go out there and support the team and uh like we talked about earlier before the show actually started yet a good attendance yeah for for your last game that you played\nA so it really doesn't know winning losses really don't matter I Would think in in sports or at least for a high school program and it just about bringing people together and then you're having fun I Would think\nIt's one of those things that sort of like the rights of fall I always like to say it's like you know it's now up in spices everything it's it's nice hot chocolate in it I just like getting out they would just sweater and looking at your child on just looking at the school community I'm In sort of doing something as in it\nJust looking at the school community I'm In sort of doing something as in is so funny because last is where\nWe're pretty small schools or is it is such a family atmosphere so it's like ... just like playing a game in whether you're related someone or not it's like having aunts and uncles and moms and dads there you know he was you spend like eight hours a day and they're seeing you know be brave and\nStrive towards that goal so wins and losses I mean are important whether or not the end all be all without room\nNow to elaborate on um Max's I'm back to ... question previously so we have not qualified for a playoff ship right not yet okay 'cause nobody no I mean again we don't know we just\nYou know I thought that was a good question from him I didn't I didn't know what ... what conference you guys with with conference you argue independent currently wouldn't have been yes our what conference you're trying to get into\nA I Believe we're trying to get into the Mayflower conference the Mayflower yeah which I Believe are a lot of regional teams\nThere there are folks gather all folk shell out of now well that is that because the male enrollment is probably equal to what you have now is that the mentality on how to do you know\n[noise] um I don't know what I mean yeah I understand what you're saying I'm not too sure on that um I think a lot of times and it's something that can cause a thing as coach yeah sort of like um\nWhat other logistics and a lot of the rules you know am I not entering into a conference 'cause that's something when you're talking about building a tradition building a program especially building rivalries right I mean you want to keep a regional and you want to keep it close by\nAnd I still believe that they play by NC double a rules yes right so that's not too bad to Fisher yeah you're up in football college kids like that and um so that's under again we're just trying to get everyone familiar with the program you know great to have you on the bottom half of the hour I don't want to get\nThe sports mass of all the scores that we have available to us from Thursday and friday night so right now unfortunately at a big game\nBut we'll do us from Thursday and friday night so right now unfortunately had a big game or that came up short you know what are we what are we want to know I Know I'm Christian touching a little bit what's the biggest thing you want these kids to learn from this\nUm I think experience is the best teacher yeah I think one of the great things about being independent is that we play teams all of the Massachusetts\nEvery everybody ever I think maybe one day will that limits their right well yeah right exactly I Know for a New York and I they are the guys who knows maybe you could play worldwide [laughter] well it should be a worldwide\n... well I think it's something where like\nWe see how teams play in central Massachusetts right in northern Massachusetts um some and I think one of the awesome things against her law football tradition is the bus ride\nYou know I mean like we're traveling a lot of times and now we have the privilege of being at home but we're just seeing different styles of play 'em when we play a lot of the city schools you know I mean a lot of like we play Iraq's berries when you play your uh excel academies they're super athletic\nYou know I'm here says a lot of guys who play basketball in the winter and like they have a lot of transferable skills on when we play teams in the south coast I mean they still very much for the triple option\nSo I mean it's something where we're preparing defense for that and we rented one season um so we're just seeing so much in learning so much again me as a young coach us as your program you know writers you know football player you know I think Brian is gonna be an awesome coach one day\nAnd it's just like he just gets gets to see everything what no matter what we play\nNow brands that what you want to do do you want to coach\nA yeah it's something I'm looking into it and I are going to college and um when I get to college on a you know just looking at different things and uh and\nLike coaching really fitness training in a gym things like that nice others and\nUm between like coaching really finish training and Jim things like that nice all those things as interest so\nWould you ever want to coach a professional football\nUm I think that'd be pretty cool to do that but I Know that it would be a lot of time and a lot of studying so I mean I don't know until I get there I said I don't have any experience coaching so I'll see how I like it and maybe that can be a future\nSo that is that is your dream that you'd ... you'd like to coach we're well on a couple of something else you want to do to correct yeah that's cool that's cool so what what have you learned whatever you think you learn to uh to jump in a coaching thing what what's the big things that stick out to you by um [noise] there's\nA lot both athletically and mentally then I think I've learned just a how to be in my seat but also how to make yourself\nPhysically faster better shape I'm stronger things like that just always staying healthy also playing smart and things have there's a just a lot and I honestly can talk about it for so long but\nThat there's just I don't even know where to start because there's so much that goes into football that I never knew about before which is like I said before I Wish I knew about it right because just the amount of time you can spend getting better\nThere's no such thing as a perfect football player because there's always something else or exactly correct\nSee that coaches brand new my job [laughter] go is that our job coaches right exactly you get three years in the system at this level yet and you're already in ... instilled this young man with great work ethics good Leo the audio ... yeah exactly\nOr not I mean not to brag on Ryan but um I mean we're talking about Brian accolades on the football field he's also very accomplished that you know what I mean he's taking a math classes this year\nAnd students you know what I mean he's taking a do math classes this year to my clock says he's less as a piece of glass and financial algebra so like yeah he's a he's a Chinese on and off the field\nNow how many capitals do we have we have three cats and we have a DNA Toby Philips who's a junior at the school that we have ... a lock is who would have been here but he's taking SATs or SATs take priority absolutely right Alex Rivera or cheese who is a\nWho is often called el Toro you know what I mean he's awesome kid he's definitely a problem later on in school and he's always has like the best recommendations for Puerto Rican cuisine uh what\nNow what's our weight room like how we how we handle no way for them to keep him conditions that we have a\nShuttle scheduled for that how's that work out yeah right now I'm\nBasically a lot of guys are so right now we have a set of ... and that's something we'll look to develop um as we\nWe have a set of cow bells\nAnd that's something we'll look to develop um as we gather more space at our facility I think we have a set of cattle bells and a lot of guys we focus on a lot of ballistic movements so a lot of let's say I'm In I'm Sorry I was on what kind of ... and so I Know these exercise that's fine [laughter] I'm\nA lot of cattle belt swings a lot of shoulder prices and things like that\nThings where they can incorporate the core the hamstring the shoulders sort of build like impact\nYou know whenever they make a strike as a ... a football player\nRadio so so now we have an off season for part of an officer isn't condition program for for the uh went to Iraq or would be fall athletes\nYeah and so we have that and that's usually I'm I don't know of Brian enjoyed it but uh it was a\nSix thirty in the morning and uh we got guys arrive at six thirty in the morning and I'm sort of like an hour work out I was just like sprinting and just like a cat about lifting just sort of get them in shape and also a a lot of guys just lifted independently on own um workout world in Fall River is a really popular place and it's just like\nUm I got to see you guys like Brian ... am I think you to the ... the soccer guys with you and sort of just like yeah I got to see in bulk up so it's awesome it's one thing when\nI as a coach one guy's lift weights is another thing when guys take initiative you know to get ... get in shape on their own right\nMedication is key when it comes to stay in shape off I still go out of time but uh you know six thirty AM as there than what I Would do but\nUh you see they're doing a freedom of doing the rock Johnson he gets up like for during the morning and he killed in a gym he says there every day and does he does so much that his age and um he pulls a lot of this work out videos and stuff all of a social media\nOr anything that you or try to reach out to look on YouTube of fell into this\nThe thing that you or try to reach out to like on YouTube of fell into this many learn from and share with others the Seventeen\nYeah definitely um the reason why uh when myself and the coaches were deciding to you know have these guys live by six thirty one and it actually comes from a other peak performance like Michael Jordan and Mike Tyson and just the mindset of you know I'm working with my competition\nSo it's sort of a thing we're just like I didn't want to cultivate the attitude within the guys and it's also a thing where just like that's when I tell you is dedicated you know what I mean you I mean you arrive somewhere six thirty but\nTo get there by six thirty usually have to get up six o'clock maybe five forty five ... so you kind of get to know is like okay it's a it's an assessment who's areas and it was not serious\nI'm thinking this is this is a hockey program not a football [laughter] like you're going to rent the rent the six o'clock in the morning otherwise you lose your your looks yeah time I I I like to work\nAt it as much as ... to early in the mind for me to exercise\nMore now how's how's been out in the number that's a good point how how men the numbers have been held a number of doing that like at six in the morning for the most part\nUm we started outlets that involve like Fifteen guys and then it's like so you always do like are you break things down a third as a as a coach in any sport that's just like okay uh we have a large number now but it's like little drop of a third so if we had like Fifteen guys we had about ... gosh are regularly\nNow do you have a P. T. tests to give them before and after the season the see if they're going to work out world like they say they are well strength\nAlways start uh the first day of conditioning because at my ... birthday when conditioning right on with anything like that ah with sprinting and usually I think this year we did like about a we started off like with like thirty sprints and from that point you kinda see who's been working out\nUm and we also with us for your time\nFrom that point you kinda see who's been working out\nUm and we also with us forty times of us are as it for your time forty yard dash times right always see like if they made progress are they going to make progress a throughout the season\nOkay I was curious on that exactly I mean\nYou know sometimes the kids don't say what they do unfortunately and that kind of ... out a little bit because you're hoping they ... you know they want to play with they don't sometimes you know to their fault they don't comprehend yeah you know you're at a fast a level is the fastest level and all the high school football is the boss the level yeah yeah yeah\nAnd it's definitely I'm One of the one of the fun at times I think ... going to test this is a when a guy finally put on ... and we as a first day of like actual live eating because I read a lot of guys it's sort of like but yeah you know the biggest thing in the world yeah yeah just like oh we'll see\n[laughter] touched a right to the attack on the heart and the\nImpact could be could be like um they're strongly confident until they see what they're up against and they're like oh now I ...\nRight right exactly we're about to take a last break\n'em and then we're going to come back across them high like\nAtlanta try to correct things I like to try like man I don't do that that's just it's awesome yeah sketchy at this catchy I gotta get myself I had somehow that sounds a chef chef chef to pry but ... again ... ... if you want to call in when we come back five oh wait two two to one three to zero\nAgain with coach Thompson and Brian ... senior football player at Atlanta's charter a\nFootball program will be back with more right after this\nOn October thirty six thirty AM the center for reconciliation will host the hidden history of the second amendment a presentation by Carl ... the role of St John located to serve\nA presentation by Carl T bogus a cathedral of St John located at two Seventy one north main street in Providence\nThis is a free discussion on the history of the second amendment and how it intersects with the history of slavery in the United states guests will also have the opportunity to learn from local organizers about gun control activism today\nCarl gee bogus is a professor of law at the Roger Williams University School of law he has written and spoken extensively about both the second amendment and gun control policy\n[noise] you want it to the new yes please have a seat\nSo here's the thing when this company brought you on we took a chance on you you didn't have that four year college degree we typically look for right but we gave you a shot anyway and since then you've worked incredibly hard and given that you're all thank you been an important asset to the team but I don't think you can be an intern here anymore\nWe want to hire you your your theory is absolutely\nFind your next grade employee introduce yourself to the grads of life\nWho are they telling worth knowing about young adults have unique determination and experience and I deal fit for your company and an entry level position internship or even mental shape they might not have every qualification you typically look for but they're exactly\nWho you're company I won't let you down I Know don't miss out on a resource many innovative companies have already discovered go to grab the wiped out or to learn how to find and cultivate and train this great pool untapped\n... by the ad council and grounds of life dot org\nClaudine those auto repair located at three ten south main street in Edinburgh is celebrating twenty five years in the auto and truck repair business\nOver the years John ... and his team up mechanics of work to build a long lasting report with their customers from oil changes to diagnostics transmissions and routine maintenance on foreign and domestic cars and trucks Claudia\nTransmissions and routine maintenance on foreign and domestic cars and trucks ... will keep your vehicle running bloody nose auto repair five zero eight two to six eighty five forty five or at ... dot com [noise]\n\nHey welcome back you're all listening for these four star Carol new stations ... am W.\nA.
