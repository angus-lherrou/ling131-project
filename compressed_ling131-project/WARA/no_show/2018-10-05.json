conditions and that we have a lot more all these coming your way yeah we've got quite a number of people already\nEmailing us and we'll get to those in just a couple of moments we are going to check in with Jim though with the latest updates on the forecast gym\nWell normally have cooler weather moving in or from last night in fact the temperature was still in the mid sixties a little after midnight so another one of these nights and early mornings where we have a cold front pushing through now the sun will went out today for a little while early this morning a deck of broken clouds coming in from the northeast\nEspecially up over towards the route twenty four Carter but overall a nice day coming up with sunshine prevailing high temperatures reaching sixty so not much of a different from what it is right now probably a drop a little for the next hour then go up a couple of degrees then kind of hold steady again those breeders out of the north northeast or age Eighteen if you've got so over twenty\nTwo early afternoon and then tonight cleared diminishing winds finally we have a night where the guys should be mostly clear and that'll allow the temperature to fall to the low forties as we said earlier the last time we saw that was made for so a little while whether a case of about five months of about four days last time we saw that\nHowever it will moderate quickly tomorrow at sunrise course good news for the farmers market tomorrow yet again mostly sunny highs and the low in mid sixties in the afternoon falling back to the fifties tomorrow night and then the warm day for the holiday weekend is Sunday by a few degrees low in mid seventies in the afternoon the southwest when\nA Monday sun and clouds highs and the mid sixties again isolated sprinkle like we had last night and a few spots low impact than Tuesday and Wednesday back into the seventies probably lower mid seventies Tuesday kind of like today and then we have a shot\nIn the seventies probably load mid seventies Tuesday kind of like today and then we have a shot at eighty degrees Wednesday and perhaps Thursday of next week we will have to monitor the Caribbean still we have been over the last few days and they're still area of low pressure there just to the east of belief which is to the south of\nThe cause of valley area and uh that looks like it's going to form into something this weekend and then a vest especially by late this weekend and some of that could move into the Gulf Coast areas somewhere or sometime this early next week\nAnd some of that most will get get swept up as I've been saying last two days late next week could be a wet windy kind of a situation a with showers and a front in some of that remnant tropical moisture so that's something to consider I Would say through probably most of the Thursday before we started to go downhill in terms of some rain six twenty\nThe sunset today a reminder again a month from yesterday or or essentially think about it as four weeks from this weekend is when we set the clocks back one hour a low tide coming up around ten thirty by the way the water temperatures are still not bad but this time of the year\nOr so I still a few areas sixty six sixty seven degrees or you could still maybe Sunday consider going into the ocean yeah go to the beach the water will be a little bit cooler than the air which is unusual in October so if you're someone who likes a late season swim Sunday with lowered mid seventies\nOr maybe a shade less warm in that at the coast but still\nThat might be an actual late very late season beach day for some and then\nA tomorrow in Monday we'll be the more invigorating fall like days in terms of temperature or by the way on this date a we had a close call with a hurricane but we also are noting that what happened the other day I don't know if you heard there was a tornado in Mansfield how 'bout that did not hear that and now I did not\nYes but it was not Mansfield mass where I Am it was Mansfield, Connecticut\nKnow I did not yes but it was not Mansfield mass where I Am it was Mansfield, Connecticut which is over the border and it was a F zero tornado so it was the quote unquote weakest of the tornadoes\nBut it was bad enough that it was a thirty miles wide thirty miles trees thirty yards wide and just under a half mile long cause damage to some trees some rotation some shingles would often a couple of houses but that's about the type of damage you would get with that Seventy mile an hour winds I bring that up again because\nAs I said earlier this week this was looking at a lot like Nineteen Seventy nine October where we had severe weather late in the season we had some very warm conditions a foot overall conditions again obviously today is uh an exception but overall it was very warm and of course that same year\nAh will buy might as well throw it in now since we may not be talking till sometime next week on a for next week the anniversary of the earliest snow fall\nOn record in the adult borough area uh which was the ninth and tenth of October Nineteen Seventy nine now again in Seventy nine we also had an early snow falling Seventy seven but we did have a dusting\nIn that season and that was followed by\nThe earliest or or lack of snow fall or for the fall and winter and that's why I'm Still thinking even though you know we've had some of the same things playing out it looks like whatever happens this winter and already people have been asking\nAre the first half of the winter still looks like it's going to be warmer than average now it might only take one big snowstorm and then the rest of the winter is still above average so you have to consider that but uh just very interesting that we have we're still setting up for\nWhat very well could be overall a low impact winter of snowballs which after last march or is I think a good thing for many people\n... who wants to see what happens is the how mild it is coming up in the next\nRight well who wants to see what happens is the how mild it is a coming up in the next couple of months\nFor the good of you here is so there was a tornado in Mansfield it was not Mansfield mess it was Mansfield, Connecticut over over by the University of Connecticut thereby stores ... pounds over and I'll have another updates on next\nOkay All right Jim thanks so much Jared let's continue boy I tell you we have a what we're ... we're starting to get them down with something to break them down I Know that I'm just I'm just going to say one thing right now I just got

really do make us happy right\nThe remote correspondent wrote in bugs make us happy\nHugs from plugs puts his right over the top right wow I Want if Derek mall hang out a new phone number that might have been from him I don't know but wow\nIt due to twenty four says thanks I missed the boat to ... on the ice to their face comment so like age I'm forty eight yesterday ... three six to nine was making a joke mhm you're supposed to have a sense of humor he LA\nNot being serious and I just hoops groups so I'm Glad I played that song I'm Sorry but how has flowers okay anything else are we should know up\nNow so it's down to four down to four senators like flip flop the two women you know you have one from Alaska\nMurkowski violence from Maine correct a than a democratic ... above a with Jeff Flake\nFlake yeah yeah and then and then the Democrat\nYeah is it like she's a democratic senator from a red state is oh let's\nSay he oh no there's a woman to know she came out this morning and said that she will be she won't be voting for him\nYeah right yeah but she's a Democrat as you under arrest date but yeah\nSo you can you can count on all Democrats to be no yeah\nI think if I was\nYou can you can count on all Democrats to be no\nI ... if I was ... if I Believe\nIt or he whether he committed sexual assault or not you know the Democrats were going to be no either way yes\nWell his temperament is completely\nNo no no that this could have been Neil Gorsuch is to have been anybody you know it's a party line vote we\nKnew how to write an editorial in the wall Street Journal basically saying ignore ignore my confirmation hearings name or the hearings for judge Ford I'm really not that much of an entitled jerk and I can be impartial I'm Sorry it's too late if I was a Republican consultant\nGuy so we can do better no no I I we only get like an old you this I Would have cut this guy loose a long time yeah but my point is a Justice Sotomayor was was party line vote Gorsuch was ... party line vote\nPeople who had nothing in there nothing scandalous in their background it's all a party line vote it's the Merrick Garland\nCouldn't get a hearing for eleven months I understand has this was when Republicans you can say the Democrats were obstructing but you don't get the moral high ground\nAnd you don't get an adult can about all of a remote doesn't have any no no no what I'm saying now I'm Talking more to remote correspondents here because Republicans you started this mess by not giving Merrick Garland a hearing\nAnd then you got to look up Merrick Garland a what's under his picture hysterical you talk about pristine clean as a whistle right Merrick Garland was a guy just two years previous two years previous\nRepublicans were talking about what a great Supreme Court judge he wouldn't be but no Democrat whatever consider him then Obama considered him and they wouldn't even give him a searing so you can you can complain about the Democrats doing whatever they can to stop\nTo stop a Brett Kavanaugh but you you don't get the moral high ground you wouldn't even give Merrick Garland a hearing mhm wow\nYou don't get the moral high ground you wouldn't even give Merrick Garland a hearing mhm wow\nRight and trust me if I was a conservative a consultant guys guys can we find a nice white woman ... who wants to overturn roe v Wade who doesn't believe a president sitting president can be indicted trust me they are out there right now our own good conservatives for your own good right move in another direction\nAnd when the when the Democrats take twenty twenty Eighteen they take the midterms my production will be RPG will step down at that point Ruth Bader Ginsburg right yeah because you know\nThat they'll never Trump if yeah\nIf another a vacancy where to come about he would never get anybody confirmed\nYou wouldn't even come up for vote why like Merrick Garland yeah why would root get better Ginsburg stepped out she was only a hundred and Seventy four years as yeah can't keep her head up yeah only takes er about thirty six minutes to actually walk up the steps to get to wear seat behind the bench right groups but um\nBut I I don't think there's any doubt in at least in my mind that the Democrats are taking twenty eight\nI Hope so there's no doubt in my mind but I but the greater point to all of this is is um\nNot good for the country for us to be so divided gosh darn it and I use my old house analogy again\nYou know the Republicans wield the foundation do the framing and the progressives they're the ones who keep the house of the cold is it ages and goes on they put in the new granite countertops they put in the plumbing so you don't have to go to the well anymore ooh look our lexical wiring us all screwed up this whole house my burned down the progressive come in and\nPut a new electrical wiring up to code ooh ooh ... it's the houses us together it's not one or the other ... and gosh

sprinkles last night low impact up you were inside you know even happened wasn't even up to what the ground and still not ... north north north east wind or the temperature yet this fall the temperature at when I came out with ...\nNorth north east wind or the temperature yet this fall the temperature at when I came on with Don at six o'clock this morning\nOn average around the area was it a fifty seven fifty eight degrees it is still right around fifty seven fifty eight degrees despite the fact that the sun has been up almost four hours and that's a tip off that ... cooler air masks moving in a what do you showing by the way by the window\nFifty nine degrees outside Seventy two degrees inside\nWhile the important thing is that Seventy two and a couple of months ago it was more like Ninety two in that room but no but anyways yeah it's a\nNice and comfortable out there that do points get this going to fall later this afternoon and I think you'll know why I'm saying this to about thirty nine ... and so that means that tomorrow morning well guess what we're going to see the coolest weather we've had\nIn a little over five months in terms of the temperature now a ... you know we do have some of these puffy clouds you can see the rolling in northeast of southwest\nOr they've actually yeah they're only have two thousand feet and that's why you can see the moving pretty quickly the closer the clouds are to use the fast they look like they're moving so uh that's the way it will be today but a lot of blue skies as well\nAgain right around sixty that's it I'm not going to change much at all\nA good news for the football games Paul they'll still be a bit of a breeze that will begin to diminish early this evening or no moon out tonight the moon won't be until later months but uh it'll be clear and it will be cooling off quickly I Would say down about fifty say around nine o'clock because that is more than two and a half hours after sunset\nSo we're looking at fifty at nine o'clock or the cooler temperatures we've seen a bad time are so far this season and then about forty to forty three tomorrow morning\nNow that would be the coolest and the more rural location to a more urban centers maybe forty six forty seven but bottom line the coolest morning tomorrow I looked at my records you have to go back to me first\nBlind the coolest morning tomorrow I looked at my records you have to go back to me first of this year are where we were down around forty degrees and then about two days later you\nGet into our first first a spell of hot weather two days later but me five month what\nWhat point of order I have a question um you often referred to you consult the record you went back and look at your records or your records handwritten and pen or pencil in a notebook are they notes on a computer or they screen shots exactly what are\nYour previous records and how far back do they go\nOh well actually I have some records when I first was a kid go back to Nineteen Seventy two but why they are account they are calendar like Kavanaugh I keep my God no I'm only kidding no uh no not seriously but no I write that down in on occasion\nI put them into the computer but no Ninety five percent of what I Do is written down\nAnd I know you like to hear that not written down in the computer but I you know some of it does go in but yeah so it is written down that I did check early this morning at five o'clock when I was analyzing things are and I noted that may cause I was wondering when was the last time as I'd like to call it in a while whether yeah last time\nInto the low forties and sure enough it was may first of this year getting just a little over five months ago so if you like it really cool are you like tomorrow morning however if you do leave your windows open tonight or you'll really feel it in the morning unless you're prepared for that than modeled sunshine law wouldn't be sixty so we get a little bit milder tomorrow afternoon Paul and then the\nStill looks like Sunday for the holiday weekend including making Monday holiday as well obviously Seventy three is what I'm going for a for a high on Sunday\nOr

agenda\nAmerican people deserve to know in response\n\n\n\nWill thank God a woman listened to her deepest boys I mean we know that one out of three women in the world will be beaten and raped we know that\nWas in his millions of survivors across this country are feeling that they are not being believed that they are not being listened to that their concerns are not being taken seriously this after ... years and years and years of work it feels like something that is just totally unacceptable\nOf worse it feels like something that is just totally unacceptable\nYou have written so many books most recent in the body of the world um you wrote a letter in time magazine can you share it with us today I'd be happy to talk about why you particularly address white women here well\nOne of the main reason I'm addressing white women as the statistics that specific say that most white men support Kavanaugh forty five percent of white women support him thirty percent of Hispanic women and eleven percent of of of African American women\nI mean the number and African American something like eating more than eight percent of African Americans are opposed to judge yes\nRight and uh let only eleven percent believe are supporting him so I again was astonished by this and I just went into my soul and I felt like I wanted to reach out to those women to talk to them so I wrote them this letter they're white women who support Brett Kavanaugh\nLast night when I saw Donald Trump mock duck to Dr Christine Blasey Ford I couldn't help focusing on the women behind him who chaired a left\nI felt like I was falling into a familiar nightmare it compels me to reach out to you when I was a child my father sexually abused and beat me\nMy mother did not protect me she sided with my father just like these women sided with Donald Trump and I understand why she sided with him because he was the breadwinner\nShe sided with him because of her needs to survive she sided with him because the reality of what was happening in front of her was so terrible it was easier not to see she sided with him because she was brought up never to question him and\nShe was taught to serve man and make them happy she was trained not to believe women it was only much later after my father died that she was able to acknowledge the truth of my childhood and to ask for forgiveness it was only then too late that she was able to\nChildhood and to ask for forgiveness it was only then too late that she was able to see how she had sacrificed their daughter for security and comfort she use those words I was her sacrifice\nSome people when they look at this video of women laughing as Dr Ford will see callousness icy distancing I see denial I've worked on any violence against women for Twenty years I have traveled this country many times I sat with women of all ages and political persuasion Z\nI remember the first performance of my play The Vagina monologues in Oklahoma City when women has two women in the audience came up after to tell me they had been raped or abused\nMost of them whisper to me and often I was the first it only person they had told\nUntil that moment they had found a way to normalize it expected accepted deny it\nI don't believe you want to choose your sons and your husband's over your daughters I don't believe you want the pain was expected on us inflicted on future generations\nI Know the risk many if you take coming out to say you believe a woman over a man it means you might have to recognize and believe your own experience if one out of three women in the world have been raped or beaten it must mean some of us had this experience\nTo believe another woman means having to touch into the pain and fear and sorrow and rage of your own experience and I feel some bearable sometimes I Know because it took me years to come out of my own denial and to break with my perpetrator my father\nTo speak the truth that risk up ending the comfort of my very carefully constructed life\nBut I can tell you that living a lie is living half life it was only after telling my story that I knew happiness and freedom I Know the risk others have you face who witnessed those you love suffer the traumatic after effects of violence and those who worry for both your sons and daughters that they may someday face the silence\nI write too because we need you\nIs that they may someday faces silence\nI write too because we need you the way I once needed my mother we need you to stand with women who are breaking the silence in spite of their ... and shame I Believe inside the bodies of some of those women who laughed at the rally were other impulses and feelings they weren't expressing here's why I Believe you should take the stand with me\nViolence against women destroys our souls\nIt ... our sense of self it ... us it separates us from our bodies and it's a tool news to keep a second class citizens and if we don't address it it can lead to depression alcoholism drug addiction overeating and suicide it makes us believe we are not worthy of a life of happiness\nIt took my mother forty years to see what our denial had done and to apologize to me I don't think you want to apologize to your daughter's forty years from now\nStop the ascension of a man who was angry aggressive\nVengeful and could very well be a sexual assault her time is short polio senators stop laughing and start fighting\nSlur award winning playwright and author of The Vagina monologues and so much more founder of the day [noise] eve before we go to break and then talk to about this remarkable day of the Nobel Peace prize and what it means for everyone\nI wanted to ask you about the significance just as you said you started to perform The Vagina monologues and so many women came out saying they've been abused or raped\nThis week in these last week so many women have spoken out about their sexual assaults against them for the first time\nIt's as if the whole country is suffering from ... and and I want to say to all the survivors\nThe whole country is suffering from ...\nI Want to say the oldest survivors your\nMatters your experience matters what you've been through matters the the trauma that you have faith matters and that there are many of us many of us supporting you loving you holding you as you try to heal from the six the areas that that that mass of\n... patriarchal massaging this white men do not reflect so many people in this country the Senate\nJudiciary Committee and um the Republicans on it um our old white men and there has never been one Republican woman on the Senate Judiciary committee and all of us\nHistory and I think the fact that fifty five percent of the jail pay has said that a person being a sexual assault or shouldn't prevent them from being on the Supreme Court is an indication of how entrenched how deeply entrenched sexual violence a massage and he is in the Republican Party\nWhen we come back the Nobel Peace prize goes to two people one man and one woman who ... has worked with on\nFighting sexual violence stay with us\n\n\nOn line\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nTwo\nWorld we\nLive on and we\n\nBreak the chain music

and used as a weapon of war an armed conflict and I think this award hopefully will signal to the world I'm particularly to men\nThat there is a different way of being you know that we have to honor survivors we have to honor women like not even allowed to stand up and we have to say the men\nThere is in a way you can you can devote your life to any violence against women you can to like do you like to working within standing beside us and you don't become less of a mad you become more of a man and more of a human\nI mean we only have to meet Dr ...

I'm ... I'm a senior this year he already graduated\nExcellent ah do you um do any vocational or C. T. E. program type things or\nA no no I'm I'm I'm you know the kids so I've I put like buy extra space towards the music program\nBe mad about I guess I mean obviously it's very frustrating but at the at the end of the day it's like I just let them be negative and let them be ignorant and just say you know whatever like it closed mind doesn't gonna get you anywhere and I just kind of try to move on with my day\n... that's great I commend on Facebook as well yeah I did the letters that did individual letters to each and my family immediate family members\nUm just I think yeah I think their emails or snails I Can't remember it was it was about two years ago but then I did the big one on Pittsburgh because they've been sufficient and I got this I did this big long essay um\nAnd I had my desk at the time proof read it for me and uh actually she'll be in a few weeks um to talk and then um\nThen I got like all his responses and they just kept coming in the mail like I like love love love you know and then in the morning I had like twenty more you know and just family friends and stuff and [noise]\nI just started making a lot of more friends yeah like crazy and like [noise] on so blessed\nI honestly after my transition I found it a lot\nAnd like [noise] it was a blast yeah I honestly after my transition I found it a lot easier to connect with people and you know unlike because I was just I'm I was myself I can like present the way that I Want to act the way that I Want without having to feel like\nIt's kind of trapped in a box I guess like after I came out I was just like there was like ... almost like an lighting and it was like it's really it's like a real big life change or [noise]\nSo do you feel like you had more friends after your transition to do you feel like you have a really good support system now\nOh yeah my support system is incredible I honestly cannot ask for a better butter group to have around me I always feel like I'm you know like when I Know what I'm sad or when I'm sitting up sac and go to them and they can just trim me up and it's just like even though I'm not I'm I'm happy it's great to be around them when I'm happy it's it's it's awesome I couldn't ask for like any more people that I'd want around\n... excellent that's wonderful yeah when I'm looking at chase in like a J isn't ... J. yeah my looking at him he looks like any other ordinary young man ... yeah\nAbsolutely and I think that's my kind of my point of bringing un today because you know\nEverybody deserves the right to do what we need to do by going to school and going to work or even going out to different places and you know that's what this\nPublic accommodations law is all about really you know it so that everybody can go to you know parks and hotels and restaurants and that's what public uh combinations are that you can go anywhere in the city and the state in the country\nAnd to as the person you are but also be able to go to public bathrooms as the\nIn the you know but the bathroom that you identify as ... and um\nSo what does it what do you think that this means to you what do you um how are you affected by it\nThe most like\nHow are you affected by it\nSo the most like All right so the where I'm going to start off with this um with the whole public accommodations things to the bathroom this is like the big this is like what everyone is usually like the most upset about\nThat is what the opposition is coming at us yet out is the ... the bathrooms\nAnd it's like first of all that's the basically the only place that they can pinpoint and say oh yeah there's a quote unquote potential problem here and they're trying to push the fact that [noise] they think that\nPeople with perverted intentions can come in and take advantage of using the bathroom like of when trends in individuals want to use the bathroom that they feel most comfortable and and I think that's a lot of bogus because\nUsing their logic if they were to get what they wanted I Would be using the females bathroom and I feel like that's something that they don't\nAnd you know what you would then be looked at like oh my gosh there's a guy coming into the female bathroom what the heck\nYeah and they doing that [laughter] the point where they're going to police this and how are they going to really allowed at all to happen\nYeah there's no you can't really have a check with that you know like that's the thing how are they going to how they going to like enforce this rule it's just\nIt's really insane to me because they don't even taken the other considerations like hotels parks like they're not talking about this they're only target targeting the bathroom so it's almost like they're using as a scapegoat just to protect their own ... stop\nThis from going forward and you know staying on the books which is totally isn't about the bathroom oh it's about everything and you know like you were saying how we're going to police it made me standing at the door saying okay let's see you're done it was right now [laughter] yeah like that\nYeah they're not there's there's no way like even if this were to be repealed there's no way of\nThey're not there's there's no way like even if this were to be repealed there's no way of\nLike going about this in a sense that's like morally correct It's kind of right it's very it's just very insane to me right I I agree and it's very um\nOffensive really you know for people especially in this state in Massachusetts the one that was the first to pass them marriage equality law in two thousand four dozen for the first one it's kind of like the um what everybody looked at\nYou know they passed it and everything has gone great with that you know the sky hasn't fallen [laughter] we're still here and people can get married and it's\nExciting you know it do that in sixteen is when this um was put into this law and what's happened since then has there been people who they have um have gone against Islam you know with evil intentions has there been any report that no\nThere is something I Want to say about this too is that I'm a mini this ah folks that I've talked to a run into who are us his head or a normative which means ... meaning not trans and straight [noise]\nSome folks me believe that because I've transitioning from male to female that's how I get to sleep with men and that's the logical because men will sleep with a man and whatever\nYou know this this isn't Iran ... I'm too we live in the state of grace and whether I Am a Christian or not which I Am\nStill nobody has any right to judge another person\nUm as far as the bathroom thing the last thing I Would ever wanted to do to someone is just stripped their rights from them because that is not my\nYou to someone is just strip their rights from them because that is not my to do that is to play God is to say\nI care more about me and my welfare than you regardless if I knew you were not\nWhich is inherently arrogant and wars have started that way you know politics by force ... um as far as the bathroom thing also is well nobody has any right to tell another person how to live breathe eat 'em do anything\nWe cannot control persons places or things as much as we'd like to think\nWe can um it's a\nIt's it's really the simple I said in the last couple of times this is not a choice\nRight whether you're\nLesbian gay bisexual transgender questioning queer intersects a sexual\nIt is not a choice\nYou know this I'm Jay did not do this because he felt like it ... this is not a trend that this is not a fat and this is really serious business\nAnd why would why would any of you know why would any of us be algae Beatty just because just you know as a a fat why when all of the things and then the backlash and\nThe people who are against it why would we do it you know those micro aggressions that you say they still they still hit you they still do you know and to me to everybody and having to come out over and over again why would we do it just because\nI think people are scared that ... people are scared of things that they don't understand this has been going on for tens of thousands of years since the inception of the human race\nAnd um you know just one faction in key plant doesn't understand another\nUm you know just one faction and keep land the zones in another faction so we'll go and kill them so that we don't have to worry about it for the snow and guns are mhm I'm care which is ...

because it sounds better than textures we give them aged numbers because we love the show get smart getting ready to kick off left or right for over a AS number twenty six Remington army side on side low kick field it by Mike striking goes to his knees\nAnd feel that like a T ball third baseman got down on his knees and out of our all will begin to first possession moving right to left at their own thirty\nEight yard line [noise]\nThat's the ... you know it's funny you just don't see that in big time college football too often or you see this in high school were teams now they just say [noise] with we do this we will forego any opportunity for the other team you got the wrong return but given the ball to the other team on the thirty seven yard line\nI don't know yeah\nYou think camera in the white outright\nA rod and the slot back to pass we are going to have a lot of the first place Cameron is out there makes\nAnd it's taken down at about the twenty three yard line [noise]\nOf all of our aims to tackle made by number four team\nDarrin Waller caught\nWell it's just a they came out in an unbalanced to the right hand side the formation a wide receivers but with the right to you\nTo the right hand side the formation a wide receivers but with the right and he just ran the streak and it's a perfectly thrown ball actually a step on the throne but he was so open he made a nice grab on it and we don't even know yet how\nI Would say it was about a forty three are is that the twenty yard line started at their own thirty eight tough to read the lines down that end of the field I gave him forty racetrack in the fall back there is a tale back Cody running off right guard blast behind a block of Eddie per Rica he's close to another first out the ... of line\nHelene Charles left tackle ... the left guard would send the center per week of the right guard evidence that right tackle did their job on that play my second one second one just to a blast playoff right tackle but we used to call in isolation full back leads through picks up the linebacker\nAnd the running back breaks off that broke it outside picked up\nNine yards at the eleven yard line now a bit more of a spread formation Cody on the left camera and comes in motion right to life takes the jets we tend to off turns it up\nNice blocking out front for ... gets enough for a first down\nTaken down at the five yard line that will be first and goal gain of six and once again that's a place to see all the time on TV the wide outcomes flying across perfectly times snap\nQuarterback gets a snap I don't know if he flipped it to them and handed it to look at a call it a run yeah and I guess he got about six yards they they'd be up to the five yard line first and goal ... most of them left guard to the full back position and moving and it led to guard AS number seven Jacque Leo\nPower I write too tight ads they run that way which then cuts outside inside excuse me Cody cuts outside inside in the end zone [noise]\nAnd then four plays out over oh travel sixty two yards for six nothing lead I think that was just a in that was just straight blocking once again they had nice splits two titans and they just plastered right off guard and I don't think he was\nSplits two titans and they just blasted right off guard and I don't think Cody was touched\nAnd then in the end zone to carries Fifteen Years for Cody terrific run and he's the star of this year there's no question about that and with a would\nBe nice if they got the clock working but they haven't yet so I think it's ... times been kept on the field we are outside in the stands two years ago when we were here [noise]\nWe were in the press box but now here comes out to borrow when they're swinging gate formation striking the center Mike [noise] and now it's time out called by all of arranged you could have said he's the eligible center good point\nBecause when everybody's to your right and you're going to snap the ball with only a wing to your left yeah oh you are eligible\nAdult borrow as they used this formation a lot last year again the centered on the bulk of the line spread out to the right side haven't used it much this year because they're kicker Briggs Colby Briggs has been very effective\nI can mention this now that the game and started brings his leg is not a hundred percent tonight so out of our all breaking out this old to point conversion formation\nAnd now they are in a\nKicking formation\nThat's weird the kicker spot so now they shift striking the eligible centers snapping to his right Nick Evans to his left in the backfield Weatherford\nEveryone else way off to the right\nCody comes in motion right to left takes the jets wave running left wants to throw can't throw cuts it off the field you'll be taken down short conversion is no good [laughter] so early in the first quarter it is six nothing out of\nOur hard to describe that plan you have a center you have a guard right next to him you have the entire rest of the line five and strong split out ten more yards too you're right yeah I have a back behind him and then to the left of the center you have a wing back\nAnd then there's a quarterback back in the shotgun against the snap heads to the guy who comes racing for rights\nAnd then there's a quarterback back in the shotgun against the snap heads to the guy who comes racing from right to left\nAnd he was looking to throw back to the quarterback within the last two I think with all the bodies you couldn't do that [laughter] so we tried to make it did make it in six so for the blue bumpy as as we get started we wish we knew how much time was left in the first yeah but that's part of the clock is working in fact nothing is working up on the clock except the numbers are turned on\nYeah scored a six nothing even those scoreboard still says nothing nothing brings goldie breaks a sophomore uses sophomore right\nYes we'll kick off for out of our All right to left the wing gunners number five Ethan Cameron really a dynamite undersized underrated player got her on the left his number six my Kevin ...\nDeep for over a is number one\nPhysic and I believe number three short kick\nBubbles field and on his knees he is down near his own thirty yard line that was number forty four Nathan ... brawl started running back and linebacker he'll do the bulk of their running tonight after the terrible injuries suffered by their captain and returning leading Russia Anthony Brooks uh\nWhich is awful for Anthony to lose your senior year and you know what his fans it's awful for us he was fun to watch\nThose too and and it's you know college football is one thing but I you know have you always heard me say the most fun I haven't had thing or coaching football for the high school level\nSo here are oh eight at their own thirty yard line there first possession first and ten\nUnder a shotgun formation to preparing\nThe quarterback runs to his right it was an unbalanced line as well go to the right side they had a number Seventy eight is unless he's the tight end\nYou know I should I should have checked with the rules 'cause they do change change the rules are until very recently you were in eligible if you didn't have a number of eight hour above or forty nine and ... below\nRecently you were in eligible if you didn't have a number of eight hour above or forty nine and below\nOn a tackle a defensive end on the left Nick Evans weird was in there as well from his [noise]\nWe're we're came for the rights of its Avengers bought to help make that tackle on camera and it'll be second and nine\nFrom their own thirty one had my head down running back right off the mental good gain it'll be third and short they stepped into the short then it yeah that was snapped to number nine\n... Billy cat who plays defensive tackle on defense and that almost look like a single when wing play it certainly did look at his singer wing plane he picked up about six yard pictures down picked up ... yards there at their own thirty nine so the line of scrimmage must have been the twenty nine\nSo they're thrown thirty nine first antenna hitting left to right\nThere often is of line which\nHollande said depending on the formation will change a lot will give you that after this play it's a real tight formation shot gun all three back to their\nYou know that's a single information for sure [noise]\nRunning to his rights strung out Jason we're makes they hit on Nathan ... starting quarterback is number three San Stevens Mike so this is like a wild cat formation was Stevens a quarterback not camp parents and that was again a no game\nOr gain of one on that play by number forty four liberal at least five eleven one Seventy five there if they stop this forward progress they really didn't bring him to the turf\nSecond and for ... a from the forty heading left to right to own a line left tackle the costs of the left guard white center is a Anderson right guard the ... and the right to tackle the genie flip flop for for the bootleg fake tries to go left cuts it\nJeannie flip flop for for the bootleg\nFake tries to go left cuts it up the mental gains if you hit by Evans and hit by Woodson and he'll be taken down after a lack of forward progress he doesn't hit the mat either\nThat was a four four that was an old spinner play yes that was his fingerprints are telling the other thing is we've gone back fifty to sixty years minimum in time to see the old single information wow that is a wild\nGain of two for the quarterback\nOff right tackle cut back over the guard he literally I don't think he got ... got to getting into the end zone second CD game fifty yards and it carries right now\nTwelve zip with ten fifty six to go on a second there already lined up and they go into this red formation against second touchdown for Cody second time he ran right off any per week is about to get the end so it's a big bucks to go it's a good thing\nWho sneak on touch and it went nowhere [laughter] fails conversion again for adults are also they had an eleven play eighty one yard dry\nBorrow so they had an eleven play eighty one yard drive but again they fail to convert and it's twelve nothing ten fifty six to go second quarter\nWell so far out of our completely dominated the action they've held a while they did give up one first home to the [noise] the tigers in the first quarter yeah but they really looked awfully a dominant up front\nAnd once again when you're making using all these different formations but really it's old fashioned kind of football yeah you know against Kay pie\n... tried to go east west right with ... it's a it was probably the least effective outfits have shown we've seen in the five or six years we've heard Robin Leach they'll probably about it and once again when coaches make the right adjustments good things happen in\nOuter borough is this is just a much better I formation team in a wing tea style team in Cody is a tale batch yes yes let's get him in there you know they couldn't get him and he carries against the a K picks up the jet sweeps and that just didn't work\nMuch track and was saying in the perfect ... even Sam would be wide receiver yes but in this off and he's the Tehran ball base had kicked feel that their own twenty six by oh hey nice return up the middle still in his feet\nBall is loose maybe but he might have been down\nOut of it has the ball Alex Rodriguez comes out of the pile but no they're saying the runner was down it will be first and Ken Oliver arrange at their own\nThirty nine yard line like and I I thought it was I thought he was ... I thought he was done but whatever the case may be or send us once again ... just gives the opponents are pretty short field yeah and they've done a pretty successfully so who might a complaint I remember um\nYou know back in the day if your goal was seen in\n... in my day yes but you know you want it was that was horrible\n... in my day yes but you know you want it was on the phone bowl is it Oh yes I don't know what does it does happen it was a former I'm wrong again\nA rod senior captain recovers trips to the right\nWe're rolling right fires and he's got you track them\nDown I was going to say about the twenty five yard line\nSo I started at the thirty nine of old a last week Mike that pattern was open three different times and they couldn't get the ball to strike and his father head coach Mike ... told me today they're going back\nTo it and there they did this Fifteen yards easily done in ... where did such a nice job became on the spread formation set up to pass broke to his right I just don't feel all the time it's big Mike and for a ... game first than ten from the twenty four of away heading left or right\nWe're ... [laughter] do again running behind our right side [noise]\nWould Senate Center for equal regard\nEvans tackle fake two words then and then just fall through the guard whole kept the ball of self went through the guard tackle whole broke one tackle into\nThe ... and he he's a big rocket kid he is every bit of two hundred and ten pounds he's built to run hard and he does run hard and it looks like we tend to go here and the second is away\nHas absolutely no answers to the size and he goes up and other crazy extra points lays it all we have five lineman way out to the right we have a lot to the right we have a slot to the left we're out of a shotgun now in the center is the left and and now the quarterback runs up the move\nAnd he gets in there that time huge\nThat was put Jeannie in there and that hit and I want to give credit to the other ... a player that was number for for ... a as well\nIt to the other ... a player that was number for for ... a as Well Tyler Campbell who made the hit but where is in ... for the two point conversion an adult borrow leach twenty to nothing\nFourteenth points Paul and they forty six second a period twenty to nothing at all borough tend tend to go second quarter that was eight to play thirty nine yards drive after a eleven play\nEighty one yard drive any for play sixty\nTwo yard Dr ... they're just sitting on all cylinders a diversified our fence\nAggressive defense yeah everybody just playing a very relaxed powerful game twenty nothing they've only play twelve minutes it's very impressive\nThe costs for all of our aims on the flip side it's one of those things when you're at home and you're already own for yeah it it can break your back to the season [noise]\nThey had two very close losses to start the season non league games there's that ground ball kick again Bob ... fielded by quarterback yup under a Steven Steven's on the twenty eighth he brings up to thirty seven for nine yards Steven's on the return [noise]\nNine yards and the kickoff return olive rains will start first antenna heading right to left at their own\nA that's a thirty\nSeven thirty are out on it [noise]\n\nWith again the huge defensive front at ... I mean that is one big front fans average about two Seventy\nYeah we're and Evans the defense events Purina and cue the tackles\nWho to yell and what's in it inside linebacker given striking arrest\nWho to yell and would send in and inside linebacker given striking arrest single parent back\nThat's heavily rushed by where it is picked off\nBy one said the outside lie back\nBack or on the left up to the turf by max Anderson of all of our aims an interception on a plane while well great pass rushed by we're\nWell you know he had no chance and once again you've got to eat the ball young inexperienced just screwed up and try to throw the ball out of bounds ... he was getting dragged down to the U.S through it which made these reception and it really wasn't that close to the sidelines yeah\nIt didn't get much of returning caught on about the forty three forty four they've got to take over in the middle of the field on the auto ... forty two yard line with nine fifty for the goal here in the first half that was all of our aims center and linebacker on defense Mac Sanders said and he ... he certainly did\nFirst down shotgun we're looks right where you left over a camera and Ted through a bullet had to get rid of that quick because of the outstanding pass rush for all of arranged number Ninety nine Shane Murphy used to wear number seven ... but he switched to Ninety nine for tonight's game\nSo we can play tight end up and he caught Jason by surprise and Jason had to get it over his head yup it ... unfortunately is too high for the screen man who was open\nSecond and ten ... years heading right to left\nPlus forty two yard line under center where back to pass heavily rushed throws underneath in complete coverage was by Stevens Pass rushed by Nathan abroad that was an all up less Mike yes and that's the first time we've seen the Justin dangerous to be thrown into this year from areas [noise]\nThat's Justin grandmother to my right correct [noise] here it is they would try to get the ball just an incomplete once your son who's here in sleeveless shirts\nOkay it's great to be on with the blood running thick\nOkay it's great to be on with the blood running thick so ... for those roles and flooded with a turtleneck sweater coats on is it fair to say to Justin smarter than his father [laughter]\nIce formation thirty nine and ... Cody running right\nMurphy on the rush passes knocked out of the air by debt debt dumb el Ryan of oh hey and out of nowhere three outstanding defensive plays for the tiger defense it will be forced in ten for adult borrow was the bootleg\nAnd he had makes tracking open early but he was looking deep yeah and by the time it's true to Mike you're out in the flat everybody converged because he had this little almost to a crawl himself as he approached the right side when it was\nWell I guess we're not going to see that at the end camera and wide left Daniels wide right eye formation weather for it to the full back which I like to see him play fake to Cody rolling extreme left to Cody wide open in front of a nice block from Watson cuts it inside nice bloc Cody out\nAnd he's knocked out of bounds that about the Thirteen yard line of olive arranged brilliant execution\nFake passed right screen left twenty nine yards gained Paul that's a fourth\nFor for seven right now so impressive how's that when\nIt was the exact same action is the last play yeah it starts ... who is right in the bootleg ... crows cross field back to\nThe screen on the left flat completely\nFood ... great lead block I didn't see who made it in ... ... who they were crushers so what did you give them on that twenty nine and now we're on the left passion I expect to see it tighten up the middle I like hot weather for it full backtracking cities are tied to under age back\nThey pitch to what's in writes strung out there's a little lax down that might be a hold on striking but we both thought that um\nStrung out their little lag down that might be a hold on striking but we both thought that um what is good as a Weatherford was blocking it'd be good to get ... on the line of scrimmage\nAs an effective block Iran receiver yeah I think you'd be terrific there but whatever the case may be everything's working here tonight so I'm not going to worry about that those are pretty obvious hold on a track or\n\n\n\n\nSelf cuts it up feel lowers the shoulder taken down he closed diverse down your fridge tackle made by all of our aims number eight or number nine excuse me Billy tat first down I think he picked up their senior year I don't want to be critical fans but I Can't look at the school board anymore\nBecause they're just behind the ... that's a twelve yard gained from his own thirty six to his own forty eight for Justin we're ice formation striking again the H. back on the left comes in motion right we're back\nTo pass fakes the option goes deep to the area\nCasper Twain doubled coverage\nTo the turf at the Nineteen yard line by Dan Walker dairy dairy in wall caught up beautifully executed play good luck describing that Mike Wallace it's once again it's the fake dive option and the defense of it was so confused he didn't even know that we're still at the ball where it took two steps back\n... running a what you'd call it a street pattern ideas of twenty nine year again as in Paul uh yes exactly right it was negative forty eight to the plus Nineteen [noise]\nAnd here this time they what's speed sweep again in the speech we\nTo Cameron [noise]\nIt has just isn't working for the cameras are going to go quickly coach showed up at the right\nTo run a counter to do any of that but let's let's give up in this speech was the first time that ran that camera and gained about five the next two times they've run that Cameron dramas eighties teeth well [noise] so it is second in fifty fourteen ... he's now he's inside\nOld Cody inside but bounces it outside gets a great blackout they're still going to know that the walk in the back they're going to call by weather for this ... take it out about three hours after a tough one [noise]\nYep [noise] I thought original\nWe are going after a tougher on [noise]\nYep I thought originally it was a great blocked by Weatherford but if they felt they got 'em and I was totally stopped\nInside and\nCody couldn't be a hundred and sixty pounds\nAnd he's so light footage and he promised that outside and they made a couple of very good moves\nAnd sometimes when you're making moves like the defenders have to do a complete pivots yeah and the weather's been kinda nice block right in the middle of the spine uh that's illegal and so it's going to be a ten yards heavily from the south was Weatherford block in the back [noise] yup yes\nOnce again because of the great move Cody made he had no idea I made that grew moved to the ball comes back now to the twenty six yard line after the penalty so we had a second and Fifteen and now after the penalty we have a second and Fifteen\nWhich means he must have gained five yards on that plane got to give them a five yard game\nArithmetic and [noise] it says first and Fifteen but it is the second yeah\nWe're runs left huge blocking on that side of the center Woodson goody all the guard cute to tackle\nAnd a nice ... y Weatherford you know and there's a time out called the Arab world one oh nine to go in the ... leads twenty nothing\nSpeaking fans one of the reasons I'm decent that that is the guy who has the ... down a marker which is on the line of scrimmage yeah\nGenerally doesn't move right until the lines in sickness and his father or for forty years ran a crew on the sidelines it would have fired the guy momentarily nobody got probation\nSo he leaves yeah so it's a positive and see how many are Jews who had because I'm I'm from the school boy I never have it right so they ...\nSee how many are Jews who had because there are up on the scoreboard you never have it right\nSo they started out the plus twenty six now with the plus for teens who was a twelve year again who are the Kerry\nAnd that was once again a quarterback drop by where right\nFollowing my extracting the full back effect I'm off guard ... distract wipes out the linebacker the left side of the line just blew everybody back off the ball and\nThen where a rumble forward and uh so it's now they've got the wrong down at the second down it's really third down insect exactly apparently the staff has noticed and I was going to tell them\nJustin I mean a camera and lost four on first down you're not going down was the big game guy Cody called back so it was only five yard game plus a penalty that gave me a second down again we're again twelve and now it's third insects not ... oh in the backfield is Cody and ... down first hit is made by\nAnd I don't have a number two on my program a second hit\nWhile he lost you mean by ... and that was the count and draw and you're in it right into the teeth to the seven men blitz\nAnd to the twenty so yeah and that that was really cat who had the initial head yes and uh\nWith five fifty nine seconds to go here and a half in\nOnce again this should be fourth down but it's listed his third down while it\nHas any they the coaches for all the way or the fans no one's even notice that it says third down or they should be fourth\nOne I remember the year Colorado won a national championship ... and he wouldn't die scored a touchdown against Missouri on fifth down and give it back which was interesting\nWhich was interesting 'cause our grandfather when he was the coach of Colorado against the same team in the same thing happened then he gave the touchdown back and lost the game ... yes he gave it back and watch the game and so\nLittle bit different sportsmanship the latter part of the house\nI ... and lost the game and so\nLittle bit different sportsmanship and the latter part of the ... century and the twenty first I don't know where the sportsmanship skull and of course we did a game and the indoor ... indoor football league down in Maryland where it happened\nOn third time which should be fourth we're back to pass goes over whether for its head nice defensive covers ran over Seventy one for Jeanie\nAnd so now it will be fits down for adult borrow but who's counting wow besides us I mean\nI'm going to write it down on my stats fifth and twelve ... twelve this is something unusual\nFifty three and a half seconds to go\nWe tend to play the drive [noise] wow\nWell when you interview extracting the staff last week yeah Tony the officer coordinator you might want to run this ...\nYou know Michael using his voice comes on and he would have ... you know yes the ref as our grandfather did all those years ago with the head coach at Colorado that's a passe today Myron Ellis with um second winningest coach of the history of University of Colorado football forced to resign in Nineteen thirty one because he refused to compromise academic standards\nTo recruit athletes who are the two I think all of a how to resolve screwed up if they had to rent a motion at the same time they called time out before the officials could throw a flag\n[laughter] exactly the truth [noise]\nAnd so we'll play one quick commercial and then come back with a fifth actually will keep it right here because it's twenty second time\nTo those longtime football fans this is a rare exception for you you get to enjoy a sit down play [noise]\nIt was twins to the ride this out to the left in the splits the right and the ice formation and\nI think we're going to have a blitz\nAnd the split to the right and the ice formation and\nI think we're going to have a blitz coming up in the middle\nFifth and twelve play action double a gap blitz we're throws\nPasses intercepted when he should have knocked it down and he tackled in the end zone and there's a flag in the backfield [noise]\nAnd it might be roughing to pass or our number forty two which is to mail Ryan\nInterception was made by Stevens Boise play the game boy that was a suburban inception\nWell you know what that's justice ... got an extra doubted on fifth down they throw their reception is not that I'm a religious sort [laughter] yes but [noise]\nAnd I I in the in the end zone or you know it was a boat ride so anyway um where it's still five for ten now for a hundred and thirty nine yards here in the first half who's that's true too is that the camera and yes it was overthrown\nThroat underperforming choose me up just by about six inches and it's all it took the Stevens to make a nice sleeping and deception should've knocked down yep Stevens a hell of a player\nAnd now they have that wild cat formation again this is ... running left huge power formation bursting throughout our borough tackle urged theory and finally slows them down and cue helps bring them down along with striking he goes from his own twenty to his own forte too\nKnow that's the best play they have\nTwenty to nothing Adel borrow thirty three point eight seconds to go and a half time out all of arrange we'll be right back after this W.
