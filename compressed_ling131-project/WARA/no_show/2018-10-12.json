ridiculous indeed I should be interested to know why\nIs that sort of thing with possible a past history would be full of time travelers besides going into the past could change the president and produce all sorts of paradoxes\nThose are good points though not perhaps as original as you suppose about the enemy refute the possibility of time travel\nSince the original as you suppose about the

wait for a reply\nConsumed by curiosity Ashton followed\nThey walk in silence until I was standing among the frozen traffic of talking unquote road for a while she stood staring at the busy yet motionless crowds and then she side\nI cannot help feeling sorry for them and for you I Wonder what you would have made of yourselves\nWhat do you mean by that\nJust no Mr Ashton you imply that the

ship dexterity and one of the other side and I'll just like comparing [noise] and then we'll streams found was when I heard over his radio [noise] immediately let me began to cold agenda Mitch\nBut they didn't hear him then that's something like near panic to close the lending [noise]\nTown stopped\nAnd Jeff hurting the three men then return to the ship's captain\nWhat's happening to image with things happening to him I told you he's unstable psychological misspent I mean I'm not going to bring that up again it let me says he heard a strange noise he heard it and then why did not hear it why didn't you duck duck was not side how could he\nHe was listening to us from the on the ships receiving that are now personal radios all work on identical frequencies\nIt'd be interesting to hear at least one of us would have had that must have imagined it would be careful what you implying Mitch what other explanation is there anything could happen out here anything radios could play tricks ships lemons anybody's maybe there's some kind of radio waves we know nothing about the can only be out here in space\nA peaceful for now break it up you two lemons upset enough without you discussing like he was a mental case\nTrouble with the ship is rooms are limited you can hardly keep you don't see as of next time I'll be able to separate Kevin terrorists second in first class no need to be flippant Mitch what do you think about this duck huh I don't know what to think at first I was inclined to agree with Mitch say lemonade the imagining things\n... who could blame a man's without out here\nBut [laughter] ... not that type besides he says the song was the same as we all her just before we contact base remembering atmospheric awesome this equipment it wasn't the atmospherics Mitch that radio picked up something no doubt about that I mean it might have been transmitted could have been he'll be saying\nRadio picked up something no doubt about that I mean it might have been transmitted could have been he'll be saying it came from the moon next and why not there's no life from them or how do you know if you've been there for heaven's sake jak what's got into you\nAny elementary textbook on a strong I'm able to prove there's no life I remember what it also tell you what lines on the other side of the moon but of course not and I managed to have seen it\n[laughter] gonna be any different from the side\nIt must be much the same image you can't prove it Mitch and you can't explain the behavior to the radio being out of action for so long in picking up those weird sounds just before control came through YouTube trying to say that this life civilizations maybe on other planets we're not saying there is all there is that you can't rule out the possibility I can\nI Believe it when I if I see it until then I'll be guided by the fact that life on any kind of other than earth is most I'm like why should the earth's\nBe singled out why should such a and senators and when he's small part of the universe be unique for the same reason that you are you in the ... it's only about you is that lucky combination of circumstances now I can agree with you agree or not is beside the point that the question in hand at the moment is Lenny can you\nFirst start when you have to make it really doesn't go outside the ship again or there'll be no need for anyone to go outside again the chances of another major hitting his or a million to want to get him I didn't mean while we still casting I mean from now on\nEven often we've touched down on the moon you you mean you'd let him go all that way and then ... them to step outside and that's not going to be one hundred percent sure we might get a repeat performance of what happened half an hour I won't do it too neither will lie\nI tell you let me see I'm a stable arguments\nMiddle Mitch you'll being unreasonable malls an unreasonable I just want to be sure that nothing rex this project that's more important than anything or anyone isn't it all done right it is thought image but let me cut his on his was arranged what happened outside is going to make no difference alright I consider myself I've

area\nAre right now breathing size of relief after all land court judge ruled out that company\nCannot bills that ... plant on their property\nNow that matter has dragged on and court since twenty fourteen but a decision that made\nPublic yesterday the judge found that that actual plant is not allowed\nIn industrial business park where most of the Alabama Senate gravel is located for many many years well of course as I mentioned that company does occupied about a hundred and eighty six acres in that area and has operated that Cory for years well the company basically hope to add another Ashville plant to that site but\nActually was opposed by some residents and the city forcing that issue into court about four years ago in fact a small part of that property just off Tiffany is located as you know in a residential zone one resident of that area is actually in opposition in fact she said\nIt's really been a ... a relief right now a lot of people put a lot of work into opposing this\nAnd of course it finally did pay off so uh this of course will be not going away\nVery quickly that's for sure but\nThey did say that it was a victory for the whole city a call or two in for the company was taken by the assistant who said\nThat person was not in the office yesterday but they did say they are not available for comment one person also who is a commented on that project for the plant did not return also a call yesterday\nA male Paul hello was actually pleased by the outcome he said that he was very happy to the court ruled in favor the city's director of planning and development Gary or Asian said his office\nThe court ruled in favor of the city is director of planning and development Gary or Asians had his office had been at the center of this dispute\nWhich of course focused on the meaning of Henry manufacturing which is actually not allowed in some of the zones Gary also said he and his staff actually worked very hard on the case and right now are very happy with the result\nRight now a lawyer for the city also says Alvaro sand and gravel does have thirty days to file an appeal if that's what the company\nBasically decides to do

the ad council [noise]\nAll right we've got some rain out there this morning at fifty nine degrees had just went down just a a one notch out there when the last few moments six forty two now and of course we do have some more of your updates on the forecast right now meteorologist Jim Gordon standing by once again Jim\nWell dawn we are right on the northern flank of the storm Michael now extra tropical\nJust two days ago it was still in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and here it is off to ourselves right now again the heaviest rains will be the further south you go to places like tempered in Providence and a Fall River over towards ah say Westport those will get the heaviest rains at least in the immediate area\nRiver over towards ah say Westport those will get the heaviest rains at least in the immediate area lesser of miles to the north in fact there'll be almost no rain this morning and she got up towards the mass pipe and Boston Boston just barely on the edge of the rain so if you drive out of the Arab world so you would leave route Ninety five right now go up north through wall polio drive out of the rain\nOr just around where I thought one twenty eight now there is still a little bit there but bottom line is a wet but not too windy morning a drier but Wendy or afternoon so there's the trade off today\nTemperatures going up just a few degrees into the low sixties and then as I said yesterday they'll start to fall off mid to late afternoon back into the fifties so you really notice the reeds picking up Fifteen to thirty miles an hour if you got to thirty five we haven't seen the day like this since last spring\nAnd certainly as we get into the cool season will see many more of them again a day where there'll be several hours\nAll but rather gusty winds again not stormy wins but ... you're not then tonight breezy\nMostly clear in the evening and by the way the crescent moon will start can be visible again over the next two nights are assuming it's clear and it will be deceived you know however there'll be some clouds after midnight but as we've been talking about is that John just mentioned earlier about the football games tonight uh this evening a it's still a bit of a breeze not as crazy as today but\nI'd say still about Fifteen miles an hour times out of the northwest a west temperatures will be falling\nQuickly so a cool evening if you're going to be heading out but really this is almost average or as it's been so above average then tomorrow a couple of mourning showers again not a I wouldn't call it a low impact but I've sort of a moderate impact for a time if you're going to be out dodging the few showers and then southern clouds not a bad afternoon tomorrow but quite cool highs and the low fifties\nThen as we go into tomorrow night mostly clear as wins diminish yeah it looks like the coldest temperature of the season so far by two or three degrees we had a couple of mornings you might remember last week or two weeks ago a down into the low forties will upper thirties by Sunday Morning and then a nice recovery with\nGo down to the low forties will upper thirties by Sunday Morning and then a nice recovery with lots of sunshine at least all day in terms of the son of course we have the shorter days now but\nUh what they like there is on Sunday we'll feature sunshine almost the entire day highs in the mid to upper fifty so better recovery in the afternoon after a cold start\nAnd then falling back to about fifty Sunday night\nCourse again we have these games going on with the red Sox both Saturday and Sunday night the patriots Sunday night whether should cooperate although uh all eyes will be on a\nDavid Price Sunday evening remember he had earlier in the season he had trouble gripping the ball he had ... fingers you might remember that well it's going to be ... temperatures on Sunday evening not cold but in the upper forties I'm thinking so we'll see how that goes my goodness then a Sunday after we cool off at night\nMonday we'd have sunshine to start clouds in the afternoon to ... hours a night\nAnd then a cool air masses coming back for Tuesday itself sun and clouds eyes in the fifties so you've got the idea this is it now for the warm temperatures for a while on Wednesday\nTemperatures in the low fifties low in the fifties and potentially a some wind chill talk by the middle of the latter part of next week now not like the middle of winter obviously but Don we may be talking wind chills by mid to late with\nAll boy here we go as we get into a lot of ... or the middle and latter part of October here we go and are getting your favorite moment\nNow yeah we have not done we want to talk about by that of course a we'll have other issues going on like a setting the clocks back on the election and everything else I'll be very quick to 'em and I know I Want to cut into the all the great music what issue I've asked you this before what what'd you say is the first\nRock and roll song that was considered rock and roll whether it was a good or bad song or maybe the first one or two songs that were like okay this is a rock and roll song what what is what is known as the first like you know this is the first just go\nI can roll song what what is what is known as the first like you know this is the first disco song by what's her name the blonde the allegedly or whatever but what would you say is the first real considered rock and roll song from like the\nUm mother very first rock and roll song or was probably considered well considering a bill Haley and the comments Nineteen fifty five but you know right around the clock but I Will say\nGoing back to Nineteen fifty three uh that's all right mama by Elvis Presley was actually most considered that because that was two years prior\nOh wow oh have you played that one such interesting Nineteen fifty three\nWas his very first song that he did a as a single a about a about six seven months prior to that he did do a song for his mother which really wasn't a single for him but that but that's all right momma was for a single now\nNow you just said blonde the blonde the I'd ever Harry and blind date that was a that was not the first disco song that was actually more of the ... song was Nineteen Seventy nine into Nineteen eighty that was actually I the first song out of the disco era I Would say the very first disco song\nI'm back in Seventy three Seventy four [noise]\nUm I Will say a rock the boat by the huge corporation was probably number one number two a fly Robin fly or by the silver convention Nineteen Seventy three that was considered the very first disco song because that's where\nMore of a difficult line dance or came out of in fact when you hear that song back in the early to mid seventies or the this this um the dance a craze uh called the bump was actually made for that song that the silver convention did and of course ah somebody else on the right after that and of course\nUh the Bee Gees didn't really start going into it until it's\nBill's on the right after that and of course uh\nThe Bee Gees didn't really start going into it until about a couple of years later you think you know they say oh the beaches were\nTop of the charge yeah bee Jay's where I kind of a competing with Casey in the sunshine man and a a you know you'd be Jesus cost an Australian rock group basically got that disco feel\nIn Nineteen Seventy six when Saturday Night fever came out a year later as they had already done that those songs which of course was for the movie they started filming at an early Seventy six anyways Casey in the sunshine being however\nUh they started in middle of Seventy four and got their biggest hits between then and I'm about Seventy six Seventy seven\nSo they're all competes you think the Saturday Night fever you know a movie it would have helped just go\nOh I think so a hundred percent yes it definitely uh it definitely did you know the funny thing is\nSpeaking of it and I saw I saw a documentary on Saturday Night live on a Saturday Night fever and Greece or both featured of course John Travolta the funny thing is Saturday Night fever of course was was films ... first of course in the early seventies sex\nAnd of course in the movie it was a great song to do it because of the time they did this role in that movie a to a\nSong

um it's basically out of our control right now we're going to try to see if we can rectify that\nToday may not rectify today maybe tomorrow whenever it is but we're not really sure what it is but we'll try to figure out what's going on out there on the on the airwaves as well\nI right now we do have our final check in this a portion of the morning meteorologist Jim Corman standing by with another update for something for cash him\nWell dumb the extra tropical storm Michael now at its closest approach to the elbow Providence area about two hundred miles and we're getting the northwest edge of it right now\nBut it's starting to pay them back to the south East that bodes well\nFor an end to the rain or on average within the next hour or two and then just cloudy and then increasing wind and then eventually son so that's why I kind of a changing day today\nWins this afternoon especially through about say three o'clock or so it could be just enough to thirty five miles an hour long around some of the leaves so you want to be careful of the leaves fall they could be wet because we talk about this this time of year when the leaves fall off and it's wet can be slippery just walking around or even\nThere have been traffic accidents dude a wet leaves so be careful of that this afternoon now will dry out just in time certainly uh for the football games the same thing again I'm I'm expecting an average temperature above the fifty five at around seven o'clock but a breeze and then cooling to about fifty one by nine o'clock forty four forty three forty four by morning\nAnd then we'll have a few showers in the morning tomorrow it's an upper level features oh it won't last too long but certainly if it's gonna rain tomorrow it's in the morning with a few again mostly light showers and then suddenly clouds in the afternoon the big story tomorrow the coolest daytime of the season so far low fifties that's it I think about\nLow fifties that's it I think about the low eighties we had just the other day low fifties tomorrow but again not a bad afternoon a little bit of a breeze and then on Sunday I started out in the upper thirties coldest morning of the season so

by clouds Monday showers at night and then we start to get cooler again for Tuesday\nA reinforcing shot of chill by Wednesday night and Thursday of next week they start talking wind chills with a baby some windshield that could approach the thirties at some point the middle of next week so if you if enjoy the\nRather warm conditions for mid October or even early to mid October all over the last

on the line\nYeah and again John once the sun comes out of the big story really not that it's a major story but that when really picking up a seeing gusts up to thirty miles an hour and not not fire to the west of here so what it is is the storm Michael pulling away and the high pressure rushing in\nTo it center and that's why we're going to have several hours of gusty winds again not storm for for us but that really is going to be the issue for several hours and you'll really noticed it beginning within the next hour or two that when picking up as the rain moves away then I'll talk to you

U. changed that used to say ... ... s DL stood for some long word I couldn't pronounce\nSovereign demanding liberty there it is well it wasn't that at all it was silver dollars limited very hard so we're\nThirty five year old company we buy and sell American money yeah go and they're talking about Federal Reserve money\nYes there's a difference yes you sell your point edge yeah yeah ... what Andrew Jackson would call money yes you know I usually\nIt killed the ... the second generation of the Federal Reserve that was his platform if you vote for me I Will kill this bank because what what Americans don't realize is we have the power to issue our money\nTo a group of private banks and they've been using it to our detriment and to their benefit every strategy up\nAnd then lastly about your background Andrew is the author of the secret world of money on it and Uncle Sam cooks the books um two outstanding books now\nUm our our remote producer of this program Mike Roberts book this interview based on a New York times article that I read and I swear to God of Andrew when I read this article I thought of you\n[laughter] good yes seriously I thought oh ... it's not going to like this um [noise] but uh as the national debt rises the government is predicted to spend more on interest on the national debt\nThan on the military that was a column in the er an article excuse me the uh September twenty six New York times and we are now on the actual\nOf September twenty six New York times and we are now on schedule\nTo spend more on interest payments on the national debt than we are on Medicaid so we're spending more on financing our debt than we are on taking camera people providing health care for people pretty big role for the government how in heaven's name did this happen Andrew\nHow because well every ... every president I don't want to pile based on President Obama's many Republicans like to do but every single president since Ronald Reagan ... has doubled the national debt during their term so they all Dick\nCheney line or deficits don't matter came to be accepted policy in Washington DC\nSays it says if we have a credit card company that allows us to raise our own credit limit and to never really paid principles to only pay interest and do if we don't have the money to pay the interest we can borrow that too\nAnd and this is where we are with our finances it's disgusting place to be\nAnyone who find themselves in a death spiral you get your credit card bills every month you make the minimum payments and then the next month you're in the same spot that you were maybe a little deeper and so it doesn't matter that you're making your payments every month to you're not reducing your principal and we\nAs a nation have not reduced our principal ever it just keeps getting bigger every year so and I you know as much as I like President Trump's policies he's still spending a trillion dollars more than he's taken in every year so\nTime to put a stop to that sort of thing yeah what was I think senators aren't as Hollande says if you're the best way to\nGet where you're in a hole stop digging I guess that's the best way yes we should stop\nSpeaking of presidents who mistreated women um didn't didn't we\nSpeaking of presidents who mistreated women um didn't didn't we didn't we do a little bit better under Bill Clinton didn't cut into the deficit well are you going to correct me again [laughter]\nYeah Bill Clinton was a liar you know I hate to say but when you take all the money from the Social Security trust fund and then say that you have no deficit you know I was there when he came out and put that big zero on the board like we're all idiots\nHe had taken all of the Social Security trust fund where we all the Social Security three trillion dollars he says his Bill Clinton and others like him a and I my favorite quote are mad at senator or his columns and he said and I quoted him an Uncle Sam cooks the book\nShe said that the best way to stop or to save Social Security is to stop looting it and that unfortunately is Bill Clinton's legacy which is not so bad that he took the money but then to try to convince us that somehow he\nHad balance the budget that's again ally and let's just tell like\nIt is visitors and I'll tell you if there's anything I have to say the president's favorite is that he tells it like it is good bad indifferent I'd rather have a straight then to try to you know pee on my leg and tell me it's raining\nOh there it is that was the name of judge Judy's Book I read years ago her father used to say that the current opium my leg and tell me it's raining um you know you have any questions for indie ... still there yeah\nOkay good or for a ... one of America's foremost experts on the amount on American monetary\nA system the author of the secret world of money and Uncle Sam cooks the book's text them to me it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for I think you recall and do we give our we call our time\nTo eight seven six one nine for I think you recall and do we give our\nWe call our textures remote correspondence 'cause that sounds more impressive and we give them agent numbers because we love the show get smart agent to twenty four writes in do you think the national debt can ever be paid off it seems impossible to me\nNo not at all I in fact see if we take over the Federal Reserve and put them into the treasury where they belong and stop pretending they're\nThey should be independent then we can keep the the early ... right now they\nGive us a you know a peanut or from their earnings but in reality you have six figure vice presidents bullet proof limos forty seven Lear jets these guys live it up\nAnd it all comes off the top I'd just like to send Senator Bernie Sanders in there to look at their books but the fed has never been audited ever ever\nAnd they've been running our monetary system for a hundred and five years and not once have we ever gotten a look at the books so\nIf we can either audit to federal nationalize the fed would be my socialist view okay nationalize the fed and let's take the profits from that enormous moneymaking amphibians devote them to paying down the national debt\nIs is that you see to make things work we have to blend um elements of capitalism and socialism to make everything work all socialization and the answer and all capitalism isn't the answer\nThat but when it when it comes to a national resource faith you know people want to compare okay a private company makes the product and brings it to market and sell that okay that's that's fine let them keep their money but when you're going to take a national resource like the ability to create money or\nThe oil underneath federal lands or the\nOf course like the ability to create money or the oil underneath federal lands or the trees in federal forest you better give us a uh the people we the people of substantial cut of what you're doing and we were absolutely get robbed by the Federal Reserve every year\nOkay I'm not to channel my inner Alex Jones 'cause I I don't think much of the man but I can I ask you before we take our our our break or ten forty five break at ten forty eight can I ask you one way wicked conspiratorial question go forth\nUsually or really any gold left in Fort Knox or not\nYes yes there is there's gold in Fort Knox but\nIts pledge as an asset against our Federal Reserve note issue so we have like thirty trillion dollars in Federal Reserve notes\nAnd two hundred and five million ounces of go if you divide it was to against each other you got to go all the sounds something ridiculous like fifty three thousand dollars are now so it's meaningless what was a little bit we have\nIn Fort Knox as meaning but I've heard the rumors that it's been emptied and so forth\nUm yeah you'd have to really put on your extra heavy duty rebels temp for a hat\nYou a hundred and five at All right actually we're going to take a break can be back with Andy gods in less than two minutes we have two more questions ... correspondence that have

Henrietta Lacks is cells are to the contribution of science contribution she did not know she was making at the time\nYeah I mean there isn't a person out there who hasn't benefitted in numerous ways from the cells um you know at the vaccines that we all\nGet were developed using her cells they were the first genes with some of the first ever sequenced um they went up in the space to see it would happen to human cells in zero gravity in vitro fertilization was developed with the help of her cells I mean just the list goes on and on and on it's just I'm kind of income\nWhile it about Henrietta Lacks Henrietta Lacks' cells the heel of line what is it about her shows I mean she had cervical cancer\n[noise] yeah\nAre her ... her cancer cells and if she had an incredibly aggressive cancer that grew out of unlike in many cancers it went from a tiny tumor on her cervix to just within a few months or just tumors covering every oriented or ...\nTiny tumor on her cervix to just within a few months or just tumors covering every oriented her body um and part of what ... is amazing by herself in that they were first um but also they grow with this intensity that really wasn't ever seen in the labs and kind of hasn't been seen seen since\nAnd so what did Johns Hopkins do how did they realize this and then how did they start how did they take the cells and what happened to them [noise]\nYeah so they didn't realize anything I mean she just happened to walk into Hopkins in the fifties at a time when scientists all around the world we're trying to grow human cells outside the body and it had never worked and\nSo at Hawkins there was one of the leading tissue culture researchers who was kind of at the head of the field and he was taking samples from anyone he could get his hands on any patients who walked into the hospital himself his kids as friends\nAnd basically it was just trying to grow any self he could and so it really was this kind of chance confluence of events that Henrietta was this incredible cancer arrived at the location where this man had been trying to do this for so long\nSo it wasn't that they targeted her that they said oh her cells are interesting she just went in for a routine by a biopsy of her tumor and they just took an extra little piece and put that in a dish\n'em and that's what became the cell line and and that she never knew about\nBut they did and they knew how valuable it was so they didn't tell her she died and they didn't tell her family is that right in fact they understood that they wanted information from her family as well um they're ...\nAs well actually they didn't yeah they didn't know these were going to be valuable so at the time we didn't know anything about cells they were just trying to cure cancer there like if we can grow cancer cells outside the body maybe we can figure out why it's so powerful\nThey had no concept there was no industry connected to any of this or biology really in general they hadn't DNA hadn't been discovered yet so we couldn't know that somebody\nWould you really in general they have DNA hadn't been discovered yet so we couldn't know that some day they'd be able to look in these cells and learn about her family so it's important to look at this story within the context of history in that way that they they really had no idea what they were potentially discovering\nI'm more of that there was a potentially any gain in it and they didn't and they didn't have any sense that they wanted anything from her family until twenty five years later in the seventies\nOh worse can't hold no words can describe how proud I Am proud I Am of my grandmother may just knowing her story and what she had done not just for a certain group or\nA a a um\nShe just didn't so much for the world and I'm just so proud that I had the chance while I'm getting the chance to know my grandmother to know her contributions and to actually go out and advocate\nWe're gonna have we're leaving their Jerry ... thank you so much and we'll continue part too with Rebecca Skloot safe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks I mean you get [noise]\nContinue part too with Rebecca Skloot said Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks I get\nThis week on devil is yes catch letters home to ... the Bush family genealogy and civil war letters\nTaken from letters and documents from the late Eighteen hundreds this presentation tells them out of a resident David list is great grandfather Francis and buy a bliss who served in the union calorie during the civil war you can watch this program and all of our quality programs around the area in high definition on double A.

middle\nSo I I have some news that I wanted to talk about from this week uh did you hear the story about Taylor Swift\nNow happening this week well supposedly she posted on Instagram that she's not going to vote for the Republican candidate even though she is a woman because that woman and supports\nA darn her record Apollo than terrifies her she said yeah so basically she doesn't protect women against domestic violence or date rape and I'm going to use that businesses have the right to refuse services to gay people and then they should not have the right to marry [noise]\nAnd actually vote for the Democrat male you know it she would rather vote for a female you know in office but\nThe thing is with with the um what's the endgame here because male or female or anywhere between\nWhat do you believe in do you believe in social justice or being pro corporation pro capitalism pro not saying that we're socialist but [noise] you know when you put the um and you believe that the good of the few outweigh the good of the many you know that's that can't be healthy\nActually she also talked about the importance of registering in voting nationally this mid term\nAnd speaking of that October seventeenth is the deadline to register to vote so if you haven't registered to vote you need to get out there and do that because November six is the mid term elections and into very important time to vote right now so\nThis is the mid term elections and they're very important time to vote right now so we absolutely have to do that so [noise] also do you know yesterday was yes it was Thursday the about ... yes it was national coming out day oh that's right I I almost ...\nAnd I went to camp for a week oh yeah yeah oh it's great what kind of get with it it was like a um food in fun can really yeah great that sounds great sounds like you're\nDoing all kinds of things just like other kids your age in school sounds great and I think that's a wonderful and you should be able to do the same things as other people and had the same rights and that's what we're talking about today is about um question three and what we're uh\nWe're we're going to be voting on in November and you know I Want to ask you some things about your identity and I hope they're not too uncomfortable for you but um\nAbout your identity and I hope they're not too uncomfortable for you but um what um can you tell me what you identify as\nI say as a female um\n\nI'd say is transgender female\nOkay and when did you know that you identify that the girl\nI'm I kind of knew like um when I was four four\nOkay and uh what did you uh how did you know that did you start doing things differently did you start\nI just felt like I wasn't in the race body like I Would say I have the heart and mind girls with the body of a boy mhm\nMhm what was that was pretty uncomfortable I bet yeah yeah hard for you to to do things and do you feel now that you're living the way that you should be living yes yeah\nGreat that's great that's wonderful I Want to add\nTo that when I look at her and we look at Raila I she's pure girl I'm I'm saying or there's no way there's no way that I Would guess that she would have been born male mhm I'm\nThis is why this ballot question is how important folks because [noise]\nWhen nature calls or she wants to go into any place where it's at a park ... state park or [noise] and they um [noise]\nLike off the highway to like a rest rest area yeah things like that you want to get Coca Cola guess now go to the ladies' room just like any other girl yeah you know\nYou feel comfortable and like going to the ladies' room is that correct\nYeah you know do you feel comfortable and like going to the ladies' room is that comfortable for you I Do yeah you have you ever seen anybody look at you weird or\nAre they anything that her well it's good it's great I mean it it glad that you haven't had to deal with that at all do you understand what the question is all about yeah on on ballot yeah\nYeah it's basically um I was going to go through that a little bit just to kind of read what the the question was and just to to let everybody know again I Know we already did talk about it and it basically the law I'm into that said sixteen was that it added gender identity to the list of prohibited\nGrounds for discrimination in places a public ... a combination resort or amusement such grounds include race color religious create national origin disability and ancestry so they're just adding\nGender identity to that law and ah with with everything else so you can't discriminate against those uh types of things\nAnd you just can't discriminate against gender identity which seems kind of dumb not to have it on there [noise]\nAnd unfortunately it's just about some people who decided that they want it to repeal it because they thought so we're going to abuse it\nYou know and if they do then they're going to do it anyway you know it's not about um the transgender people doing it yeah\nThat's the sound off another example of someone just put my head of what happens when I'm On us people get punished for one person's sin Mm um how often folks have\nSince ... um how often folks have\nYou flown for someone special\nAnd that person closest their heart off for you or doesn't believe your love for them because they were hurt by previous individual you know if\nIt's not your fault that you should be admonished and shut out because that other person you're falling for was hurt by yet another person in the past\nYou know the sort of everybody's fault just for somebody else right now to talk of pain you know it against if they won rotten apple in the borough let me just find that apple and carve out the rod and pardon eat the rest I guess [laughter] and we can take it out yeah\n[noise] well I'm Marcia I actually have a couple of questions for you to if you don't mind answering um do you feel the school um has been supportive of Raiola and your family and her identity and everything\nAbsolutely um the school has been\nMore than accommodating supportive from the very beginning it was a road that I wasn't familiar with and I'm at the time when she transitioned we were at will it elementary school\nAnd it was something that they had never um had to um to deal with\n... and and so we did it together and um we learned we made some mistakes along the way and we corrected them as a team we worked together and it was fantastic and now in middle school it's just it's even better\nIt's great it's great that they're more willing to be\nJust it's even better\nIt's great it's great that they're more willing to be supportive and to [noise]\nTo allow for this all to happen it in a kind of you know calm way and not be I'm so horrific right yeah yeah it's been great it's great have you felt any um discrimination of any kind just in any place in Massachusetts or in the city\nWe haven't um we've been very fortunate\nUm to not to not have that um\nTo look at ... with long hair and the way that she dresses and her features as a twelve year old I mean she she identifies as a female and she looks like a female right so we've been fortunate\nRight right right that's good and I ... as we were talking about last week with when Jason was here uh\nHe also um looks his identity you know so he passes as a boy and you know just as right law passes as a girl so that's great that's great and I I'm I'm so glad that it's worked out for you guys\nUh we have to go to another quick break and we'll come back and talk more thinking

the minority\nAnd if my daughter had to walk into a boy's room because she's a transgender girl\nI fear for her safety in the boys' room than I Do for the other females and the girls around with my daughter in there\nMhm right and and that's actually what Jason last week were saying to you know because he looks like a male if this were to be repealed then he technically would have to go in the girl's room and that would make it harder for everybody everybody\nThe girls wouldn't want him and the girl's room ... you know because he doesn't look like or not logical folks\nRight right I mean
