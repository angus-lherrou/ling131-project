going to complain right it's the cold front and stuff when it's thirty eight degrees that's the bad right\nNow if you go into a friday it looks like any early showers and very early they would be followed by increasing sunshine\nFor a friday it looks like any early showers and very early they would be followed by increasing sunshine and the temperatures reaching the ... sixties uh friday one of those days where it doesn't go up much but uh the tradeoff is increasing sunshine so that's the good news right now I expect\nSunshine with Bill O'Reilly clouds and cool temperatures but really not that bad mid fifties on Saturday\nAnd then right now it looks like another one of these cold is so far mornings on Sunday potential upper thirties and a few places no frost though with no freeze but upper thirties and low forties Sunday Morning and then a nice recovery too about sixty on Sunday afternoon now of course\nWe've heard Donald courses mentioned the red Sox winning last night\nThere are games this weekend at Fenway Park will be in the evening of course a too late for many kids to watch but at any rate ... Saturday and Sunday evening the weather should be nice and comfortable cool\nWet dry the big story is going to be and they're already arguing about this um the patriots are playing at the same time as the red Sox Sunday evening there at Sunday Night Football and then of course they both in home\nNow Gillette in Fenway Park so there's a big argument why\nA major league baseball does not\nPlay the game in the afternoon\nOr because of the two teams are going into Houston and the red Sox Boston so you're going to hear about that over the next couple of days why don't they changed the time of the game or they don't have to have it at night but a cause it's usually because of money situations the tropics Hubble is done we have three names storms in the tropics we have\nA still can you believe Leslie\nLeslie has been around for eternity but as I've been having fun with it lovely Leslie has not bother anyone it continues to just turn up the seas out over the Atlantic it's going to make a close passed back towards the AIDS or Z\nAnd also the book of all places the Canary Islands out there now again or it's not bothering anyone on land but it just has continued to a rattle the seas with ...\nNow again or it's not bothering anyone on land but it just has continued to a rattle the seas with many days for ship so they've been just avoiding allegedly\nA we also have nay dean yeah it did form yesterday come off to Africa but this late in the season for anything out there to make this fire across at least for now so they gain is going to be another one that might be somewhat like Leslie not bothering anyone anytime soon cause what is bothering is now a major hurricane or Michael\nAgain it's a straight named Michael there's no ... Mickey Mouse Kayla they finally have a nice normal name Michael wins the hundred and forty five miles an hour uh again it's going over the very warm but shallow\nA Gulf of Mexico they're off the panhandle unfortunately a it's a bad case scenario for a storm surge there it's moving right and now the difference between Florence and\nMichael is that Florence was barely moving and it was a big rain maker was bad at the coast\nBut the storm slightly weak and this one will not we can much as it hits the coast so a major storm surge situation if there are going to be bad situation from from that it would be that people do not leave their house or even if they're near the ocean and a waves battle of the house and they end up\nWell bad things happen in the beginning of the the well it's called drowning\nThat's why people should get the heck out of their most of them are now eventually this storm is going to move back over inland areas of Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina places that did get hit by Florence three weeks ago and they still are under some floods and they're going to get about three to six inches of rain because it's moving along so fast\nThe rain won't be the major issue with this but the places that had ... the other day a few weeks ago are still underwater so you'll be hearing more about that tomorrow at that tracks inland the storm will track as an extra tropical storm south of us friday morning\nInland the storm will track as an extra tropical storm south of us friday morning that's the closest approach and if you know anyone perhaps on Nantucket Island they could get battered by fifty sixty miles an hour winds early friday morning\nBefore the storm moves out now as it does so there'll be a strong pressure gradient and that's why I've been thinking about very breezy weather I set a friday afternoon but drier\nOut of the north west of the football games on friday evening although it should be okay and I'm ... I was talking about the football games to high school or it should be okay but it will be a little on the windy side so that might be an issue with some of the some of the games at that time Saddam again a lot to go through but overall compared to everything else that's happening\nA weather wise or including they've had more snow in the Northern Rockies uh we're pretty much doing pretty well here in New England\nYou know hey let's at least that's a good a good sign their unfortunately are those that are some of that other whether a is not going well down south as well\nIt's moving about Thirteen fourteen miles an hour and it's about a hundred and twenty miles off the coast so that's the center\nSo if you do the math uh it's about eight or nine hours away so our time is up to three this afternoon I'm sure a there'll be some a serious video coming out of that area Panama City in to the east of that and then even parts of the even Atlanta could get some strong winds are out of the northeast almost like a nor'easter of rain\nYou're listening to W.

afternoon\nThe early morning commute tomorrow maybe just cloudy with a little bit of missed that's about it but showers moderate at times into tomorrow night a front end will be monitoring the hurricane\nWhich at that time will be strong extra tropical storm friday morning or could generate some strong winds and heavy rains down on the islands so again that is something that will monitor because it's not that far away and a little bit of a change in the track would bring it up into this area but right now it looks like it stays away that means friday we started out with clouds in the

forty\nTwo now on this Wednesday morning a Seventy degrees Seventy one degrees right now it's beautiful sunshine out there we got some ah some light than a wispy serious Clowes we've got some nice a blue skies and the sunshine flying over the place this morning as well [noise]\nAh we've got our music history will do that in just a couple of moments and as I said Paul he will be coming away very shortly and just after nine o'clock ... row will be joining him once again on his monthly visit as well and now Jim quarter now standing by with the latest updates once again on the forecast you\nKnow do a lot of sunshine out there just some occasional scattered clouds roaming through if you didn't see the trees and some of the changes in the colors you'd go out this morning and you'd think it was still summertime out they were going to reach eighty degrees\nAgain eighty degrees is like our first week or two of August in terms of temperature which today average is sixty four that we will get back to that later this week but certainly not today as I've been saying\nThis may be the last time we see this type of weather and until maybe next may so I just think about that wins out of the southwest five to Fifteen mostly cloudy tonight after midnight could be a little bit of missed\nBack into the mid sixties that's it again the temperatures this morning we're higher than the average high temperature for the day that's how unusual this is twenty plus degrees above average then tomorrow periods of rain so we'll call it frequent showers\nVery tropical tomorrow to head of the hurricane which will be moving through the Carolinas tomorrow temperatures in the low seventies\nA few moderate showers right too much of tomorrow night and then as the storm\nThe low seventies a few moderate showers right too much of tomorrow night and then as the storm moves closest to New England still buy two hundred miles to ourselves it could graze the island with strong winds and rain not necessarily certainly hurricane force but bad enough\nOr early friday morning and then breezy drier cooler weather moving in on friday afternoon friday back to where we should be low sixties on average and then again with some gusty winds will monitor that for I Would affect some of the activities friday and Saturday\nSaturday sunshine in the mid fifties that's it so back to reality even below reality in terms of temperature\nAnd then right now another one of these cases as we continue to go through the season of the coldest so far perhaps on Sunday Morning I'm going for a low of thirty nine yeah here we are talking eighty this afternoon and we could be looking at thirty nine Sunday Morning\nAnd back to about fifty eight or so Sunday afternoon or both or the red Sox games at Fenway and the Patriots' games Sunday night a weather should not be much of an issue certainly will be a cool one those Saturday Night at Fenway for baseball\nAnd then as we go into next week another front coming through with showers by as early as maybe Monday afternoon and then even cooler air mass settling in and that's when I think we have our first shot\nOr ... or by some not necessarily freezing temperatures but frost conditions Wednesday morning so about a week from this morning\nIs our first threatened frost now that doesn't happen then\nWe'll have another shot at it next weekend this weekend so we're slowly up losing down in temperature Don but boy today as a win saying it with you ah you know if you have one last thought of maybe I think I have a chance to head down to the beach today\nI Know I don't work for any beaches making money out of this by saying it jokingly or why not I mean eighty degrees on the tenth of October sunshine most of the time why not\nYeah even if you're not going to jump in the water and just go out there and just walk around the the shoreline why not\nThe water and just go out there and just walk around the the shoreline why not\nYeah why not and again you have good visibility with this is again a bit more of a Caribbean air mess slightly like we've had on occasion in the past so not a lot of decades or anything for the most part so\nAgain really about as good as it gets if you if you like at this time of the year and as I said today is like the opposite would be in the wintertime when you get that one last snow fall maybe in late march early April\nAnd you say wow man I Try to make one more snowman and I know this will be it until next late fall and winter well that's the way to look at today's eighty degrees last chance of really enjoying warm temperatures will have a few days in the seventies obviously down the road but uh eighty degrees\nI don't think so and by the way the hurricane now I have two hundred and forty five miles an hour Michael's going to be\nDevastating to areas near a Panama City you know that area or anyone that's down the Tallahassee which is inland a little bit but that's of course the biggest city down in that area or the capital they are going to be\nHammered in Tallahassee or perhaps in more ways than one but no seriously a wins gusting even in the city to about a hundred miles an hour\nPanama City points to the east there's an Airforce base down there tend to\nAh they're likely to have winds of a hundred and thirty miles an hour in the next do four or five hours and I'm sure\nWe'll be seeing video of the storm surge it is the classic bad taste set up off of the Gulf Coast the waters there are very shallow in the Gulf of Mexico so all that water piles up it's almost like a nominee of a hurricane because the as the waves get close to the coach they the waves get bigger and as does the courage\nAnd so uh most of the damage from this storm is going to be from the storm surge and then inland\nAs it gets into Georgia South Carolina North Carolina where they had the hurricane three weeks ago Florence still with some flooding there that'll be enhanced because they already are instill rough shape\nWith some flooding there that'll be enhanced because they already are instill rough shape and parts of the Carolinas so this thing is really going to be a devastating thing a really right through tomorrow afternoon and then we will get a glimpse in low especially Nantucket\nOn friday morning but we we benefit yet again back side of that storm friday afternoon is going to drive some cooler drier air in just in time I think for the high school football games friday evening\nAnd Red Sox and patriots this weekend\nAnd we'll see what happens that's for sure I dominant taught you ... know\nGang sounds good All right ah coming up to just about twelve minutes in front of the hour as we are starting to wind things down on this Wednesday morning with our music

right off the bat well I don't know if it's the most important but it's what I'm most concerned about a mirror up how she doing\nMira is at home right now she has fully recovered from her surgery or for some listeners who might not know mirror is my dog and\nShe has been part of my horse and pony show us the beginning um she basically without knocking on doors with me back in two thousand twelve she walks and parades with me\nEr visits schools with me ah reads books with me to show and tell she'll go ahead and visit senior homes and senior centers with me so um she's been a big aspect of my political identity and um you know both two and a half weeks ago\nI think it was his last friday of September um she had a tumor that was pressed up against her spleen the tumor weighed about three to four pounds\nAnd the dog herself she only weighs about I'm thirty three pounds is about ten percent our body weight\nAnd it was pressed up against your spleen and that are finally ruptured her spleen her stomach filled up with blood and she was dying from internal bleeding so I rushed her to her vet and then rushed her to the hospital in a wall pull the tops of the hospital and they uh they told me she wasn't expected to make the night which they saved her life and\nUm you know the outpouring of support was a pretty amazing you know people people loved dogs yeah um but she uh was than a week later because they took the tumor they did a biopsy on it a week later they found out that she has a terminal blood cancer\nSo I I started her on chemotherapy last week um the chemotherapy basically will double the life expectancy of her\nUm the chemotherapy basically will double the ... a life expectancy of her so instead of her having about a median of um [noise]\nOf a three months you know it'll be about six months now so I get an extra three months out of you know her but you know there's a basically a fifty percent chance of her living six months in a ten percent chance of her living one year but if you were to see her ... her right now I have no idea that she's sick\nBecause she fully recovered from her I'm from her surgery and then you know she's just a little a very energetic little animal\nWow agent uh twenty seven writes in at seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for the mayor's dog can read\nThe mayor's Tonkin you mentioned that we read books together ... as you

bags the A R a Beagle club road what's going on in union street\nUm highland a country club what we're going to do with that property but I Want to start with um something that uh it's a little old now but there was another kerfuffle I'm of the sun chronicle\nHad a editorial about it and and the issue is a temperament\nAnd I sent you a clip I'm uh from the day where I reviewed the sun chronicle editorial I didn't include that part that was like Fifteen minutes long you have too much to do but I did include like a two or three minute thing where I compare\nThat was like Fifteen minutes long you have too much to do but I did include like a two or three minutes thing where I compared to you because we all have strengths and we all have weaknesses and I compare Jews to John Adams a because John Adams or whether you agree with his policies are not obviously\nOr cared about this country cared about the constituents sincerely wanted to do what's best a foreign his case the country in your case the city and I sincerely believe you do as well\nBut John Adams wasn't graded taking criticism or he had the aliens and sedition act which tried to squelch a free speech and you've kind of been\nAccused of of that as well of having a little trouble with a difficult it was going to play pat Bennett towers hit me with your best shot to lead into that question but I have it cued up forgot to play it right so I'm just less addressed that right off the bat and then we'll get into more serious issues\nYes the uh I I actually emailed a crack Borgia is the editor of the sun chronicle after that editorial came out and I said ... basically got everything wrong I'm\nThere you know there's\nThere's been a number of clashes I've had with different people over the last ten months\nAnd first of all clashes are normal ... there's nothing wrong with a you know clashing it's part of the whole dynamic of being in public office I don't know why the sun chronicle or anybody else thinks that this should be a perfectly smooth running\nA you know a tenure with you know no hiccups there no ... you know problems anywhere I I just I I reject that as\nA normal politics you know so but that editorial that you're talking to one of the sun chronicle it blamed me for um you know having a an unresolved union contract when the union threatened to the fire union threatened to pick up my house\nHow was that my fault you know I mean that that's just that's normal contract negotiation tap things is not knowing\nKnow I mean that that's just that's normal contract negotiation type things it's not normal threatened zones pick ticket picket someone's house um but you know that you know that's just\nYou know par for the course of you know being management and being labor I mean that's

A. R. A. and all over the world at W. A. R. A. radio dot com ... heroes in Studio\nHe'll be here about nine forty five or ten o'clock or so let's try to officially move through some issues one of our remote correspondence\nAsked about the plastic bag issue of anything that reduces the use of plastics which come from oil\nIs fine with me but my question is is this the kind of thing where we should try to educate people about the issue for instance Sally Jay my wife who passed away she first bought reusable shopping bags in Nineteen eighty one\nAh social should this be an education effort or should we make a law and been them well\nThere are eighty ones towns and cities in Massachusetts that have already done this the language the ordinance that I submitted was basically identical to what was done in Mansfield with just a handful of minor tweaks you know stuff that I grew up in the state level legislation\nWe've been trying to do and are we being the city government um you know the health department me uh\nThe Iraqis had numerous articles is on chronicle about this we've been trying to do a public awareness campaign we've tried to do that for maybe the last four or five six months or so and you know going on for quite a while\nAnd you know these plastic bags are still ending up in the recycling stream which is a real problem ah for recycling efforts because the gums up the mechanical devices that are used to separate things and you know there is a place to recycle these bags and it's at the grocery store itself\nBut we've been doing that in our efforts have not been um fruitful so on the one hand as the a practical you know in a like a kind of local issue of the recycling stream but then there is also the more\nIt's kind of local issue of the recycling stream but then there is also the more global uh you know act locally think a globally type of um you know environmental concern I mean these plastic bags are you you know created using petroleum they uh don't dissolve they they rarely get recycled they float around you can see him\nYou know in in the gutters politically you know stuck in bushes and stuff so the response I've had I mean\nIf you were to I have like I like to look at my Facebook page a lot because I have seven thousand people that follow it and not everybody ... one of my support or um you know but\nThe response has been overwhelmingly positive now that's like not a scientific survey by any means you know it's it's not even necessarily representative um but the response from at least the people that have been following my page seven thousand which is a good number has been overwhelmingly positive handful of people that say oh it's government intrusion as for the government but you know it's\n... that we we band things all the time and they're eighty one other cities and towns\nConservative towns are conservative cities liberal uh you know towns liberal cities you know that there's a nice cross section in Mansfield\nIs by no stretch of the imagination more liberal than ... than adults and so that was as I said that was the most recent one to um you know to pass this just recently so it's it's a this two reasons that could've been a problem\nThat the coffee that's why I keep the lid on my head off right on the keyboard yet I Lived was on it that's why I'm a regular cups aren't allowed in here you have any things with less you call it will be all the caller just hung up row of either that or I dropped my coffee coming up with a caller calls\nBack but basically this is ... this is something that's been done in eighty one cities and towns throughout Massachusetts liberal and conservative it's a very practical matter um and you know ... you know I I don't see a problem with this and it's not up to me it's up to ...\nAnd the rest of the city can use that but that parking lot is slightly regulated and then the residents a Beagle club road get to use their street again they can park on the street [noise]\nUm but that is also slightly regulated it it's not gonna work if we just let anybody park anywhere because that invites a problems to be club road that's why we because of the resource of Manchester reservoir it needs to be slightly regulated to you know we have and that's not\nSomething that I came up with that was basically what the\nResidents of the road and the residents of the rest of Adam ...\nSaid was sort of necessary but looks like you have a call\nYes we have a a we have a phone call here at five oh wait two to one three to zero five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty\nHello good morning\nDid they leave\nAre you there now [noise] up\nThere we go All right five away to two to one three to zero five or way to to to Thirteen twenty maybe they were just trying to interrupt you fall\nI think it was just left them speechless\n[laughter] that could be a couple of remote correspondence here at a seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for Asian forty two about the plastic bag issue writes educate and legislate the use of plastic as an existential threat to us through the disruption\nUm or distribution of them are for through the destruction of the environmental ballots I Know I'm more in favor of the education half of it you know as opposed to passing laws about it until it reaches a point where it's a driving up the fees of recycling because look what happened there was a ... ... so I'm\nI'm not sure my hundred percent on board with you but when it gets to the point where it's causing\nTaxpayer dollars I'm not going to stay advocate against that are yeah in a way of it\nBut that is where we're at at this point because these things are contributing to the ah basically contaminants in the recession\nBecause these things are contributing to the ah basically contaminants in the recycling stream these plastic bags and that's exactly where we are right now that's why I had the conversation waste management\nBut you have the the parking lot that would get used by people from the rest of the city slightly regulated you have to register to use it um which is not out of the ordinary you have to do that and a lot of places and pay a small fee that this is a precedent for that and then there are um you know the people get to use the street again that could have parties that you know\nSo but her and I are also working together on ... street which is a cut through you have a six or seven thousand cars go through that did that in South Adel borough\nAnd so there's it's a very small street very tight residential street all the residents agree that there is a traffic and speeding problem so her and I've worked together on coming up with some solutions that we just had a meeting on that recently\nThere's another traffic pattern change and I was going to be around the new high school so I'm you know the second biggest issue in the city is probably not a speeding um the biggest one is probably trash that's when I get the most number of complaints second number of complaints or people speeding down the roads in different parts of the city\nI completely misinterpreted that issue I thought you were trying to prevent it\nThe roads in different parts of the city\nI completely misinterpreted that issue I thought you were trying to prevent high school kids from going parking on city property it completely [noise] raw material five or five oh wait two to one three two zeroes the number five a way to to to Thirteen twenty or you just mentioned a couple of big issues\nAgent sixty nine raises a big one of the opioid problem is a huge problem\nOr maybe there could be a drop in center where addicted can use or get health and safety rather than in fear of arrest and OD in store and restaurant bathrooms what is out of borrowed doing about this I was encouraged\nI'm I've been advocating the ah\nThe Portugal plan when Portugal years ago decriminalized everything and they're ready to use has gone down the rate of overdoses gone down the rate of crime has gone down and the number of people seeking help\nHas gone way up so um I Know this is a much greater issue than just ... outer borough doing about this and I liked that Asian three sixty nine I Wish people did have a safe site to go to\nWell the city itself he doesn't have the resources to tackle this problem I Know individual city maybe some of the big ones like Boston or ... you know because of the economies of scale issue so we typically rely on the state to give us resources\nThe a fire department are our first responders\nUm they have on our can I Believe it's called she you know to revive people\nOr the police department see the police department is not carry that and some people think oh my gosh why doesn't the police department carry that well the the rate of response for the police and fire is actually a both the same\nSo they're almost it it's it's not cost effective for the police to do that because the the way things are like a\nWear out like they expire and especially in a hot police car so um but one of the things I've done to help look at this issue in the city\nCar so um but one of the things I've done to help look at this issue in the city was we have a substance abuse prevention committee that was up until I took office that had been defunct for several mayoral terms prior\nAnd that's something that I a task that committee with investigating coming up with ideas and solutions on what if anything we can do at the local level but it it's it's kind of like homelessness is\nTypically these bigger issues are you know where you need more resources than a municipality is I'm able to afford and that's why you have to depend on something like a state and this is very similar yeah\nAnd to take a a gray issue and just make it black and white for the sake of this argument or some people are in favor of having areas where addicts can safely use their drugs without fear\nOf an overdose or criminal prosecution other people feel that's encouraging negative behavior and that's the last thing they want to see where do you come down on that if if we had unlimited resources and you could set up a safe injection site would you do it or would you think that's what a increase the problem\nWe sort of have that with the Suboxone clinics um we have one right on ... street it's a right next to 'em whether lanes and you know a lot of people off from work you know concerned oh my gosh if you put the Suboxone clinics\nYou know and then all of a sudden the junkies are going to be hanging out with all over there we haven't seen that at all um you know so the problem with my both my mother and my father a pharmacist in my sister's a pharmacist and my other sisters a nurse practitioner I come from medical family [noise] um\nWhat did you do wrong you didn't end up in the medical industry\nYou know I studied narrow science and psychology I wanted to go into something to do with brain there's you know a psychology researcher something but I ended up in Saudi Arabia after September eleventh and now now I'm doing this so I'm kind of took me off in a different um you know a line of work but\nThe um my mother does a pharmacist she her she's of the bleeding\nWork but the um my mother does a pharmacist in she her she's of the belief has a lot of pharmacists are not all of them but a lot of them that you with Suboxone your substituting one addiction for another and you just you know made it legal so um that it's it's a\nYou know it's a really difficult issue I mean we're we look at this with marijuana now marijuana is now legal marijuana you know alcohol use to be pro prohibited but then I became a legal and [noise]\nYou know was it was legal then is prohibited than it was legal and you know marijuana in these things are I mean it it's a I Can't possibly it's um expect myself and I hope nobody expects me to\nExplain the solutions to these cultural problems that have plagued us for decades on um you know a radio show I I think it's it's a much bigger discussion\nAnd also I just do one or a there is a a drop in center you are not alone dropping center the last Wednesday of every month\nAt the uh Marie Unitarian universe little surgery on ... street I'm Kerry blue is willing to talk about that that is a great resource for people as well mayor Paul hero is with us we have a bunch of remote correspondence here we got to get to our nine forty five break\nA very very quickly or some more general issues and this was I paid to do this to you but like a thirty second answers are round\nYeah let lightning wrote um there were some um oh what's the word the ballot questions right already out\nOne in three I'm not even sure what question too is um you know I was going to ask you about yeah we'll find out a question three a very quickly out transgendered trends genders get to use the bathroom of their choice and as long as they use a stall who cares anyway where do you stand on that\nI Am a solid yes on question three and questioned three is not about bathrooms is about civil rights I'm just wondering when you go a little bit further on thirty seconds but I'll make up for it elsewhere question three is basically about civil rights about ah let me just\nThey can afford ultra question three is basically about civil rights about ah let me just really quickly biology is what it is to be um uh like uh your your sex is what it is to be biologically male or female your sex is what is your biological male or female your gender is what it is to be psychologically male or female\nThere is not in there should be no expectation that is a perfect one to one relationship between\nGender insects um there is no perfect one one relationship with anything in nature so um you know there isn't with this as well there are some people who are seem to cross over and there's one called transgender\nSo the idea is that you we don't discriminate against anyone based on their gender and any number of things so what this question three is trying to do is preserve the um public use\nThat someone could have if they are transgender so if a transgender person were to walk into city hall the library the hospital or a public restroom you know I'm at a restaurant they\nCould not be discriminated against based on the fact that they identify as transgender that's at the core of it has nothing to do with pedophiles are criminals are sex offenders and all of that stuff quite frankly is in my opinion it's it's either misinformation or it's not understanding the issue or it's it's sometimes just outraged here among during\nLike I said this last night\nIn the Nineteen sixties it wasn't you know with people of color and not being able to use the water fountains back then it wasn't about water fountains right now it's not about bathrooms\nA that is Paul Paul hero is going to take our nine forty five break and then come back and continue with our lightning route for the lightning round hit that wasn't very lightning like Paul Butler [laughter]\nOf all of a thoughtful well considered answer I don't know if that's what people are looking for politics now a days we'll

so have a few more peace and then you can have your ice cream\nSo the child the brighter she or he is and and now we're talking about girls the brighter she is\nUh the the more she's the brightness allows them to manipulate a better deal more effectively and their sensitivity um allows him to a focus on what is happening here that I can exploit in order to be able to have my ice cream first\nDads don't tend to allow that obviously dads and moms or you know some are different roles were reversed\nDads will tend to say excuse me sweetie you got to finish your piece before you have the ice cream um oh no you're selling me mom doesn't do that to me a while you can continue whining and complaining and then you'll have and there'll be no ice cream tomorrow night either oh you are really show me and um but what that is forcing the ... but then what the child ends up doing\nOh you are really show me and um but what that is forcing the ... but then what the child ends up doing with dad is finishing the peas in order to get the ice cream you know a number of things happen there when the child focuses on finishing the peace before they get the ice cream\nThey learn how to have attention focused rather than an attention deficit that they tend to get with mom and the attention deficit is substituted for\nBy a ... an ability to use your ... intelligence insensitivity to manipulate a better deal and so children raised by um dads are only Fifteen Percent of them have ADHD children raised by primarily by mom's thirty percent have ADHD\nAnd the importance of that is that the both girls and boys but especially boys\nStart a slippery slope when they don't have that postpone gratification\nUm they they are they do less well in school they do less fun activities I Do less well in life\nThey start being a respected last\nBy their their their peers\nUm and the ... and they feel ashamed of themselves and boys boys in particular tend to withdraw into video games to much higher degree and then when it becomes girl boy time they noticed that the girls are not interested in dating losers suddenly\nWithdraw into porn because it you know you get less rejection when you um what case in pornography than you do it in real life of relationships and so\nBoth girls and boys significantly are significantly damaged 'em and because you you're you're I can tell you're very thoughtful here\nI'll give you some real hard science on this when a girl does not have um father involvement might already by age nine hundred kilometers our for our about all living to eleven or twelve percent shorter for girls than they are um\nLive in ... eleven or twelve percent shorter for girls than they are um\nWhen she has father involvement by kilometers I mean those are the the part of your cell that I'm contains the the genes that protects you from cancer and other love life destroying um diseases and so the national Academy of sciences says that at age nine\nWhen a girl doesn't have a father involvement she is about eleven or twelve percent um has eleven or twelve percent predictably shorter life expectancy boys have about\nA sixteen or Seventeen percent a shorter life expectancy and this so this is real and we're ... we're seeing the importance of fathers and in Scientifically Proven ways on this is a major study periods in pediatric things with assets Seventeen\nI guess one thing that worries me about those figures if if you have a dad who either has a substance abuse problem or an anger problem where can be abusive and it is a lousy father cause some lousy fathers do exist they can use your information your research\nTo back their position that they should spend more time with the kids when they were ... and even some mothers who aren't good parents whether they have a ... or not because of other issues again whether abuse issues or substance abuse issues drug issues things like that so that's kind of a broad brush your painting with Dr\nYes the well statistics as a whole create by definition of project and so and there's absolutely I Would you would I Would be the same page in terms of saying that you know there there are parents that are obviously abusive and create a toxic environment and so one of the things that are schools\nCan do is to begin to start communication training and first and second grade in Denmark I ...\nIs to begin to start communication training and first and second grade in Denmark I went over to ... to Denmark and looked at schools where this was happening um where first second grade they start communication training instead of bullying training team in training and knocking each other training\nUm the um and that really has an impact however if we do start we must start communication training I'm at an early age because part of what we're really doing to prevent what you are saying about the men and being destructive\nHistorically speaking men had been valued only if we prepared ourselves to be disposable\nDisposable and war and disposable in the workplace we weren't first class citizens we were second class citizens we were just both citizens\nAnd this is really powerful myth of the feminine of we as feminist we didn't get this we didn't get\nThat men are second class citizens compared to women I wow directly after the Catholic Church about that were were women can't even hold the same position that that men can hold I Would I Would argue that ... he's the only force on earth still stronger and more destructive than racism\nI Would argue that ... is not as strong as the ... century meaning the hatred of men if\nWell what is it a kind of well learned look men have done to to this planet over the last six fifty sixty thousand years\nHave to an amazingly terrible things to this planet and it's largely it is largely the males as the actors um but yeah but we ... whatever we have something being done\nThere I'm to the plight well but they've also done amazingly good things to this planet we are communicating the way we are\nIn a way had not been that had not been developed by women or had not been developed historically but we work but\nThat had not been developed by women or had not been developed historically\nBut we weren't but and the and the reason we're not speaking German under Nazi rule is because millions of men around the world died to protect this country I'm from Nazi rule and we also we also died to exploit this country from the Native Americans\nAnd so but what's missing in this process and that type of assessment is that both sexes um played a very compatible role there was women had no interest in men who were not the killer as protectors\nThey had you they fell in love with the officers in the gentlemen not the privates and the pacifist\nUm this is yes both sexes are involved in this election of each other for for both destruction and constructive I'm ... and constructive outcomes but the the primary difference between men and women was that men developed heroin intelligence which was\nIntelligence developed for a short life as opposed to health intelligence which was which was emotionally sophisticated ways of dealing with each other and with women or and it's also health intelligence is preparation for a long life\nAnd so this is a really a and so what we as diminished it is to um we took the male obligation to be willing to trade himself for parents obligation to train boys to be a great marine like her dad was and to be willing to risk your life and and um and and and war\nUm and we ... we took that obligation of dispose ability um and we check turns it into a power and privilege but if we asked only our girls to read just even today to register for the draft at age Eighteen like boys are required to do in the United states today the most on constitutional law uh in the United\nBoys are required to do in the United states today the most unconstitutional law or in the United states is um [noise] we have on the one hand the fourteenth amendment was says he will protection of the laws and the other hand we have male only traffic just racial your son is required to register for the draft\nAnd if he doesn't it's a it's a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine as five years since ... and it's not being able to work for a school go to go to any school that federal funding et cetera\nAnd we don't even question that and so ah so all of that is ... that is the the willingness of us choose to be blind as a male dispose ability\nOkay we've we've got to take a break and then come back and you can you stick with this for a couple of minutes to combat sure sure absolutely go let me make a couple of comments about what we talked about so far I'm In my my experience in our house and I'm One of seven kids\nUh I was the uh I was the six and youngest for eight years then came the great northeast blackout then came my little sister the great mistake up [laughter] and people say that's terrible how can you call her the great mistake and they say that's not terrible to be terrible if we called her the mistake\nIn my circle who's been falsely accused\nOf sexual assault not one I'm sure it happens but I think I mean sexual assault and rape that is the most under reported crime in human history and I just think that's the bigger issue and that's where more of my sympathy lies then would of some boy you got mixed signals\nWell for ... you know every woman I Do know a number of women who have had a really negative sexual experiences that are where the man is\nYou know more than condemn a ball I worked at a great deal with my sister to report one of those yeah um and so I you know I I really don't have any issue with what you're saying there I Do know a number of people who have been falsely accused we have had a number of things in the news about that as well so that does also exists but the real of\nA challenge for for men is not false accusations about sexual encounters um it it although that we will be moving in that direction um for reasons that are\nToo long to just to discuss now but let me just to solution ... for a moment okay well I think the best\nThing that we can do 'cause you know we ... we all really love both men and women and and our son or daughter isn't so let's begin to uh buy socializing our daughters to share the risks of sexual rejection not by option but my expectation\nRisk taking is a common denominator of the world self made billionaire entrepreneur is\nWhen women don't share that a risk taking they don't share the\nBreaking of the glass ceiling to be those self made billionaire entrepreneur as\nAnd when the burden of rejection is only on men men will begin to continue to be the only ... able to endure the risk of rejection that are required to be the ... self made billionaire entrepreneur is the common denominator of a billionaire and self made entrepreneur is learning when you're very\nDenominator of a billionaire and self made entrepreneur is learning when you're very young to be able to handle rejection handle rejection and keep trying again\nAnd so I I Do couples communication workshops all around the world including just last week ended up in New York state\nUm and I discovered that when each sex creates a safe environment for the other sects to express their feelings not repress their feelings than both sexes really grow and compassion in love and so I think that the first step in that direction\nIs trashed a transforming the hash tag me to monologue into a hash tag me to dialogue um\nWhenever only one sex when both sexes Lewis\nAnd we're a ... and the only way we can prevent those Texas from losing is improving our men especially ability to communicate and women's ability to think that men are not just the oppressors but they have feelings in there and they and they care about women and they would die to protect women\nYeah I I was the shortest boy in my class from second grade through my sophomore year of high school when I finally reach puberty I couldn't get a date to my senior year in high school I went on three days and then came to city Hawkins dance where the girls as the boys are to the dance and she asked my best friend\nOh yeah [laughter] so you know I I'm for the first Twenty years of my life I had a very difficult time with the ladies\nUm but things kind of worked out in the end so\nThe message just be more patient is the is the message we have to change our entire culture the way we look at boy girl relationships I mean it just hack mark Moreno when he was in second grade he gonna shaving kits for his first communion president he was dating in sixth grade for crying out loud\nI had to wait till my senior year we all go through life it different paces I Do we have to completely deacon\nMy ... year we all go through life is different paces I Do we have to be deconstructed rebuild no boys and girls relate\nIf we want to change the male female tango at which time by the way in favor of um you know we we won't do it completely because part of it is our biology and you know if you look back at insects or\nUm any animal you will see\nA very similar you know ... of the female attract resist the male pursue protests and the females are only interested in the alpha males and the alpha males have to the surface manifestation of being the strongest like the book elk with the biggest rack is the one that gets the female\nAnd the alpha males the Buckeye elk with a big rock is also the weakest of all of the ... because\nIn order to get that big rack that gives them the surface manifestation of strength he has to exhaust thirty percent of his calcium nutrients had minerals\nAnd if he doesn't get rid of that big racket immediately after meeting period\nUm he dies from a lack of nutrition before the winter sets and and that's a metaphor for masculinity and so I I Would love to change that whole dance and I'm also\nAware that you know when something exist for it builds up over millions of years\nIt's a complex dance to change but I I think a beginning way of doing it as giving women in school encouragement and ... um permission to take those risks of rejection that will then prepare them for the economic liberation that that a freeze a woman from worrying about being dependent upon a male for money\nAnd it also means trading our son is to be father warriors I'm to be able to overcome the obstacles that it takes to be a equally involves father\nAnd to be able to go to a party and say my desire to be a full time ... father and not have the women walk away and never come back for a second drink and only the report is be sent his way these are some of the the construct\nAnd drink and only the reporters be sent his way [laughter] these are some of the ... constructive changes I discuss in the boy crisis book that you know that we can all take as families and schools\nAnd begin a discussion as to what you know what can we change that will be better for men and for women now that we're free enough to have options as opposed to what was the all of history until recently was about not patriarchy but it was about the ... they need to survive\nAnd men and women made different obligations and responsibilities and chose each other based on their willingness to play the those roles in order to survive and so to blame either ... for all those decisions that evolved from both sexes selection of each other is really a part of the toxicity that's in the air today\nAnd there is this is Dr Warren feral Dr phil we have to have you on again how do people get a hold of your books like the boy crisis and ah ah why men are the way they are\nYes if you're a fan of independent bookstores yeah and then go to the independent bookstores if\nYou want if you're needing to keep the your costs the lowest Amazon dot com right now as a sale on the boy crisis and so just going just searching boy crisis and Warren ... F. A. R. R. E. L. L. or um you know or just just search the crisis in it will come up on Amazon right away\nUm and I I still disappointed or on a time that went by fast were mentioning talking about alpha males\nAnd don't you know we watch National Geographic an animal planet and uh it is all about the ... and um yes we as human beings we're just animals we have the power of language in speech which they don't have but we're just animals and my biggest fear\nI'm In this whole a sexual assault crisis is not just how type a guys are wired that's how successful males are wired they see what they want they take\n... are wired that's how successful males are wired they see what they want they take what they want just like any other animal a I've never had anything close to a sexual assault in my life\nBut I'm also a very talented guy who was a stunning under achiever and the furthest thing from a type a personality is being a typing successful high achieving man just taking what you want is that just part of the package\nNo I'm ... so it's it's more complex I mean that's what men want as women and I'm heterosexual men want as women and ... if women said we will only have sex with and fall in love with the men who walk on their hands out men would be having an walking contests\n[laughter] men have\nDied a helmet when in my couples workshops I ask a man and woman\nOr would you be willing to take a fifty percent risk of dying in order to say if you if you knew with a hundred percent certainty that you could save here female partners life\nUsually about Ninety six to Ninety eight percent of people in the couples workshops some of them are coming there by the way with the thought of getting a divorce um as a ... they would about eighty five percent of the women by the way say they would do that also if there wasn't children involved\nWhat percent of people ask that depends how much is in her bank account\n[laughter] and so the the\nWe really have so I think a way of understanding men is that we have historically always died to be able to protect women and to become what women wanted us to be a and women want us to be women marry and have sex with\nThe alpha men not the whining men the men the men who say I'm I'm really feeling that I Would like to share the sexual initiatives with you um it really it gives me a fear of rejection when when I Am the only one responsible for reaching out\nGives me a fear of rejection when when I Am the only one responsible for reaching out and I don't feel as wanted as you do and why am I the one to always by the president said by your dinner and come and pick you up please\nI'll let you make this more equal with a man speaks like that when he goes oh that's a really good point intellectually by and um and so this is this is the complex this is the complexity\nOf the of the dance\nThat and we'll ... whenever we blame either sex on it we really missed the point that both sexes are trying to please the other six\nWow there it is that's a Dr William feral it's always been my position that women are better than men in every single way except in the checkout line at the grocery store come on ladies' pick it up you've got to be more efficient in the ...\n[laughter] yeah it's great it's great to talk with you and I look forward to continuing our conversation\nYou know the thing is the Big East makes the schedules so this past Sunday we had women's volleyball women's field hockey and women's soccer all the same day all starting at one o'clock ...\nSo we're we're scrambling to the camera people and but we got we got everything done which was good but I'll tell you the hockey nights or just\nScrambling to the camera people and but we got we got everything done which was good but I'll tell you the hockey nights or just the atmosphere inside Schneider Arena or for the men and women's hockey is just you know you don't mind being there on a friday and Saturday\nAfter they win national titles the atmosphere on Pembroke street is absolute bedlam that has to lead to my son who has nothing to do it Providence College living in a police state for three weeks three weeks\nAfter the tournament ended got about two hundred bucks and parking tickets for ... for those for crying out loud even though he parked in the same place you'd always part\nBut those darn Providence College students after they won the national title and hockey is looking into this concept over a ... they had a riot when it just very quickly this was my son was living on a Pembroke street and uh you know there are two kinds of people who live on ... street Providence College prep these you know the cabinet acts\nAnd um Providence College punk rockers and the two very rarely intermingled\nOf except for that one time after a big snowstorm or they went snowboarding off the roof of one of the houses that that is a bonding experience that was very funny [laughter] but anyway so uh you know my son doesn't follow sports at all of Providence College wins the national title and hockey a few years ago and they noticed there's this huge party going on down the industry so any\nProvidence a punk rocker the rate goes up yes hearty yes here we go so they had down there they were there for like ten minutes and cameras buddies think this is out of control and they went home\nSo when a party is too far out of control for rockers yet that serious body and that's it out of control party but wow five oh wait two to one three to zero five a way to to to their team twenty\nThe step of the game last night you know I actually did I actually did I I um my hot race still hasn't gone down I ...\nI actually did I actually did I I um my heart rate still hasn't gone down I ... what have been doing is watching like the beginning of the games and then taking like let me think all three hours off and live a productive life and then come back and catch the last three or four innings I Can't sit there for four hours I Can't do it I don't watch for our movies\nI'm not going to watch for our baseball game God I'll tell you but anyway so it it's time to go to bed\nSo I you know to the last flick through the channels ooh there it is ninth inning I'll watch this\nForty five minutes later the ninth inning is still going on and it really hit me 'cause\nI got to bed too late I was emotionally frazzled 'cause Craig Campbell did everything he possibly could to lose that game that gave me the Yankees and the Yankees just wouldn't take it um and and so I was ... when I came in and I see Paul hero or non sports fan\nLooking bright eyed bushy tailed wasn't stressed out at all he had a good night's sleep because he doesn't care about the red Sox rats\nIt was a I'll tell you this this World Series this

sailing anyway well you know it was funny 'cause 'cause I was Texan with with my buddy who is who is a huge Red Sox fan and um he's he's pretty mean because you know the sixteen to one what are you gonna do it to blow out\nBecause you know the sixteen to one\nWhat are you gonna do it to blow out you know he's like I'm Glad it came down to four and a three 'cause it makes the pain even worse on the Yankees because they were that close\nAnd that's I mean it is that's mean agent three sixty nine writes men are better at\nMechanical athletics\nWhile they're bigger and stronger that's both I wouldn't say mechanical I Know a lot of women who can help build a car over me\nIndustrial logical thinking not emotional thinking yeah and women are much better at things like empathy putting themselves in the other person's shoes women are much better at things like compromise I well heck I'll set up before I say it again women are better\nThan men period in every single way period except

... how's\nThis park okay the obituary\nColumn of the Boston Globe and I look to the right it says John ... already or some people pronounce it Gagliardi yeah Ninety One coach one most college football game\nThat's going on in Minnesota right that's right yeah he died at Ninety One I I just a couple of things here yet to quote\nFrom the university John was a winner in so many ways but both ... mostly in his ability to connect with others\nJohn honestly believe every one of his players were wonderful and he spoke often about how proud he was of the mom not just a weather played football but the things that matter most to John being hardworking successful good men unquote yeah this the Gagliardi retired in two thousand twelve after a record sixty four seats and doesn't it\nAlready retired in two thousand twelve after a record sixty four seats and doesn't head coach with sixty of those at St John but all male private college school and college bill a Minnesota yeah he finished with four hundred eighty nine victories a hundred and thirty eight losses eleven eyes or national championship with a Johnny\nThat means over eighty percent body I wow but he drew as much national attention to school with fewer than two thousand students with his laid back approach to support listen to this point yeah policy was not to cut any players\nFrom the roster and guide non strenuous practices that never exceeded Ninety minutes while another quote John Gagliardi was not only an extraordinary coach\nHe was also an educator young men and builder of character from St john's president Michel ... in a statement\nWith glee already truly made his mark was with the word no entire coaching philosophy was based on the list of knows a rejection of football sometimes to this big rituals that he tested as a player\nMr Gagliardi hated it when people call in coach preferring John instead wow long before football became safety conscious at all levels Mr ... he was terrified of injuries\nSo contact in practice was kept to a minimum and tackling was prohibited them this guy's ... yeah maybe one who want to be on the team could make it up and leaving a roster of boy than a hundred and fifty players\nIn the school of rest until I was a boy [laughter]\nTruly calisthenics no way simply hazing screening whistles superstition and even practicing extreme conditions if mosquitoes were squirming forget it\n[laughter] we have\nRoom without players the golden rule ... he said and the two thousand three interview with the Associated Press treat everyone the way you

undermined peace in the middle east his next book\nTitled the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out in a professor welcome back to democracy now like you and your first response was a shock to you like to so many others\nThat was a surprise because she puts such a a a a nice face and articulate face on a policy that is horrific in many respects\nUm this'll be Palestine visited Iran on so many on so many fronts um what she was putting forward while props red meat to the president's base is probably aboard the most Americans and has contrary to what she said made the United states much more isolated internationally\nIt's also interesting that timing many she just said and I mean they were saying that it didn't they didn't want to look like after the midterm elections but they say that last week the resignation letter was put in\nWhich was right after I'm a\nJudge Kavanaugh at the time testified in during the FBI I suppose that investigation so to say the least there was a lot of tension within the Trump Administration around us um she didn't say anything about this at the time but of course if she ran in the future she could refer back\nTo this period of time that she actually resign\nRight than to distance yourself from the president during the campaign by saying any allegations by women should or should be heard and to be investigated so she's a very ambitious woman if she's planning Iran should Trump not run again in twenty twenty or twenty twenty four the sets are up perfectly I mean it it fits perfectly that\nThe the ambitious calculating nature of the ... show at the un and in South Carolina\nI wanted to go back to um\nI wanted to go back to um\nNikki Haley said sitting next to President Trump and the White House um about her relationship with both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son in law Jared Kushner during the news conference she's single then out for praise\nJared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to read it and after the all the way I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in this administration\nThat was Nikki Haley again speaking in the oval office next to President Trump talking about Jared Kushner um this is your expert teacher a Palestinian American professor or the Edward Said professor at\nColumbia University um talk about Jared Kushner and what she described as is remarkable are incredible role in uh in dealing with the middle east\nWill you would only consider remarkable if you think that denying that the Palestinians have a role the Bosnian refugees should return or have any rights that under ... is a good thing that Jerusalem is the capital and should be a capital for Palestine [noise]\nUm the policies that she has put forward advocated so effectively in particularly uh our policies that are\nAbhorrent to most of the world most of the Arab world many Israelis or realize that this is leading them down the path to a situation where no compromise is possible where Israel becomes of the solar everything um and Trump seems to\nWould be would be free of condemnation in the United nations imagine if the United states shot down hundreds of Mexicans killed two hundred and ... wounded or maimed thousands across the border inside Mexico\nIn the sovereign territory of another country it would be completely unacceptable the Palestinians clearly don't have rights they can be the victim can be vilified by people like Nikki Haley the it's it's revolting\nVery the very the very description of the Palestinians as the aggressors and the Israelis as a victim Israeli snipers are targeting these people one by one\nAnd the Israelis are being defended by Nikki Haley at the United nations\nJust before the U.N General assembly denounced Washington's decision to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem\nA new U.S ambassador Haley tweeted a warning to other nations she wrote quote\nAt the un were always has to do more and more so when we make a decision at the will of the American people about where to locate are and say we don't expect that at least we helped to target us on Thursday there'll be a vote criticizing our choice to us we'll be taking\nNames the ambassador famously said professor how\nI mean this is the most vibrant expression of American ... exceptionalism I've I've ever heard um United States is not bound by laws the United states is not bound by conventions the United states does exactly as it pleases the issue of Jerusalem is a\nComplicated legal issue but it's not that complicated everything the United states has done his credit uh seven decades and it's like a little more of international\nConsensus uh as far as the treatment of Jerusalem and they don't care a lot of the United states under Trump to the United states has always done more or less as it pleases but at least it paid lip service to to to law and international legitimacy not under this administration\nOutgoing US ambassador to the United nations Nikki\nKnow what I'm saying not under this administration\nOutgoing US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley um I\nHad to say the least Ben whatever's happening behind the scenes in lockstep with ah the administration she announced in June or that the United states was withdrawing from the un human rights council accusing the council's being biased against Israel\nFor too long to human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and assess full of political bias regrettably it is now clear that our call for reform\nWas not heeded the significance of this\nWell you're in the United states is is claiming that only its views count the views of the entire world on these issues um um or or simply irrelevant as far as the solution is concerned\nThe United states has run interference Israel protecting in the United nations of for decades now um and I expect that to continue a irrespective of whether Trump stays on after twenty twenty unfortunately but this is the most egregious example of this I've ever seen\n'em I Want to go back to John Bolton because he's the powerhouse there now um last month the national security advisor announced the Trump Administration would close the Palestine liberation organization mission in Washington in response to a Palestinian effort to push the icy said the international\nCriminal court to investigate Israel for war crimes this is both making the announcement and speech at the federalist society\nTrump administrators shouldn't will not keep the office open when the Palestinians refused to take steps to start direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel\nThe United states supports direct and robust peace process and we will not allow the I. C. C. or any other organization to constrain Israel's right\nNot allow the eyes cc or any other organization to constrain Israel's right to self defense\nSo that John Bolton not Nikki Haley by um she has supported deaths and today is the day I Believe so at the ... going to close by and watch shows and what is the significance of this\nBlowout it's once again ... ... ... ... a diminution of the idea that the Palestinians can speak for themselves permission to married that they can have a voice in Washington that they can that they are a party to this conflict in fact there was a main part in this conflict and what the United States and Israel has had been doing is to sideline the weaken them divide them\nUnited States has refueling in Yemen United States is in his hand in glove and everything they do maybe not in his disappearance um but the United states has been since Nineteen thirty three that's the longest relationship the United states has in the middle east before Israel was even established before turkey join NATO\nYou know because in the middle east before Israel was when the report turkey joined they'd do a good idea would be a war like this very very close relationship that's not really changed one bit\nWell I Want to thank you associate holiday Edward Said professor of Arab studies at Columbia University the author of a number ... most recent brokers of deceit how the U.S has undermined peace in the middle east his next book the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out in may but says democracy now when we come back we had to Minnesota\nTo the dolls Turner's will join us in Studio they were just acquitted and we'll speak with climate scientists James Hansen who had hoped to testify at the trial will talk to him about climate activists and and about uh the hurricane that's bearing down on the Florida Panhandle stay with us\nJar by us on here on democracy now I'm Amy Goodman as we turn to Minnesota where\nStar bias on here on democracy now I'm Amy Goodman as we turned to Minnesota where a court has acquitted three anti pipeline activists who broke into an oil pipeline facility intending to cut off the flow of tar sands oil coming into the United states from Canada\nThe so called vowels Turner's and that clap Stein and Emily Johnston along the support person Benjamin ...\nAre part of the group climate direct action\nThe activists mounted a coordinated campaign on October eleventh two thousand sixteen and which they cut chains and turn the manual safety valves to stop the flow of oil through the Enbridge energy pipelines and four locations this is ...\nCalling and bridge from the valve site to warn them of the action\nNo we were going reminder in Minnesota and\nOr the ... sign for mines born six or seven miles from the verbal musician reform addresses\nStudents sure of use your resume and civilization\nMost immediately ... regime and burning them in person receives\nI'm going through and found new but when I was blown we're losing the loser donut you know\nOverseas where are you sure\nWas ... in a clip from the film without Turner says he called Enbridge energy and all ... and all ten people were arrested as part of the campaign that saw similar actions in North Dakota Montana and Washington state three other defendants who took part in the effort have lost their cases and face short sentences community service mandates and deferred and present\nThe Minnesota case was the first and only of the four valves Turner cases where a judge allowed the defendants\nUse a necessity defense the activists say their decision to break the law with necessitate by the clear and present danger posed by climate change later\nThe law was necessitate or by the clear and present danger posed by climate change later the judge ruled expert witnesses including three fifty dark founder Bill McKibben and former top NASA climate scientist James Hansen would not be allowed to testify on their behalf this this defendant Emily Johnston speaking after her acquittal Tuesday\nI'm very relieved to sit in Minnesota acknowledge that we can do damage and no damage [noise] ah I also admit that I Am disappointed that we did not get to put on trial that we hope that we very much wanted everyone to be able to here's a for jurors to be able to hear from our expert witnesses uh we did this action\nTo almost two years ago to the day Thursday will be a second anniversary\nBecause the problem of climate change is so urgent that we have to start shutting does harsh anti science down now\nThe trial came just as the United nations climate panel warned in a landmark report that humanity is only a dozen years to mitigate climate change your face global catastrophe for more we go to Minneapolis where we are joined by valve Turner's and clap Stein and Emily Johnston as well as Dr James Hansen the former top climate scientist at NASA\nNow the director of climate science awareness and solutions at Columbia University's Earth Institute\nAnd with us ... one of the attorneys representing the valve Turner's in their necessity defense she's also executive director of the climate defense project\nWe welcome you all to democracy now let's begin with a valve Turner's 'em yourselves Emily and Annette Emily begin by talking about the significance of your acquittal but first what exactly you did in October two years ago [noise] um\nI ... so we entered a we broke the links to a couple of chains a entered into the enclosures where the pipelines uh\nWe were with their values\nThey are into the enclosures where the pipelines uh\nWe were with their valves or we began to shut off one of those cells had but we had made to think he calls an advance so that I find companies could shut them down or mostly if they if they just chose to and we knew that that was actually a standard procedure 'em and they did in fact started doing that shortly thereafter\nAnd Emily John ... rather and clap Stein why did you decide to do this\nOr we decided to do this because tar sands are the dirtiest and\nMost climate polluting boil that there is\nUm and as Dr Hanson has said you know it's game over for the climate of these are developed so we wanted to shut them down um because they absolutely have to be shut down if we do have a chance of having our children and future generations have a habitable planet\nAnd you talk about your role as a retired attorney and arranging granny I'm quoting you represent\n\nWho do I represent as ... as an attorney\nOh I was staff attorney for the ... tribe for Twenty one years I retired in two thousand five\nAnd did some of your work there and form what you did hear\nYes to some extent um I mostly worked on fisheries issues and fisheries are the absolute you know heart of\nThe spiritual cultural and economic life of the Pacific northwest tribes and um the salmon are now endangered almost everywhere in part because of\nClimate change we have the issue of the ... the streams and rivers where the\nSalmon spawn becoming too warm for them to do that\nIt's an rivers where the salmon spawn becoming too warm for them to do that and we have a number of salmon rooms that are endangered 'em and threatened and in a couple of cases extinct\n\nJohnston you concerned about facing terrorism charges explain exactly what you faced in what you um you were acquitted but what you were confronting in terms of prison sentences and your other colleagues sure ... Turner's and other states\nYes so we knew when we plan this action that we would be open to all kinds of homeland security charges and and potentially federal charges um and ... statutes that were developed after nine eleven around energy infrastructure uh so we went into this with our eyes wide open a and in fact the charge that uh\nThat we received a main charge 'em was was one of those statutes um [noise] you know in a way I think that was a oddly lucky because uh it was overreach and\nOr you know they could have gotten us on past a thing or something else but because they went for something that they absolutely couldn't support that explains what happened\n... Kelly Kelsey Skaggs or you're an attorney for the ... Turner's were you surprised by what transpired first the judge ruled\nOn indigenous people's day uh Columbus Day on Monday that they could not have their um expert witnesses talking about climate change like building a kid that have three fifty dot org and like our next guest will talk to Dr James Hansen but then acquitted them explain what happened\nYeah same here I was surprised and both times um we received a ruling in this case a year ago allowing us to present the climate necessity defense um which would include expert\nPresent the climate necessity defense um which would include expert testimony as you mentioned um and then the last minute ruling a really rural that back\nAnd excluded much of the expert testimony that we had prepared a that seem to to be directly contradictory to the year old ruling in this case um so we were very surprised by that\nIn the immediate sense you know we are engaged in a in many kind of campaigns in Seattle and in Washington state uh there's plenty of work to be done not looking forward to getting back to it great\nMajority of that work is legal um but we do engage in some civil disobedience actions are and\nYou know we really with this trial we particularly wanted a ... to do then Saturday defense this would have been sort of a dream trial in terms of our expert witnesses a and our ability to present that defense the fact that we couldn't do that is to be pretty heartbreaking um and so I Know a lot of people are still thinking about\nWe're going to have ... working out there but we do far too in line at democracy now that are going to cost fan and\nBut when you are killing a sign that democracy now that are going to stand and Emily Johnston Kelsey taxing\nSo much on the Florida next weekend as well as wash\nHands for China [noise]\nThis week on devil is yes catch letters home to ... bliss family genealogy and civil war letters\nTaken from letters and documents from the late Eighteen hundreds this presentation tells us out of a resident David ... great grandfather Francis up by a bliss who served in the union calorie during the civil war you can watch this program and all of our quality programs from around the area in high definition on double A.

corporation since two thousand and eight following seven years as chief operating\nOfficer to negotiate and implemented a strategic and comprehensive restructuring of the company that dramatically transformed green mountain power and has become the backbone of a cultural transformation and service\nQuality improvement and we talk about that all the time at a bar and but at\nEnd of the day all those things you invest in and sustainability inefficiency had better deliver customer service Mary launched in ... and vicious energy vision to provide and this is what caught our attention south and we covered part of the story both on the blog\nAnd on the main site renewable now about this for her vision provide a low carbon low cost and reliable power to Vermont urge and Vermont has a\nGreat reputation is you know and and you're in Europe of Vermont lover and All right so we know you're you're juiced up for this interview as well um as a result the company has built for months largest

talk about what we're doing and answer anything that's on your mind well\nWe are excited as well the stories have been fabulous you're a partnership that we will be talking about with\nGM pie or sorry I already on the on the equipment so I didn't ... side is really exciting to us Mary Let's start off in two thousand and eight obviously you set out to build a bridge that as you said is low cost low carbon in ... incredibly\nResilient which is something that we talk about a lot here um tell us what's that you've taken to meet that lost the vision\nSure great so yes we did in two thousand in a way to launch division I frankly with our recent partnership with energy is moving in direction for that we probably never could turn back in two thousand and eight\nSo back in two thousand and eight I'm I feel like part of the cultural revolution idle at green mountain was\nCreating a company that is a customer obsessed\nAnd obsessed with moving fast\nFun and play in directions that our customers want and ... and\nA part of that we constantly talk to our customers through the typically valid survey means as well as regular meetings et cetera and and you know no surprise probably to anybody from on your system was really setting up a strong message back in\nA way which is hey we want to go as green as possible um and that and by the way we really don't want to pay more money for it\nAll started it's kind of a choking\nAnd I started it's kind of a choking customers have spoken and they want it and green and free cell\nAnd solitaire code island by the way let me formally introduce you to our one missile co hosts that probably the two\nGroups pleasure to meet you I'm On the radio I'm a big fan of yours and I've been reading\nSome articles your progress or a ... and\nYou know many of us in the field or kind of bunny ... the traditional you to ... patients and yeah and so to read from ... to see\nSomeone that utilities\nAre reducing refreshing was on the ... the words cultural transformation in you know some herd together right\nNow and then you know that that's actually you guys kind of why I mentioned that because I think it's a really important part of our story and why we are in a very different frame of mind and attitude about the future\nI really started with a real cultural transformation really you know is back in two thousand and one I said to the board my goal is to create the utility in terms of really being fast on ineffective customer focused\nCustomer obsessed um you know and particularly 'cause we're in a regulated states so someone really scratched their heads and say well you're a monopoly why do you want to do that and I say all the more reason I'm calling from my perspective\nUm so it it was a huge part of a blanket holiday show for us to be in a position to keep moving and the way they want it to move so really back in two thousand eight you know it it 'cause I I I mean we we all of a challenge I mean are my team loves it so we kind of went from joking about\nGreen and free to like okay you know like so seriously like just like any company how do we do\nGreen and free to like okay you know like so seriously like just like any company how do we deliver what they want and\nReally as I as I look at the economic model of our utility inanimate energy infrastructure and looked at where our customers want us to go which is really deeply into the direction of renewable energy and community energy and more personal touch energy you know where people want to have you know\nSolar panels on their home they want to drive electric vehicles I Want to make\nChanges towards you know kind of like the local food movement the local energy movement well from from an economic perspective odd to me it is entirely intuitive to move and this way because as we all know the infrastructure we have today was not built\nFor economic reasons it was built because that was the kind of only system at the time to deliver energy so back in a way we really launched this very aggressive vision I remember him in ... I remember really being grilled to Canada by the media at the time\nOf oh my gosh do you really think you can ramp up a renewable energy and these kinds of a percentage is that you're talking about [noise] um and and the answer is yes and we did more than what we set out to do back in LA\n... let me jump in just for two things come to mind one is\nExplain to us and I knew a few have real feelings about this is will explain to us what makes you to the no currently a bit of a dinosaur that that you need to change would be your customers\nAnd I'm guessing we were in a regulated environment and trucking and it was really hard to make any changes because we were so heavily regulated so how do you do that\nAnd so I Am\nThe regulated so how do you do that\nAnd so I've worked in both regulated semi regulated and unregulated and you know get regulated as a frame of mind and it's a prison that I think a lot of people have put himself and so\nAn email that actually it's so funny to say that because I think one of the point of the blessings in curses from my coming to this company was I didn't have any experience in this space so one of the things I said earlier in the two thousands just why don't we bury all this stuff you know I mean when you talk about the\nThe like millions and billions of dollars um in my mind that you would need to be re investing in what is is that actually I'm a hundred plus year old infrastructure delivery model\nUm I Would much rather dedicate those millions and billions to the energy company of the future of the energy system of the future which I think is going to end up being much more socio economically sustainable um you know the current system we have now and the U.S\nThey'll show economically sustainable um [noise] you know the current system we have now and the U.S loses anywhere from thirty to forty percent of its product [noise]\nUm [noise] you know if you owned a company I don't think you build a delivery system that you would naturally is thirty to forty percent of the products are Sally over the price I Will do it so it's it's you know that part of the exciting exciting challenge for all of us if we embrace that is\nYou know how do we envision a new\nSystem of delivery that isn't about reinforcing are bearing the existing you know and the reality that sale it's it'll be the and we probably need to do a bit of all that [laughter]\nYou know life is never a you know this linear streamlined obvious approach it's going to be a little bit of everything but guys you know what we should be moving to in our mind is\nMuch more you know a triple bottom line type of system that will make our community is more resilient over live predominantly on renewable energy resources on animal be economically more sustainable as well\nSo much to talk about here so we only allowed to narratives we could go on for quite a while but the\nQuestion that comes to mind for me in terms of resilience is that you you are basically responsible for being a reliable source in power for a Vermont residents if there's any problem with the reliability I assume a little fingers are pointing it you we we we frequently\nDown here in those situations where are the utilities are resisting change because of\nConcerns about reliability I mean one example that might not be the best one but we just did St Louis reform here and one of the things that the municipalities asked for in in a ... on the street lights parents need to use to putting meters and on the street light so that we could actually have real time doing\nUh they're very very interested particularly in the micro grid work we're doing but one of the other things we launched um and now we're trying to get a hundred of them in places where we've called the energy home of the future\nWhich is the easiest way to describe it is it's an energy extreme makeover\nSo we went in and took a working class family a in a in a harder hit area and uh and uh with with them completely transform their home from a weather is Asian perspective\nA efficiency perspective we we moved them completely to air source heat pump technology for their heating and cooling and hot water needs [noise]\nUm we put solar on the roof or where now thinking that we can actually take it a step further and have them become completely energy independent um and the result of all that is we dramatically reduce feral electric and their fossil fuel consumption\nWill he knew about that memory I noticed on one of the videos that I saw it on your ... your governor chemo with David you launched the partnership between GM pie and energy\nAnd he was talking about how your changes at the grid these investments in efficiency that you just talk about with a home as an example\nThese investments in clean energy would really help to drive the economy in Vermont\nSo we'll see what you are doing would help the economy jobs to do things that are so important to to people\nYeah great question I'm a huge part of why we're really focused on a lot on this one city in particular from Roland is because we believe that this will drive tremendous economic change so one of the things that's already happened since we designated as A R\nOne of the things that's already happened since we designated as a our our desire to make it the solar capitals New England what should happen in my mid year next year\nI'm is that it attracted um I think six new businesses have open in the downtown as a result it's brought in jobs the downtown Portland is at the highest level of commercial occupancy that it's been in over a decade\nI'm so with the weather is a show where the fish unstable is ah whether it's the heat pump technology that we're doing um eat that brings people that need to do those things were not agreement and powers and not\nDoing that with our staff we do all these things through partnerships\nSo it's really fostered and accelerated a lot of growth and a lot of those economic sectors and then even more important I think is that it is moving us to a more economic model for energy delivery\nWhich then that really unlocks a lot of economic power for a state right so if we can continue to sort of bend the curve bend the cost curve or delivered decreases\nThat that benefits the entire economy up Vermont and then lastly resilience benefits the economy I mean look at you know again Sandy's an extreme example um and gosh knows what kind of resilience would've made to be in place to avoid\nA lot of that economic impact\nBut probably some of it in a different delivery model could have been avoided or power could have been restored sooner\nSo um you know the economic dollars the cost of these kinds of events is huge so even if again we bend the carnival little um that has huge economic benefits as well as social and environmental\nSure who to do that\nOh you do do it and to ...\nTo ... to ... to students who won a newborn and women how much ... and the more issues future too much and\nYeah I mean we're you know we're part of the New England grid and so we are very uh for the portion of our portfolio or we have\nTo go out into the market we like the rest of New England are subject to what is going on in the natural gas\nMarkets and as we all know shell has changed the natural gas story it did and that\nLower pricing nationally but it has been in a long time but New England has some unique characteristics one is some constraints as you talked about and the other is a we have a lot of reliance on natural gas generation in New England so that means when the constraints uh\nHappen it can really spike up the prices [noise] um so so we care about the issue ... frankly I don't know that I saw socializing the cost of billions of dollars of infrastructure that wasn't going to solve the problem for another six years\nI I you know I I Am not so sure I thought that was the solution as much as just supporting economic developers that are already looking to build that infrastructure into New England um\nBut ah that aside natural gas we see it as an important part of a new future or one of the things we we ah highlighted with our partnership with with energy is this new beacon ten Stirling engine technology they have which is a combined heating power\nAnd then we'll start talking about how the eco friendly June is going to add to that legacy\nBank here we're actually in August argument on a narrow one of the healthy I work at in Ireland and we were fighting category either die from the ... the adequate and\nEnsure corner cake and took out\nFrom all around the dinner parties try to sharia that road rage walk on and\nOn and things like that and make it clear that we even while on duty on science do employers can work out at every door and\nThere I'll let you go and and that question\nWell I think um you know just backing up a little bit one of the cool things\nWell I think um you know just backing up a little bit one of the cool things is as you know above the AARP and group is it's\nA hundred and fourteen years old and fourth generation has migrated themselves from Canada to to New York to Providence and so forth a large company two hundred fifty million moving people around the world and the as you know the heart and soul of the company Kooning our company\nI'm part of the people and so I said you know the company has always\nStressed a couple of things and and hopefully you've seen this in in all of these programs you're talking about\nAmplify on that but we've always stressed I'm certainly trying to have a great relationship with our employees and and keeping people in places the builders and build their career\nAnd then certainly we've had a real bent on health I mean going back to early days in Providence as an example with smoke\n... programs that did not exist back then then I think the other thing you might touch on this is really the desire and Anne Marie you jump in any time says it's great to get your perspective as a fairly new uh employee of our parents\nUm but the other thing is that the desire to give back to the community\nOut or why not why can't you know if I can be a part of the research went into one employee working out\nAnd create many very quiet here around Thirty years showing at the age where people get older\nAnd they said but also when I'm at the age that people get older you know you have to think of taking care of yourself healthy employees for better or for that leads to a healthier business\nAnd it's not the first time right Christina I mean I think there's been programs for yoga and original awareness and ... is this kind of a continuation of a lot of the things you you and the team is implemented them\nAll over the years everything that's come in and\nEither before or after work for their own at the miners come in and do periodic classes nutrition classes workout but now there's just something on science powerless and people can use it if they want you to during their lunch break and this is currently available and it's not going to go away and like a class at my only be here six weeks\nThat's right it's a permanent addition to the facility and the culture right\nYes and it's free for their classes and our thanks for vendors free\nThat's a good point and I think we should touchstone Christina and I think you did a little bit obviously are put in benefits from this investment right having healthier employees were there oh less\nWhere they can manage things at home better and maybe even I don't know ultimately do you get a reduction or better rates on health insurance\n[noise] shown that when players on a flight to Sonia now for their employees their insurance rate at the cost down over the years and things and cleaning clay less money for the employer [noise] oh so that's what we're gearing towards ... down the road we'll be back in with our health insurance\nThe other thing that's I think kind of cool is I watch people come in at different times 'cause I think the gym is generally open very early right so they can work out before work\nSix AM seven pm Monday to friday\nSo there's a lot of versatility right they can\nOK I'm Shannon Monday to friday\nSo there's a lot of versatility right they can jump off at lunch they can stay after work I Know there's there's folks that come in real early and others it's too late I think the offices open will cause Brian I'm more for his ear 'til midnight I sure\nWe can we tell people they can do that and we don't want the same place\n[laughter] but um but I think the other thing that's kind of cool and watching the folks to me is that um attitude is different um you know I see people\nComing in even earlier now and working out and as you know if you work out in the morning you feel good for the day\nWhen I'm positive feedback from employees decadence managers everyone has something to say about it and it's all there is now we haven't had any complaints as far as like having a gym at work who everybody loved the idea\nYou know I I've done good positive feedback is well no Denver and want to ask you a couple of questions you're silly new to the company is that correct\nEight weeks now and uh where did you do prior to that\nI own a grant from Rhode Island\nTo that is a wonderful experience why don't you tell us on a personal level since you've experienced it for so many years we were trainers well did you directly work with customers\nUm actually train joined a gym and I enjoyed working I enjoy the confidence I enjoy the company and I actually purchasing jamming and why [noise]\nGet for twenty two years [noise] but I think our center oh well I tell you why the opportunity for everyone it makes it a point to the pay phone studies\nFor everyone it makes it affordable it around to the painful for studies at age ... percent drop in this country is that the people that they in wellness programs\nGreat for people to be able to get away from an extra step out on a treadmill when one way or allowed here all day and received very openly\nAnd I I Would say too and I don't know how you feel a boat credibly atmosphere when people are able to work out together and relax which seems to be more mundane as a way to put it\nOh definitely I definitely feel that because when we do things out of work we don't always get the speed and people in a more so you didn't meet different apartments different people so I think it's creating a much more positive atmosphere getting to know other people in the company to other departments other divisions where they might not have had that chance core\nParticularly great point brain word breaks breaks the um [noise] what's the word for it and you know where everybody's kind of a silo would I guess\nRight and I write a stress relief yeah had a rough day going up there for half an hour and you come back Mary ... energize\nAnd Marie I'm generally in your experience then because we want to you know I think one of the things to stress is a gym can be good for anyone right you can be young you can be middle aged\nOh absolutely endemic earlier too late even twenty minutes a week\nOr the handle at a huge difference if you're not able to walk on a treadmill for ... for an hour don't air died at two point five at a flat level forty five minutes and gradually build it up same thing with the wait don't start within twenty five\nMillion or you either ration and I think\nTo maybe it makes you more more aware of your body\nEither racial and I think to maybe it makes you more more aware of your\nBody you could think about um you know nutrition certainly\nAnd um even the\nYou know how you eat breakfast and lunch versus dinner and some of the things that can really\nImpact your metabolism and helped fuel a workout I guess the other thing and the other question for you is do you find that day the convenience isn't important to people so the fact that they are coming to work in our work maybe makes them a little more apt to do it and\nDo you find that once the kind of get addicted I'm an addiction a lot of times isn't good but in this situation and it is that once once they get that routine or that addiction\nThat they stick with it half\nThe people that want to walk outside the country in the journal and the convenience and also like to take the kids at school to get the get go early on and I would say I\nLike that like it at work on a great\nFamily a lot more people take advantage of it and when she was going to get what you were first out or you are traveling around here and you're in Georgia town by ...\nAgainst it works in conjunction with obviously you know advice from doctors and guidance from doctors and but ... as you know exercise has done remarkable things for people we've seen people that have lost hundreds of pounds we've seen people that have\nAbout the liability here's a two hundred and fifty million dollar company right was able to um kind of trends and all of that overcome all those hurdles and the end result if I understand what you and Emory has said is that it's really good\nAnd you really would you would do it again\nI'm Sorry repeat that body but\nWe love the well thank you so much for being with us good luck with that Jim I'm Peter are open for renewable now show that brings you the business side of green [noise]\nThis is the new album out radio network W. R. M. P. Hannibal Providence [noise] to speed\nAARP and from renewable now's business side of green that show that highlights the stories that are proving that going green and sustainable is the very best investment whether you are a global company small business or just learning about our new green economy I invite you to join me daily one to to the eastern standard time\nFor great guest in conversations on building a cleaner brighter future for more info find us at renewable no radio dot com\nFor more info find us at renewable no radio dot com\nYou're listening to the business side of green here on our and and\nWelcome to renew will now business side of agree with your house leader harp in\nFor the next hour we're in house sustainability and go hand in hand and now here's your house Peter Hart [noise]\nMake you so much ... welcome back every one issue and into Thirteen twenty the flagship stations for free normal now network renewable now dot com today's guests\nPeter Stevenson is the owner of all green it solar and one of the things we will do obviously is focus on renewables and in particular shoulder but more importantly we will take a look at how that is working\nIn a place where New England right Connecticut New England where there's probably a good reputation for good policy financial incentives multiple developers and really multiple applications as you look at the residential\nAnd the commercial market and we will get into some new technology that is pretty unique or certainly unique to all green it's solar down in Connecticut and something that all of us should be taking a look at and we're not going to tell you a lot about it Peter well but\nBut it is called it's inspired really by son flowers so you can be thinking about that\nA lot going on this weekend and we invite you really to participate in it all one of the things we are doing it all the post\nA golf tournament the charity the fundraiser that we do to do all those post interviews with sponsors and participants including the folks that you know\nThe interviews with sponsors and participants including the folks that you know and all the others and we thank them again new New England tech number of others or one of the things we want to do is really talk in those interviews about those particular companies their heart for the community\nThere advancement some of the things they are doing\nAnd why they are so committed in so many ways to the triple bottom line so we know that you've been listening to some of those there'll be a lot more coming on as a presentation great fundraiser presentation coming up for the checks to the charities\nWe also have together we can and this is all part of our celebration\nAnd this is the creative side or that we're going to be talking about tomorrow night really the the creative side of sustainability\nAs it looks under the prism though of together we can and it really comes down to this are you ready\nTo embrace the creative side of sustainability and learn how you can differentiate yourself\nYour business your organization or you individually and if the answer is yes than either physically or virtually you will be joining us for this creative side of sustainability the presenter as the guest Ron believer legal Allison ...\nWho is an environmental artist culture world ... re now just came back in fact\nFrom Italy we did a great segment with Allison not too long ago Susan e Fox is an artist she's an author an educator a creative coach she's doing a ... unbelievable workaround sustainability\nA mirror he'll each a male is the documentary filmmaker who right now her documents\nThey were he'll eat junk mail is the documentary filmmaker who right now her documentary is in fact focus and focused on Alison new some and we have ...\n... from who is the founder and really the heart and soul of full swing golf in Mali Andrus will be with us She's one of the directors of honey\nFor Haiti where you obviously have heard a lot about our outrage with Nick\nAnd his team into honey into Haiti using sustainability as our method for helping take and amazing locks in there and giving them and the kids all of whom are directly or indirectly\nImpacted by aids of very very bright future in a bright future or in a difficult place right in a difficult country that has been battered\nAnd so many ways and giving them hope\nAnd giving them a future um so all of that is going on lots going on on the blog ... and one of the things I wanted to mention as you think about this conversation today with Peter Stevenson the owner of all granted solar and you think about the work being done there in Connecticut the work being done\nIn New England right it is\nA collective effort we've been posting a stories really all week all month and they've been on a believable as it relates to the positive impact of transformation away from fossil fuel of investments in renewables\nJust smoke most recently how the air pollution levels\nAffect kids working memories and when we are able to temper those down we are able to improve their ability their cognitive ... cognitive ability to learn and participate and to grow at the same time we see\nTo learn and participate and to grow at the same time we see early data early statistics demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt how renewables\nAre saving lives right they are taking those pollutant levels down and they are clearly saving lives now how we move forward what technology we use and again what markets a robust and where renewables ultimately become ultra competitive\nAnd become the norm and then a lot of us on a state level local level federal or even international level stock to hit those milestones those benchmarks around one hundred percent right one hundred percent renewable net zero on our energy\nUse will Peter Stevenson is certainly helping people do that\nAnd again we're going to talk about some of the technology that is inspired by sunflowers but he really is the chief visionary officer and founder of his company and it really it specializes in PV design and installation it serves residential commercial industrial\nAnd the ... and don't leave that out right and even here in Rhode Island is you think about Julian dashing C. E. D. and all the amazing work he does with cities and towns municipalities\nHave a lot to do with how we migrate over not just in terms of policy but investing obviously in their own building and investing in getting too close to ... there's a net zero is possible so all of those sectors he works with across Connecticut and has done so since two thousand and eight\nHis focus is to deliver a world class customer experience same thing we talk about it often while continuously raising awareness on how PV solar can benefit homes and businesses So Peter thanks so much for being with us welcome to the show today\nAnd businesses So Peter thanks so much for being with us welcome to the show today You're welcome and thank you so in two thousand nitty Peter take us back to two thousand and eight what what drove you to start all green it's solar and what was in your background that led up to that decision [noise]\nWell you know even as a young boy I was always inspired and driven by the science is a I was first interested in renewable technologies specifically a photo takes over\nThe age of eleven after watching a science show called tomorrow's world out in the u._k. and uh that that you built my ... and designed a system for a model railway that was building and so the interest group from their\nA child from Italy ended up uh working in a background primarily with information technology for a number of fortune one hundred companies and uh\nAs my career progressed hum and with all the project management experience and exposure had within those companies\nI felt that the timing was right in two thousand and eight or that I was indeed a let's say you mature enough to manage and start up a an organization that was going to serve\nAnd provide the community with a good customer experience and so there is a you know that's when we decided ultimately to a start up and initiate and found the company\nThey are forgotten but when I think about universities and ... when I think about hospitals\nThey consume a lot of energy and to me we need to make sure there are a big part of the equation and I do know that you're working with them and as we get further in the conversation but to start talking about new\nTechnology and new technology that you have helped introduce there in Connecticut give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable now in our in may\nToday's edition of renewable now's the side of brain is being brought you by the marketing groups are then grading customers more light Rhode Island college regimes buyer and connect WB nation for all your office supplies\nAnd by ... furniture and not just [noise]\nOoh\n\n[noise] famous to some of those big salaries and just pick up a bunch of clothes and food center relief effort overseas you know all that stuff is going to cost more to ship and if it gets there probably won't even be used at least I'm trying to do something good that you want to help there was an easier way if you'd only catch the professionals will be able to purchase exactly what they need you know I never looked at it that way it's plain and\nSimple way to help the vet literally ...\nYou know the smallest dollars and give them some of them are even more\n\nOn your own business which is one of the most rewarding things you'll ever do\nBut it certainly is a need for nearly two years in business owners have been getting from\nSchool for free for mental\nHealth plans and helped\nMe a little mini squirm mentors\nAbout sharing their expertise to how much you should\nNot have long\nWhether you're starting to exist in\nOur mentors which you are\nMore than twice styles volunteers\nIs ready and willing to help and they were going\n\nOne of the things that inspires up and make a sport is getting feedback\nFound that the judge or do you want to be a guest or contributor\nTo make sure that\nMake sure that\nThose areas we cover\nMore and more there were won by nine nine\nZero zero\nOr new listener line\nThis is our ... and\nSo much for being with us on our and then we are with Peter Stevenson\nHe is the chief engineer officer and founder of all green at solar they specialize in t._v. design installation and served [noise]\nReally lots of customers diverse customers across\nConnecticut and have done so since two thousand and eight Peter we were talking about advantages or solar rise program let's say in a community in Connecticut there's been a lot in Rhode Island you bring a bunch of partners together you promote\nAnd you set a goal right I Would guess most communities say hey we'd like to get I don't know ten percent of our\nHousing stock\nWith solar something like that right generally\nSet a goal of this amount of ... to the amount of ... a ... boy yeah so and books really great about these programs for an extremely collaborative effort\nAnd to see ... cost stakeholders from the town a leadership for the Connecticut green bank to the service provider and in collaboration you know we deliver a very good product to their constituents of the town\nAnd you know I think it's interesting Peter when you read a lot about residential and I think sometimes people forget that they are investing in the future of really having their own smart grid at their home they'll have the efficiency they'll have good energy managed\n... at their home they'll have a fish and sea they'll have good energy management systems very simple could even be like a nest\nThermostat they'll have renewables they'll have used to the grid and they'll obviously you know if they have an electric vehicle there'll be some plug in maybe that's a backup generator they'll have battery storage so it's all kind of a component of get ... get really getting everybody to a smart\nGrid but I think the too often what is\nNot fully appreciated\nIs that really what seems to sell in neighborhoods for solar is having solar on homes it's not necessarily commercials or the ... minutes of ... or the state's\nPushing it it's I have it on my corner and you go by and you see it and you start asking questions right it seems very um basic how it takes off\n[noise] yeah that's very true um [noise] you know when we need to installations and a specific area we have our install themselves have the experience\nWhen you've of approach them as they're literally and stolen the system and the asking questions and then off to the systems operational over the homeowner themselves will have some neighbors and again you know a start asking questions\nAnd that's why again we focus on the customer experience of rule because that is why it's All right because otherwise the story is not going to be a good one [laughter]\nWell no you're exactly right if you don't meet their objectives you are in trouble and the industry is in trouble\nTell us more about the so ... do you still have a nest wrecked market there in Connecticut\n[noise] way into a but it's a little different you know the we have\nA little different so you know the we have the racks and racks and they are ... the ... primarily for a business isn't nonprofits uh the residential space a directed towards the Connecticut green bank incentives\nAll right so the residential owners don't necessarily keep them and trade them are they important because you know some markets have really vacillated in the value of those wrecks and I think Connecticut has done so certainly we've seen it\nA down in Virginia was or New Jersey it was crazy for awhile Massachusetts are they important\nTo the commercial market and then we'll let that talking about nonprofits right how you work yeah because they can't really take advantage of the tax equity but there's a lot of value to them so first talk about\nThe market on the racks and then we'll we'll talk about the nonprofit\nHere on the racks is still very healthy in Connecticut or the utility of a very good job of given the violence notice now when the bidding process has guns type place\nAnd they release the lights accordingly and uh you know you develop the project along those timelines\nAnd so you know what the hell in in the right market you know it helps a with nonprofits for example who can\nNot only save ... dollars on a setting the kilowatt hours but also generates a revenue stream through the uh the rec program\nWhat do they do do they sell those\nThings some cases they do a in some cases they just like the payment um it depends on the on the business um\nMaybe they could take the image from the utility or\nPrecisely yes the way the wrecks working Connecticut is the you know once you place a\nPrecisely yes the way the wrecks working Connecticut is the you know once you place a bit on that day off or if they are indeed awarded a the contract it's a Fifteen year contract so it's worth X amount of dollars for that period of time\nAnd that set a fixed rate\nAt a fixed right yes\nWhich I think is important and so that works certainly I think in the business community and and we think about tax equity you mentioned the I. T. C. right the thirty percent credit yeah that's changing though I Believe isn't that scheduled to be reduced as over the years\nIt is so it was a renewed last year which was great news of a five year period\nAnd I believe that it's going to remain at thirty percent on some of the year when the scene and then it's going to draw down a five percent for each year after that\nWill that materially impact your business because one of the things you noted is really the roads in the industry not just in Connecticut but it really literally is across the U.S which is very good job creation will lead impact your business\nOrder of an acre and how much does it way\nIt weighs about two thousand pounds a that being said it is portable uh it takes a couple of hours to install the unit\nAnd so it's extremely dynamic\nAnd as mentioned a self cleans and tracks the song or it's just you know an elegant product and that's what catches everyone's attention when we showcase the\nAt the home of remodeling show in January the Connecticut for convention center a folks couldn't believe what they were looking at\nAm I what I was thinking right what a marquee product to showcase as you said and to get people's attention and to think about\nI don't know uh you know even as you said in very tight spaces the opportunity to invest\nIn solar now when we get back we will get into some more of the details are obviously trackers Peter had been around a long time some people like them some don't I'd seen them used a lot as an example you would see him in hotels or where you'd have a\nYou know there are ... applications right where they might be you know for warm water warming um the pool ... they were more expensive some some said they had a good return others were not\nAs a ... optimistic or or effusive praise and so we will get into smart flower technology what makes it different how much does it produce you know how does it connect because it does it net neater or you know obviously

website and Facebook page I think all the website I Can't remember what she said and she\nFound I think she listened to or she saw some correspondence I wrote about the loss of animals and how animals are still with us and maybe she even listen to the show but she reached out to me and said that she has um her and you know I looked at the the um the message and she never said the name\nBut she said he's he's a big boy he's been with her Thirteen Years and\nAh you could I could just tell by reading what she poured that\nThat it was you know all animal lovers know when you're getting ready to lose any animal just how that your your heart just gets ripped down and you know one of the things she wanted to to uh tell me is can you\nMy dad that he's going to be coming and when I read it and I responded to her and I was in tears I was kids when I read it I was in tears when I wrote it because you know how I Am with the animals and um I could just you could just feel how much this this um a dog meant to Patricia in her ...\nIt just you can just feel how much this this um a dog meant to Patricia in her family and\nI Believe she said that today was going to be the day that that was coming I'm to the house or to send him to the rainbow bridge so I just wanted to make sure I don't even know she listens but it's just something I wanted to to um reach out to and just really um say there's a lot of love and a lot of white light being sent\nA from from all of us of absolutely into you know to every animal lover I mean you you don't have to be an animal lover but I think if you are I think you get that you that emotion that's why ... ... in August I did a show completely with\nAnimals so it's it's you know it's it's a very difficult thing and you know just like humans to\nYou know even though they're still with us and you know they just the physical piece changes it's like\nYou know it's like uh I I wrote to Patricia it's like a moth changing into a butterfly\nThe essence in Seoul is the same but physically you don't see the moth anymore right you see the butterfly\nSo it's it's the same kind of thing but that also doesn't take away from the sadness and the grieving and in the last of the physical piece so um but hopefully you know I'm getting validation sat there still windows helps us get through that grieving process and what we're all we're all different\nAnd I think what makes it different do at least from our own I speak from our own experiences that you know for animals you have to make that decision you know for for humans you know the decisions made by God or the higher power but you know when you have to make that decision that makes it really really hard\nBut I think I think it's still with the same with humans with God and I think you know spirit goes through was and they tell us when to to to win that has to happen or sometimes you know our pets are just taking\nAnd they tell us when to to to win that has to happen or sometimes you know our pets are just taken from us you were\nWhen I ... you don't with a human being you don't say next Wednesday You're going to cross over I'm going to take you to the doctor do you know have you\nI don't know I'm not just a matter of fact of not thinking of anything I\nJust keep it with you Stacy and if you get it okay you have to let me know you have to email me it's even the medium or a female dot com because your grandfather's very insistent on this and he keeps pointing a to you in that so that the\nUh so let me let me just also uh see what else because there's also a grandmother stepping forward one of your grandmother's has crossed out and get both okay I'm which one is a very interesting ones on one side once on the other so your grandmother's on your ...\nWhich one is a very interesting ones on one side once on the other so your grandmother's on your mother's side and the grandfathers on the father's side so your grandmother your mother's side um is with you all the time and I always say just like the grandfather I always say I don't know what your physical relationship was but all I can tell you that she's\nUm on on the um\nThe ... river um ... river is a river\nThis uh this is connected to your grandfather he keeps talking about this a boating issue\nOr drowning or something connected to you that was in the paper and it also could be years ago\nHuh so just just make sure that yeah you keep up with this new boating or people with a connected you like family or friends that you know now I\nMean we went from a family was like they like to fish around for that I'm aware of\nSo maybe not drowning but there's something a boating accident voting issue I'm gonna I'm gonna you don't move forward with it but it's something that your grandfather really wants\nYou to to to validate so okay uh\nUh in also a ... cherry tree said we wish you the name for you to ... ... my stepmother okay so step mom she's yeah she's here she's here yeah\nOkay so I just know that so this is step mom no that is connected somehow to that site so\nOh I Know what he's talking about I Know what you're talking about of course what is he talking about in\nMy um my grandfather looked at the made in my head to the states it is that part is like the south east I left the boat\nThe FCC is step but it's like the south east fell off\nThe boat drought herders high style is life yet\nA Stacy how safe\nIs so I'm so glad that you got it before we hung up so [noise] so now I Know that your your ... your grandfather's supporting you always like\n... you know how excited mark is that you actually got to be or a close over excited I Am\nThe worst part of of doing this job you're giving something and I and I know that spirits very clear and you know some people get it quickly some don't by hanging up and then me feeling and it's not about people listening is really for me thinking oh my God you know I never know if they got it and I want them to make sure they know\nYou know whoever's giving the messages so just know that that grandpa just wants to make sure you you know that there was a grandmother that you you didn't know long or was not close to\nUm I had one grandmother that I did not know what\nA perfect Stacey so not that you didn't know or that's not perfect but it's a it's a way to let you know that the the grandmother that you didn't know at all is my God she is like a helicopter hovering around you and with you and it's just taking care of you and making sure you're okay and\nUm but you know your grandmother also said to me Stacey that you've got um a there's some kind of decision going on with you\nYeah\nYeah well there's but there's a there's one decision that she keeps in and you're right I mean people have decisions all the time but she says there's one that's been sitting there for a long time\nIt yet I Know it's\n... perfect so and she keeps saying you just tell my granddaughter she just she knows what to do it in her heart it's it's it's in her soul it's in our heart she knows the answer it doesn't make like sometimes you know to make any kind of desserts\nTo make any kind of decision sometimes if it's not familiar it's not easy but she just is giving you this this big I'm a validation and shout out um [noise] uh your your grandmother also\n... was to some do meeting or or my fingers going like a mile a minute ... something something with their hands\nWith somebody that um you know they did to crochet or was good with knitting or um piano ... my fingers are really going like crazy so that they saw\nWhat was that not that I not that I was about the grandmother that I didn't know\nWhen when they get validation to could be someone there validating someone who's living connected to you or someone who's cross but but the okay the fingers um ah well you know what or something to do with fingers or somebody somebody had a an issue with fingers like\nA ... do you understand ill ill yeah\nI'm so as long as you get it I mean was it um\nIt was my mother had rheumatoid arthritis oh that's what it is okay yeah I'm so your mom has crossed the U.S yeah\nSo so you know when this happens I'm it's just a way to let you know that your mom is stepping forward your mom just said a couple of things to me she said too so I don't know if there's two kids\nI'm now I'm an only child\nOkay so what's what's the to February February or the or the second half a month now so that comes to mind just just keep it with you ... it\n... me and my son who they were both very close enough that\nI don't I don't think so you what the other\nWell I don't I don't think so you what the other thing if your mother keeps talking about is the birth the reverse or that's really close to something very very close\nLike birthdays or ... okay perfect\nSo she just saying that as happy birthday did she come from two over there to girls two boys she keeps yelling at me too\nYes it was one of ... I Wonder if it was like\nPerfect that'd be what it is so it's just it's just a mom just giving that as a um a validation and um there's also public transportation your mother keeps talking about I don't know why\n[laughter] you understand that yeah I ... well\nThere's there's a bus right outside the studio and your mom literally just turn my head and said just look at the bus and talk about public transportation so she said she my daughter will understand it your\nYour mom is with you and your mom also said at nighttime or Stacey she's with you and to you go to sleep I mean she's with you all the time but yeah it's just a way that she says she keeps saying she ... she crosses your head you're here and just to let you know that she's\nShe's with you and that you know that bond has never broken if if that makes sense yeah\nI'll make sure you also talk to your mom\nI'm as much as you can either verbally vocally or mentally because your mom says she loves 'em she loves when that happens and there's a ring\nShe talks about ... well what's the ring I I just feel like well I got engaged\nA very very Stacy how it's just mom letting you know that she knows and she's been there and she she she she knows what's going on I think you think when you get married you're going to do something brings something of hers or is it your mother just said ask her\nBring something of hers or is it your mother just said ask or did\nYou think about wearing something or having something or doing some kind of memory for her\nUm well kind of what I've heard about it I have I also have a modest rang and I was like it that it was\nNice enough that's what she's talking about\nUm that was the ... of course because they're they're all moms right mom grandmother is giving that as a as a wonderful beautiful validation I'm Stacey you just know that as many people as you see whether it's for people or whether it's a hundred and fifty at the wedding you know that there's way more in your mom is\nFront and center so just knowing that she's going to be with you and\nI'm uh in in in ... also watching her dad so um but she said you your dad's diet is is outrageous so yeah he's\nEating stuff he's not supposed to eat so that's what she's telling me so she just giving that as a a wonderful validation but Stacy listen thank you so much for calling and just know that um they're all with you and your mom has not gone anywhere and just such lots of love 'em to you\nOkay thank you so much even thanks Stacy\nI'm OK well before we go to the break I just wanted to make sure there was something interesting on Facebook Live somebody to maybe when we get back you can ask I answer that but somebody said that her mom guy asking for her and she didn't get to see her and she thinks mom still upset\nOkay so that she ... the question is does mom no which is okay we'll do that as soon as we come back from break awesome\nThe hyphenated name is that you know like when women get married they'll keep their maiden name and then a ad on their husbands name\nOr their wife ...

class project but having like an actual representative of our community and being such a high statue of being a congressman and having him so local it kind of got the point across that this is a
