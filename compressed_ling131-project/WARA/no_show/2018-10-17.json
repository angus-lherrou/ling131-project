sixty degrees yeah going to be mild but tonight yeah much colder lows in the mid ...\nMile but tonight yeah much colder Mose in the mid thirties more tonight yeah we're going to be waking up to a very\n... through Europe Thursday morning we get all the details now meteorologist drew Corman standing by once again for assume\nWell during the weather pattern or at the moment featuring up and down temperatures but not too much away ... that\nAre both well as we go into the weekend sunrise this morning still yet to occur it'll be one minute before seven so left it was about sixteen Seventeen minutes or so we were dealing as we see a little light a few high clouds but that's about it we're going to have sunshine to stock\nUh and then we'll have a few clouds this afternoon will become quite ... out of the southwest once again like the other day in that sense temperatures up the sixty\nSo today what are these days once the sun comes up the soon we're going to see the temperature sky rocket right now we're cool and calm for the most part just a few light breeze is\nGoing to be a completely different story in terms of the will to borrow morning at this time and that's what the

quarter moon reminder we have the full hunters wound coming up on the twenty fourth week from today on northwest wins though taking over tonight as I said earlier I like to always talk about how you can manipulate the whether good or bad\nWell how it affects you close your windows tonight and maybe for the first time or maybe turning all that heat if you're someone like me who is still not turned on the heat quite yet uh well it might be finally the night tonight as temperatures fall down to the mid thirties by morning\nBut northwest wins tomorrow morning I'm like right now when they're almost didn't come out they're going to be averaging Fifteen to thirty miles an hour so you obviously think what you hear that if I have a window open\nOr it's going to be cold and that will then tomorrow sunshine\nThat if I have a window open or it's gonna be cold in that room then tomorrow sunshine highs only in the mid forties but wind chills starting in the twenties will rise into the thirties that's it so again the first really chilly day for the season we've had\nThat on Friday after we started out ferocity many areas will have the first freezing temperature thirty\nEven if you up or

see one two three four five six seven yeah wrote down a nine questions I should have asked her should have asked her while she was with is um so we'll have to get her on again or the lovely Carol McLaughlin of the ...\nUm she she um she got to exercise exercise\nOr or not one not two but three different occasions a mindfulness trying not\nOh not one not two but three different occasions a mindfulness trying not not to lash out an anger when someone does something stupid in front of you in the car trying to relax center open yourself up to the universe um but you know when this happens when you're driving your behind some of his\nPutt putt putt putt putting along putt putt putt putt putting along let's go wild where y'all I Know you may not be in a rush but I Am I've got places to go putt putt putt putt putt putt putt putt putt all there's the yellow light then then they step on it\nThen they realize their car has something called an accelerator and they speed up then yeah they get through the light and you don't goes from yellow to read and you have to stop happened two or three times on the commute she said the first time she got a little upset second time started getting a little more upset and then she remembered\nMindfulness mindfulness\nI don't have to I can I can choose not not to let their\nInadequate selfish driving upset me or or I can choose not to so she did two things she tried the mindfulness approach\nAnd who's getting home and that didn't work because while takes a little while to get good at that uh she called me invented the narratives five oh wait two to one three two zeroes the number five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty so she tried to she tried mindfulness\nIn that situation uh hopefully with more practice she'll get better at it I guess I've heard people talking about mega millions I guess the mega millions is up to some huge\nJackpot I'm Out now over six hundred million or something like that I don't I never read the lottery numbers on this show I don't follow the lottery I don't play the lottery never bought a scratch ticket my life never mind mega millions or that stuff\nI don't play the lottery never bought a ... ticket in my life never mind mega millions or that stuff\nOr just don't trust it it's another aggressive tax hey hey I Know will tell people they have a chance to win millions and they won't even know it's another way another way to get the poor and working class to support our tax base so the rich don't have to wow the lottery yuck\nAnd are over six hundred million is that the right figure actually I take that question back is that the right figure I couldn't care less if that's the right figure I couldn't care less about the lottery I mean I Do think it should be legal because if we didn't have the lottery we'd still have\nYou know rocky working in Philadelphia as a a leg breaker for numbers runner and the loan shark I'm so people are going to engage in that kinda stuff so we might as well a sanction it let the state get their cut\nBut uh\nIf it is six hundred million whatever it is a six hundred million to one person one person that's insanity that's obscene that's awful how about a set of one price for six hundred million you have I don't know six hundred prizes for one million\nThat would seem better to me and level off the odds with the mega millions if you're going to rush out and buy your tickets knock yourself out of don't worry you won't have to wait behind me in line\nFor that [noise]\nAlthough and now now if I'm waiting in line behind you to buy all your lottery tickets and you never know which ones you want first um instead of instead of getting waiting in line behind buying behind people buying lottery tickets rage I'll Try to use\nAgent sixty nine writes in lottery was a democratic idea I don't know whose idea it is I I Would call it a necessary evil idea um that's kinda my libertarian leanings gambling I don't gamble\nYeah um that's kinda my libertarian leanings gambling I don't gamble I think it should be legal\nProstitution never been involved in anything like that in my life I think it should be legal marijuana use or in the heck with marijuana use or every single drug out there every single one of them I think we should go all Portugal decriminalized them\nYeah that was a fun show about a year ago we went through a whole list of songs that make you wait level one just for listening to them\nYeah\nSixteen you're beautiful and your mind although in some states mostly southern sixteens quite legal but yeah the British Oh thank you Kim Kim

dollar\nPeople will cash or Social Security checks then run to the casino when suddenly to money to ah two hours later all the money's gone\nThat's not such a wonderful thing or let's go to the phone lines to speak to the amazing Jim Corbin with his meter logical update on this beautiful beautiful autumn day good morning Jim\nYeah the morning Paul beautiful beautiful by the way I agree with you with the lotteries they should have the state lotteries should have like thousands of winnings so at least you know if you're not going to get as much if you win but you're going to get better chance of at least winning something\nYeah we're talking about the mega millions drawing up which I hear is over six hundred million I have no idea what it is I don't care what it is 'cause I never bought a lottery ticket or a scratch sticker on my life\nBut I think that's obscene I think that's horrible over six hundred million bucks one person and how many lottery winners it ruins their lives I mean money brings convenience it doesn't bring happiness but yeah instead\nOf one six hundred million dollar winter I don't know how about a hundred or six hundred one million dollar winners then we have six hundred people who can ruin their lives with free money\nThat's it [laughter] anyway by the way Barbara you can put headphones on if you'd like to hear Jim but it might roughly your hat and they came here and you can okay\nWant to say yesterday all the great interview with the the Buddhist none are in I mean that's a really positive way she didn't like and now she sounded like an aerobics instructor\nA in a really positive way she didn't sound like and now she sounded like an aerobics instructor or Yogi yeah in a positive\nWay it's she sounded nice and refreshing not the usual sounded but not\nYou know yes she's well she is a modern Buddhist non she had her she had her smartphone and her laptop open great sense of humor camera like that a camera like that the interview with her as well she was fascinating\nIt was good and so as the weather this morning now early this morning Paul I actually saw frost\nOn ... on my windshield which I have not been outside yet but I could look out the window and see it\nAnd that was the only for us we had a this morning on glass surfaces automobiles that are away from trees where you get the radiation or you sometimes see that if you park near a tree and you're in the early morning\nAnd you see the car next to this not under a tree why is that have crossed and this one doesn't well that's the reason glass or lose a seat faster than grass I say that because we couldn't see frost on the grass on friday morning but the big story this afternoon increasing wins we're going to reach sixty\nUh was already come up Fifteen degrees since about six thirty this morning so we're going to go up another Fifteen or maybe almost Fifteen from what we are right now\nA wins picking up out of the southwest up to thirty miles an hour much colder tonight as I've been saying jokingly all morning if you leave your windows open even a little bit\nLater this afternoon because it'll still be fairly mild and you forget to close them\nOr you may regret it late tonight because we're going to be down through the forties and thirties with winds up to thirty thirty five miles an hour overnight really coming in the windows the north and west facing windows or wherever you are so make sure you're close them unless someone who likes to camp out in your house or mid thirties\nTwenty ... well is it okay can you leave the windows open in if you also Simon was simultaneously have about Seventy five Kansas stern oh burning in the house\n[laughter] uh you can do whatever you want it you know I'm not going to tell you what to do or I might get sued but anyway they end up by the way\nYou can do whatever you want it you know I'm not going to tell you what to do it I might get sued but anyway\nI ended up by the way a reader from playing bill writes in regarding our last topic readers says silly boys Powerball is three hundred and fifty four million tonight mega millions\nIs friday and that's eight hundred and sixty eight million I'm going to be a billionaire by this weekend and buy a casino there it is\nYou know even if he did that you that ... so it's such a joke but they don't even tell you what you really when you have to pay half of it the taxes so why do we always say the amount of is\nBefore taxes you know a terrorist like it is you know that would let you know if you take the whole lump sum it's that much if not\nEight hundred million or it's not three hundred and fifty seven million it's probably a hundred and eighty million\nOr whatever while they had to do is they have to take the winnings then immediately by all kinds of real estate property\nMake millions more on that and then claim to the government that the properties Abd appreciated and not pay one penny and tax just like Jared Kushner remember our own president told us not paying that cheating on your taxes that's what smart people do only suckers pay taxes gym you know patriotic citizens\nTaking that money that the lottery gets from the winnings ah you know half of it or whatever it is and get back to a lot of people that needed that would be a nice thing at any rate we're going to have temperatures falling to the mid thirties\nThan back the sunshine mid fifties tomorrow the big story really beginning this afternoon through about mid day tomorrow strong winds today at southwest that's why it will be fairly mild\nAnd I said that rang a bell for mayor had some meaning for me and because it meant so much to Steve and\nSo of course the donation didn't come anywhere close to what to what we actually did and um [noise] and so we started down that road and I I made a couple of connections with people about properties and\nAh people to talk to and actually the property so we're located in\nSheldon ville section of rent them we are on route one Twenty one it's the old Sheldon ville nursing home which so many people have a memories\nOf it being I'm nursing home I've had so many people come up to me and say they were a nurse there they or someone was a maintenance man the cook the Girl Scout who sang Christmas songs to the U.S seniors they are at Christmas Time um\nThat's the property that we on right now uh we purchased it in February\nWe uh open to a couple of months ago we are as I said it's a structured sober recovery has which means that we have twenty four hour supervision at the house we\nOh I have three ... cheese with four layers of wallpaper and covered by paint and one wall\nHalfway would that removed and it just looks awful so when everyone when everyone in southern Russia to the gym Rhode Island is sober if you could send your career over to my house search to to fix my ruined to do it yourself projects were talking to our Barbara ... of Gilead house which has only been around a couple of years\nUm I just interrupt to the middle of a ... month month month one guy and ah I offer ... off route one Twenty one uh-huh in rent them and are you are making a point\nThat I felt the need to interrupt about my failed yourself project\nSo we've done a lot to do it yourself I mean we ... like I said we've had a so K. P. high school has a group called the KP cares which is their outreach community service organization they have spent a huge amount of hours they're\nUh we've had hoped out of high school and mount St Charles\nCome all these kids came on a Saturday or Sunday spent the day did um as I said stripping wallpaper cleaning floors or I'm painting we've had a E. M. C. has come for a number of days the emcee encourages their employees to do community service\nWe had um a company a Hal I'm corporation and Fox borrow came on a Ninety five degree day and spent the entire day doing all kinds of projects around\nThe house um we've had many faith based groups come to that has to do all kinds of work it's just the community\nOutreach an outpouring has just been amazing we have had literally probably now getting close to four hundred people who have come to volunteer at the house and it is a major\nFunding come from I mean did did you\nHave come to volunteer at the ... and it is\nA major funding come from I mean did did you rent lease or purchase the property so we purchased the property oh did you hit mega millions and just write them a check or where did the funding come from Barbara\nOut to a great question a took a while for us to find a mortgage uh we put some of our own money into it we found a a Milford national bank was a wonderful bank to us\nGave us a mortgage and then frankly the woman that we bought the property from gave us some second mortgage also so um but it was not easy putting it all together yeah and\nUh now uh so sober recovery has is a I don't get any funding from anywhere there's no insurance pays for people to be there\nAnd it's all private pay 'em so the people who come to live at the house they all have to work everybody we're not getting around that and you know or you need to keep busy and uh so people are either working or doing community service or something around our\n... you know the ... has your or around some other place in town a so that they keep busy they pay a program feet to the house and uh otherwise we really rely on a on a community for donations\nAnd um ... what happened was just to give you another story OK backstory here was one Sunday we were working at the house and a couple of came in\nAnd uh said we were at church this morning and the minister was talking about ... has and we knew we just had to come in here and they had lost their son a year earlier and they asked if they could decorate and dedicated a bedroom in their son's name and that was\nThey could decorate and dedicate a bedroom\nIn their son's name and that was kind of the beginning of something that we never planned on it all every single bedroom at the house and all the rooms as a matter of fact have all been I'm adopted\nDedicated and decorated and I loved\nOne's name wow uh parents who have lost sons every room has a um [noise]\nHas a plaque on it in the name of a young man who's passed away and the rooms are gorgeous it's very homey at our house every room has kind of a different theme like one young man loved music and so the whole bedroom is decorated kind of music came down to his guitars is in the room\nAnother um young man was a fisherman so they painted a couple of the walls blue and one of his fishing rises hang on the wall or\nIs there a room with the left field wall at Fenway Park painted on it or\nNot but there are plenty of sports memorabilia around the house in ... you know men and it just seemed to be easily go to that\nWell up when you have a little a few extra shackles in the tech I'd encourage you to build a nice Wiffle ball field out backward activity age and fifty five o get to your question in just one second uh we're talking to a\nI'm Barbara why did I just based on your last name ... right easy to do yeah yeah right yeah uh uh the chief coke bottle washer at a ... house which is a sober house up for men um I Know what it's like to lose a spouse I Can't imagine what it's like to lose a child\nUm what prevented you from just swallowing in your own pain and depression\nAnd actually turning this into a positive for so so many hundreds maybe thousands of other people where did that strength come from\n[noise] that's a hard question\nPeople were that strength come from [noise]\nThat's a hard question to answer I don't know I just knew that I had to do something I couldn't just let it go like that I couldn't just let that happen and and\nQuite honestly you know everybody grieve differently and we all know that and there I certainly now I'm In touch with so many parents who with losses and you know there are some people who are finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning\nSo [noise] um what I Do have to say is that the parents who have done things that Gilead has feel\nSo empowered about their grief because they're they're moving forward to do something in such a positive way and uh the camaraderie we just had last night as a matter of fact\nThat group of people who parents and\nLoved ones who have named drums we just had a dinner together last night at the house and with the residents they are and the residents get to meet the people who is the rooms are named that you know the parents of those rooms and it's just an amazing\nUm camaraderie is the only word I can come up with of such a warm feeling a for everybody and you know I had one\nUm set of parents who went and bought some clothes for a young man he had been homeless for a while and I went and bought him some clothes and and people just feel like they're doing something wonderful which they are out of such a great tragedy here\nIs a saw my we in the Gulf Baghdad did that on purpose sober three years did it on my own\nHer place meaning Gillis place sounds so much better I Wish it was available when I was sick do you mix drug addicts with alcoholics they're totally different addictions is yours scaly house for any kind of substance abuse addiction or is it just like opioid abuse or just\nIt's for any substance abuse addictions\nHave you found any issue with uh like alcoholics or opioid addicts or pot heads ...\nHave a mix of people have what they are drug of choice was so to speak whether you know alcohol or some particular type of drug\n... and honestly I think we've just created an atmosphere in a culture and our has that uh that doesn't matter and that I think all the guys would tell you that it's kind of all the same and I\nI don't mean to cover that lately at all\nUm but I think the guys in the house I mean they all go to AA meetings together and ah we do have starting to have some in has um there is a tremendous camaraderie a tremendous amount of trust in the has the right now we ... we have a seven people living in the house [noise]\nUm so it's not twenty and I think it will change when it is twenty but um you know I think we have a solid base\nStandard when it is twenty but um you know I think we have a solid base all our staff are all in long term recovery yeah my house director worked for nor cap for 'em I somewhere around ten years so I feel as though he's extremely experienced a number of other people who work at the has\nHave um are also a counsellors have received licensing to be drug addiction counsellors so um you know I feel like we have a really solid staff\nAnd it's funny with with opioid addiction opioids it seems more than than alcohol and other substance actually changes the wiring in the brain [noise]\nUm so it's a it's not just a matter of discipline and you just have to tough it out and it's for an opioid addiction it's almost impossible to take that alone it is almost\nImpossible you really need support you need to get rid of any of the old relationships that drag you down um you know some people need to really leave the area that they were living in completely uh my son\nWent ... went to ah to Maine to celebrate as he also went to California to some rehab and the place that he passed away it was in my house so um you know it was right here back at home with somebody that he knew\nSo that's why you know for some people they need to go away I it it varies as much\nA you know with what the treatment is as you said earlier I mean you know some things work for some people on some other things worked for other people\nKnow there were more correspondence is I don't think it matters what kind of addiction or they have um the twelve steps worked for all of them I was at Alcoholics Anonymous\nAh oh it was\nThe hawks anonymous uh\nOh it was that Alcoholics Anonymous was the first one with twelve steps again bar but you know you know you've got more about this huge issue that I Know but from what I've read the the the uh opioid addiction seems to be a little bit different and how would change changes the wiring of the brain a couple of philosophical questions um\nMany many many a psychologist or psychiatrist tell us we have to get to the root cause what's the cause what's the hole in the soul that the person is trying to fill\nWith drugs or alcohol or some other thing uh everyone Bradshaw was around about Twenty years ago and uh we had to heal the hearts of the inner child that was big for a while my mom bought us all a Bradshaw books\nAnd then there were some people who go with the tough love root unique tough love dammit life's hard we're not going to make it easy for\nYou and that seems to have faded away a little bit and now the total support mode is coming back into vogue the total support so not to make it a black and white issue but ... house is that more of a tough love kind of place where is that more of a total support kind of place [noise]\nWell I think [noise] excuse me the philosophy that we've tried to change over the past couple of years which has really made a big difference is eliminating the stigma\nSo years ago nobody would've ever spoken about a family member who had a drug addiction and so it became something awful for not only the person who was active but for the family as well I mean I have someone who is dedicating one of the bedrooms in the house\nWho lives in my neighborhood and she said her brother passed away Thirty years ago from a heroin overdose nobody can talk about that that and I mean it it just was never spoken I'm back\nSo the fact that somebody is an active addiction now at least\nThe fact that somebody is in active addiction now at least you can talk about it there are other people that you can talk to about it and there are support groups just for that\nAnd honestly we've had so many people come to that as they drive in the driveway they walk in the house and they just started telling their story because they know that our houses a safe place to talk about it\nUm there's a difference on your tough love the I think the word would really be enabling and I think so many parents you know all we want to do is just be able to fix things\nI think that's sort of where society is right now\nAnd and I think unfortunately for kids I mean\nThey think it's a two second facts and I think that's part of the issue especially for young\nPeople who have active addictions is that you know they just want to get my now my son Stephen I mean he just like just let me have a couple of weeks and then let just wanting to be perfectly batter and unfortunately it just doesn't work that way and it is all about long term recovery and I feel like I really need to\nThrow that in there before we finish our conversation because unfortunately I think government and insurance companies are as well looking for quick fixes\nThere is really no quick fix you know all of us have some habit\nThat we'd like we'd like to change whether it's we want to lose weight we want to read more we want to relax more whatever whatever it is that we want to do we don't change those things overnight it takes a really long time and this is the same thing for recovery from addiction\nAnd it takes a long time and we you really never hear so start listening now when you hear a government our insurance does no support from those at all for people who want to be in long term recovery\nAnd uh insurance if anything has gotten shorter and shorter and what they'll provide even between a deep ...\nHas gotten shorter and shorter and what they'll provide even between a detox and um and going to a residential rehab\nI'm a halfway house um insurance has gone shorter and shorter and what they're willing to provide and again it depends on what your insurance is which that's another whole subject about the maze of out there\nThat's a nightmare for parents because they just don't know like which road you go to and what do you take what do you do which places okay which plays isn't okay what will my insurance cover I mean we we\nHad such arguments with Blue Cross and my husband actually went there in Quincy to take paperwork because they kept saying they didn't receive hours I mean it very frustrating especially when you have a child who you know\nIt could be his last day you know so a long term recovery is really the only way that people are going to get better from this and and just to circle back on the uh enabling a tough love ... I mean it is it's hard for parents to uh\nTo be able to do to cut themselves off on certain things with their kids are not to account just do this one more time kind of thing it's very difficult and I would be remiss if I didn't mention learned to cope which is a wonderful support group for\nParents or a loved ones with someone in active addiction and it's specifically for that and\nAh they're all local chapters a there's a one an adult borrow there's one in Franklin a it's a wonderful network for people to go to that again there's no stigma nobody judges you almost everybody's been in someone's story somewhere along the line so\nI'm even feeding their obituaries now used to be a past suddenly now\n... um even see it in their obituaries now it used to be a path suddenly now a bill mentioned exactly what it was trying to bring attention to the issue and then even place you know in lieu of flowers pleased donate to places like ...\nEven passed away I thought it was I didn't want to act like I was ashamed ... and um and I thought if he could help somebody else now eh man meant the world to me\nIf this table wasn't so big I give you a giant hug right now we're talking to Barbara Gil meister of Gilead house G.

is a huge deal and it still rich white people who are providing most of the money and according to his column and the New York times yesterday um\nAnd this goes back to my earlier point about um I I Am a lefty I Am a progressive but I Want moderates to be the biggest group\nWow wow\nDon't walk conservatives to be the biggest group out of what progress has to be the biggest group I Want moderates

as Kris Kobach cross check [noise]\nThis whole issue of having one of the candidates for the she also be in charge of over she election process so could you talk about that as well\nYes and so I imagine this year you're playing a game where you're trying to win but you're also the referee and so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is cute\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity would require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nUm we had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had a sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies tried to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down um\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of\nInterference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making is what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question and legitimacy of our electoral process safe and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process and sitting on top of this one undermines that Brian cats\nElection process sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian kept the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor Twain and Sunday my opponent is unapologetically extreme she's banking on illegal immigrants to secure a victory for\nHer at the ballot box professor Outterson\nYes and and so that is campus so much like Kris Kobach out of Kansas I'm you know Kobach has been writing that lie of um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing the elections in Kansas and only he can block them\nAnd so and by raising the flag of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear and to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nAnd because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of a sudden or either closing the bowling places or shifting of old voting place would from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court and gutted the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision in twenty Thirteen\nWith the Shelby County beholder decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixth teen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it a hundred and sixty eight polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian camp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe the further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they consolidated the polling stations\nThe one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states so for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment\nFurther and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to be pressed the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery Kim has unfortunately built very strong record of voter suppression and yes he and I have\nTo leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore the cancel registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary cans and with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or form of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp and Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent\nWho asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp poop Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student try to ask him about his endorsement\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate Robert started going to want to jump through when\nSenator Purdue return the phone after student demanded it back\nOn Sunday produce office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie\nAnd senator misunderstanding saying the senator thought a student wanting to take a self ain't ...\nI'm\nA professor I understand if you could comment on that finished we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who is voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place by what's happening in Georgia\nI'm so first on I'm senator ... do\nYou remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is\nUm by praying for Obama's death by saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting of a song and you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue\nUm and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian\nKemp and Casey Cagle has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety ah and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component\nFor why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the the I I'm not sure how how risk it hasn't been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations have been very active\nAnd getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams in ...\nHas a message of hope has a message of how we build Georgia for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republicans\nUm that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republicans um because the demographics are changing so much in Georgia that the vote\nThe vote for African Americans Asians and Latinos has to be stuff down because the message that the uh Brian temp and the Republicans are bringing aren't messages that resonate with that population because ... those populations are in fact targeted by that their message\nAnd Carolyn Anderson chair of African American studies department at Emory University author of well most recently one person no vote voter suppression is destroying our democracy will be back with her and other guests in a moment [noise] [noise]\nOr because of having a felony conviction suggesting me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nWell first of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes enjoys bipartisan support we're not leading where the partisan nature of of this topic or or the issue of voting\nWith the partisan nature of uh of this topic or the issue of voting what we're leading with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that some interest in franchising now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign\nThat we have in brace and we're all on two\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity\nAnd because of that we've been able to get people that that that that that throw off their partisan clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other and knowing that wants to desert space is\nPaid so we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU or organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice and Florida writes restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing here I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves\nFor the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bakery above racial discord and connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people are\nAble to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican challenger Kevin Cramer a the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nSo the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that\nBut there's probably civically written to not allow PO box is count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I D and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now\nAnd the next election and then we're running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost ... percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised\nGroup in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as\nA Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas named Pocahontas as a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage and ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the twenty twenty presidential election\nJust imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her as history is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country and you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchised thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact is this\nThe voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota is tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to vote but this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerican writers in an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election is but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I\nHave a have these folks have their rights a vote before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very important people know that they can vote in North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have\nBasically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think\nThe best opportunity in a decade to make it easier to vote for millions of people so\nI think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different and twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWell we want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of Mother Jones will

will encourage you throughout this conversation to point people to where they can best learn about you and your team and what you do but I see a lot about maximum\nAbout you and your team and what you do but I see a lot about maximum human performance and kind of tell us what that means and how that fits with your mission\nAnd does show our our mission is a maximizing human performance\nThey not primarily we do it for tactical athletes\nUm those with mentally physically emotionally demanding jobs so when we think of our our first responders that are out there on the front line every day I'm you know the type of demands a day go through the military to him at um those out those types of um those jobs you know we have a multi disciplinary\nA program that your curriculum and education and training that hits\nNutrition conditioning resilience stress management and sleep we look at those five spheres\nAnd then you kind of pull those together and even small little changes one by one percent one percent increments\nAre really gets hit a big part of it and I know a big part of the show sustainability\nAnd that's what it's all about our for our program is about sustainability durability taking care of the individual so uh they can take care of us\nAnd as you think back in ... and then we're going to talk about what you're doing today and then you're going to expand going forward you're based in New England right up in Queens me there ... there was some of them are you\nOK I'm thinking back to your base schools when you started the company had a really a brilliant career in individual achievement in a short period of time that has no worthy\n[noise] what was it was some of those goals and why why would those are the those things driving you\nYou know I I think for for me getting out of the military and making the transition you don't have reflected on ...\nFor me getting out of the military and making the transition you don't have reflected a lot\nA lot of my experience I had a lot of the amazing men and women I worked with and it got to serve alongside\nAnd um you know one of my ... the co other co founders Palmer colors out we were teammates and the military together so we always started about talking a talking about building a business together and what are those core principles and what would it meant to us and we want to start a company\nThat for one was started with a you know great friends a solid foundation and most importantly to give back\nUm bras given back I I don't think anyone who serve their country can you know they just go out and in one day you're you're not wearing a uniform anymore and how can you continue to provide for those who who provide for us\nNow are we started when I transition I went to Harvard Kennedy School and I spend a lot of time um and are we talking about and thinking through you know what this\nCompany would be a we originally started uh actually the company Iron Man was a model that Paul and I really are talked about a lot\nAnd you get familiar with Iron Man it's a little bit more than a a swim a\nIran you know their memory and people will go to trained yeah there is nobody is\nThan that right it's a it's a brand and all we have speculated on everything that they did their training and education apparel so in a big part of our take away that we wanted to provide an experience where people\nSo we created the base to peak mountain race and what it was doing it was saying mission statement maximizing human performance it was getting people outside\nTheir comfort zones into natural terrain and challenges you by well we've been challenged the most in our in our careers in our life which is by Mother Nature alone kind of takes care of a lot um\nHere's in our life which is by Mother Nature alone kind of takes care of a lot um we had a a Base Camp\nSo when you think about the keys telling me about those keys and what is the basis of that kind of the science the data\nAround your your curriculum around what you teach in train\nSure well we take the nutrition conditioning resilience stress management and sleep but we boil it down to something that you know the big part is something as simple and that people that are you know they're going to remember so we boil it down into our curriculum is our methodology of meat eat sweat and thrive\nAnd so we have to go ahead\nNo go ahead and I just want you to give us some of the basics and are they in any order as an example do you say listen if you're not feeding your body properly you can't get to number two and three but kind of take us to the basics and how they fundamentally build on each other\nYeah so I Will say that we will wait are pillars\nA little known each other\nYeah so I Would say that we will wait are pillars the same\nUm you know a lot of some people focus on conditioning some people focus on nutrition Jerome on the on the sleep or the stress management or or resilient but I can tell you that\nIt is um the multi disciplinary you know I'm way we look at it it's holistic and your way all these things the same way and you know like from a ... doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym and what you're doing it it's hard at work of that for right\nNutrition ... is is critical and then if you're not getting you know proper sleep and recovery\nUm if you're not doing the right conditioning programs or what your goals are going to be and I think that that causes a lot where we we start a high level with the program and with all of our um you know with all of our clients is like what is your goal what are we getting out of here\nAnd what is your job so we talk a lot about the needs and now this like what is your specific needs word of the demands of your job and also how do we structure something that we talk about go back to the you know the the sustainable side of it\nHow do you make this sustainable if you are\nYou know have some um you know a very interesting nutrition habits um I you know how you're going to maintain something that overall we always say if you're not going to do it for the rest of your life and don't do\nYou know that's something that is going to be very difficult to [noise] um I'm just a stain\nAdam you're willing to pause just for a second but it is so true in in the realm of sustainability in the room\nOf corporate and you guys are running a business speed is about reunions it is about endurance it is about not giving up its a boat consistency and if you lack that would reduce it it's in nutrition or it's an extra\nLack that what they were as you said it's in nutrition or it's an exercise or it's just overall discipline of how you run your life it's not going to work you will for fall short when we get back\nWe're going to get into some again more specific so I'd like to really pick your brain Adam for for our global audience about okay you know tell us about some of these theories around exercise and and what can work and and how to you adapted to\nMy goals and same thing with with nutrition and as an example big thing today supplements give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable levels [noise]\n\nLeader argument

our community So Adam is I read your material look through your day to think about\nYour training in your education your curriculum your your events including the ones where you went from base to peak\nGive me some specifics you know so I tried to work out pretty much every day and and I've always been told listened cardio cardio cardio and I know that that part of your formula was born out of the deal to mix the gold standard for measuring cardiovascular fitness but tell us about\nThe the training around around cardio and weight training and strength training and durability and the things that they use stressed that are important to all of us\nYeah okay well go back to um you know that the eight foot and thrive methodology right bill among the sweat portion I think that you know you do have to look at the man's like ... depending on you know what you're doing it you say you're working out every day and what\nWhat fine but as long as you're working towards your working towards a goal and we want to make sure that in our workshops and their clients we work with that everybody has\nYou know the right program for them and it's a structured program a lot of people are kind of putting on necessary wear and tear on their body that I may I'm going to go out and do my my three mile run again and it's like they're really not getting anything out of it but just that besides just breaking\nDown their body even born\nWhen you talk about those goals Adam should they be very specific to I Want to get stronger I Want to get faster I mean how how targeted all day\nSo they're very targeted it depends on the bike who were with if were worth the fire department I Will tell you that you know you're going to get ranges you're going to get um a sixteen year old a man who is who is three or six months away for a year away for retirement or\nOld a man who's who's three or six months away for a year away from retirement or you got someone who just out of the roof of the recruit training class so we talk about we for the recruits we have to talk about like we have to save them from themselves you know they're coming in there they're made of rubber you know there\nThey haven't found it and then you know I'm a masters in the world right\nExactly so but the thing is we're trying to get them we talk about all those pillars of conditioning nutrition sleep stress management building resilience and improving one percent and all these different areas and when you look at the conditioning side were like what is your needs what is through your job\nOkay you need to push things he'd call things you need to carry up to eighty Ninety pounds of gear 'em you need to um Thursday cardiovascular component to it there is a upper body strength and lower body strength\nAnd some people for example like we've come across people that I Would say that or do a lot of just conditioning do a lot of cardio but they don't they don't necessarily have that\nStrength show we have a a resource of them for ... you know we want something for everyone we don't want to lose anybody that comes to our program and truthfully we have something for all the listeners to they can go to our site at all to X. dot com and go to a tap\nWe call the tactical athlete portal right\nSo we want to bring resources and give something to everybody and we want to get them comfortable with something for us because there's sometimes that people believe it or not to come to our course that hasn't worked out and like a decade\nAnd and we're like OK starting with specific goals are not going to start that person with a a five day program\nI'm not going to uh because I don't want them to get intimidated overwhelmed I Want them starting with like like just a warm up just the preparation for a workout and maybe do to recover get you to your body moving moving again but some of these well rounded they have to build speed strength endurance\nWhich is fine but your your rest days or you're going to fuel different then you're you're high intensity workout days until you're like moderate and low intensity workout days\nAnd I think that just to say that there is different types of feelings were different workout days and different preparation or that you're actually have a low intensity or you're working on the power and you're working on some different energy system later on and you're fueling different\nTo put it very simply\nYou want high quality food right and I would also not struggle with things as taste terrible um 'cause that's not sustainable either right so you're just on ... ... ... the things that you like things that you enjoy eating\nUm a quantity like how much are you how much you really need right and then the times and the timing you're going to eat and you know even down to the timing like you know\nEating too close to dinner of you to bed time I'm Sorry I'm that could disrupt your sleep so we talk about all these things and how they how they work with each other but also for the corporate athlete that's out there I mean you think about your energy\nBut also for the corporate athlete that's out there I mean you think about your either your energy level during a guy and also hydration it's something very critical to their\nOwn election that will cause just for a second but I think I'm about mothers and families and and that kind of stress when as you said hydration but the quality of foods and one of the things that we bought was stressed is can you buy a little more local can you buy a little more\nOrganic you know because we have a soil that's been somewhat depleted\nDo we have the same nutrients in those fruits and vegetables and when we get back\nWill touch on to your your kind of approach to supplements I Know again I'm the high in protein spend been pretty been pretty common and then more so I Want to talk about taking\nYour mission you're motto\nKind of use simplifying this for us in that eats sweat and thrive and how alternately can we use that to the best of our ability as a little bit of a magic the licks are for healthy living right good wait\nA low stress good cardio and obviously high quality of life give us

environment of\nWhether it's a needing really good food a needing really good sleep\nOr supplements those types of things and outside help in in training and how we exercise how we use our body how we move how we stay flexible how we kind of ward off the end of the career may be an end to end of life issue So Adam I'm\nTelling me about this then so as I think about\nYour simplification and I like it a lot eat sweat and thrive and that I'm sure it can start very young as we think about families and kids all the way up to grandparents older generations\nSo tell us about how well maybe that can be ultimately that a little bit of that magic all except for us in healthy healthy living and in different stages of our lives do you place maybe different weight different emphasis on\nNutrition versus exercise versus cardio does it changed\nVersus exercise versus cardio does it change has changed as the science of keeping people healthy changed a lot since you started this company\nIt doesn't matter what age you know someone who's listening here is that you know when you think about nutrition and eating it I think about your energy management you should think you should be trying to be self aware Doris Day like it might sluggish why\nDo I feel good why um that I wake up that I have breakfast today so many people we work with don't eat breakfast so they don't drink water\nAnd it's such an important it's such an important part we're losing a leader to order every night and you're starting your day dehydrated I mean your reaction time is lower um you um it causes daytime fatigue the dehydration\nSo waking up in the morning eating breakfast you know things that are once again quality quickly timing um you know start moving find at times\nDon't set your don't set your ah your sweat sessions or your your conditioning for some time at five AM because if you're not a morning person I don't want you start the day like ... automatically not achieving your goals set it

movement\nAnd they're finding something that you enjoy doing getting up eating breakfast drinking water 'em and then ... ... a big part of that we didn't really talk about much as the thrive portion and that's like the the mental performance the stress management\nYou know the sleep component and I said that's really really critical to uh\nYou know the fleet component and I think that that's really really critical to\nThat manage to manage the distress in day in and day out find time to breathe every day we have a credible amount of resources on their tactical athletes world that has

people maybe it is not and that is about diet about food about what we consume about what we cook what else do we use you know what level of saturated fat as an example is acceptable\nAnd then of course what does that mean to us in terms of health and in terms of heart health and cardiovascular\nAnd to help us get through all of that is our guest Dr penny ... after ten and and it fits with some of the things that we've had a worldwide chat going on\nA blogger and some of the other social outlet some part of it has been the influence of other environmental\nImpacts on our day to day living on on our health one of them was an interesting piece that we posted in and go to court and exchange going about green space in urban centers about the the role the\nThe effect of air pollution on children as an example of great story\nJust came out about air pollution levels and how it is potentially a diminishing\nShould levels and how it is potentially um diminishing the edge of the\nAbility of our children on up kind of a short cognitive cognitive\nMemory so academic scholastic things like that uh level so all of those things kind of come together to day because we know there's a lot of environmental elements and that's the purity of the soil and water\nAnd other natural resources ecosystem one ecosystem of which we are part of but certainly we potentially have a little more control around nutrition around that side\nOf the equation and Dr penny Chris ethane after ten is a distinguished professor of nutrition\nAnd the department of nutritional sciences at the Pennsylvania State University she has served on several national committee's including the dietary guidelines for Americans and national academy's dietary reference intake for energy\nA macro nutrients and cholesterol and as a member of the American Heart Association nutrition committee she's coauthor numerous scientific statements and advisories that have made diet\nAnd lifestyle recommendations again maybe things we don't always want to deal with that we're not always ... about put recommendations for the prevention and treatment as an example of CBD she's a presently vice chair of the ha ha ha counsel on lifestyle and\nA cardio metabolic health\nAnd she is published over three hundred and thirty papers in the peer reviewed literature and has won numerous awards ... sake thank you so much for being with us today and I know one of the things we're going to touch on certainly\nIs a story we posted about the U.S groan saw soybean oil achieved and FDA quality\nUs rooms saw soybean oil achieved an FDA qualified heart health claim and what that means in kind of the role of the food and Drug Administration and how that is authorized the use of a qualified health clean and what does it mean to us\nBut I Want to start with your research research focuses on quote the effects of diet stab launched an emerging risk factors for cardiovascular disease let me ask you this this is this for people of all age groups\n[noise] well I thank you so much for having me here today I'm very excited to be here [noise] um yes I Do research in the area of cardiovascular nutrition and when you look at different\nDiets Hawkeye ran off her specific foods [noise] and we try and says well on\nThe risk factor for heart disease as a major one for like class time levels and direct pressure and men have within Miller an emerging risk factors like markets transformation\nUm we also you know and look at related factors\nTo heart disease and we look at how guy affects body composition and overweight and obesity and then even um gr customer and scratches her diabetes too\nAnd what's interesting Dr right so even personally going through let's say an annual physical I noticed that\nThe results are much more detailed where before it was a little more generic owned the levels of cholesterol now will break down all these different types of cholesterol and I'm not a scientist I don't know enough about it but are they are it is a kind of like small\nParticles are pieces and\nWell I'm particles are pieces and like the insight into the body to me is is pretty remarkable in unbelievably detail\nWhat do you specifically look at that in more of an aging population or is that across the board\nWhile we look at me like you know adults of all ages we don't really do research in children from my colleagues here at Penn State do [laughter] but um you know our\nAge range that we study is about two and Twenty one and we have people all the way up to age Seventy five\nAnd does that research include a look at kind of aging and disease in general as it relates to food and nutrition or is it much more specific to cardiovascular health\nWell they didn't have that to them for a good point and I'm very good question that you're asking about um what we found is and it's not so much age that plays a role in the diet response but\nIt's related to just give us the overall health so in general are overweight and obese people now don't respond quite as well\nTo a healthy diet compared to normal weight individuals and then also the other thing is people who have increased markers of information seemed to have a diminished diet\nResponse but you know some of these things tend to correlate with getting older so in the United states people have age related increases in body weight and then along with that you know come a increases in these markers of inflammation\nSo in essence yeah there are a part of it as an age factor here\nFor the nation so in essence yeah they're a part of an age factor here but it does relate a lot more to just the way a person is at a given time in terms of their body weight and their information status\nThen I'm Glad you mentioned inflammation week we seem to hear a lot more about it in a little bit later we're going to get into some different dietary recommendations obviously as you know there's some misinformation or miss understood elements of what is being suggested to us\nBut I don't know maybe it's me but I I I feel as though inflammation in I don't know if you're talking about markers as it relates to cardiovascular or even joined in inflammation which is so common um but it just seems as though that\nThat ah the impact that role is\nTalked about a lot more seems to be taking on more status is that true is inflammation ... a ... a very relevant part of what you're looking at\n'em and it absolutely is that right well\nYeah I like to think of information sort of as\nA range and so there's sort of a low grade inflammation\nSo that oh if you might have to say you know it's going to be something temporary but that does cause inflammation in front of her response than there is\n[noise] around the world infectious diseases like malaria banging shock as disease and the illness has spread bypass are causing a major health\nRestrict the most vulnerable many of them

renewable now at\nThe same ability [noise]\nSo you're saying but those are the doctor\nIs it to speak English professor in the department of\nNatural nutritional science at Pennsylvania\nState University and she's helping us sort through a couple of reasons stories we ran one is one of the subjects but\nBut also we're having a broader conversation about food about what we're eating about why we're eating about our heart cardiovascular and one of the points made early on which was really interesting Dr that you've touched on\nWhich I've been thinking a lot about I I like to try to work out every day and at certain days I'll go to the gym\nAnd there's people there that are generally fit that hey I Want to lose ten pounds or you know I Want to get rid of this before Christmas and it does seem as though they do it fairly quickly and maybe you know they have a little easier time keeping it\nDo they do it fairly quickly and maybe you know they have a little easier time keeping it often somebody who is a little more sedentary\nNot as fit but specifically because this may be caught my attention a big thing in particular\nThere was there was a subject that we touched on which I Believe came out of your office or something that you had developed and that was us grooms soybean oil achieves this FDA qualified heart health claim the food and Drug Administration authorized the use of a qualified health claim\nConfirming soybeans oils ability to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and soybean oil is the most widely used edible oil in the United states the most oil sold as vegetable oil are intact soybean oil\nSo this announcement this achievement this this health clean\n'em how is it significant\nWell um it's a very significant because it validates ... we do now\nAnd that is that I'm probably being oil can in fact reduce the risk of corner heart disease and um now people have to really follow what the climate is saying and so and not overdo town that may just redo the exact claim\nThat tests supportive but not cross of scientific evidence suggests that eating about wanting to have tablespoons down I mean I'll which contains saturated fat\nMay reduce the risk of corner disease\nTo achieve this possible benefit soybean oil to replace saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat and the day and that's the key you know don't just stop eating some you know and\nNot change anything else in your diet because well\nStart eating some you know and not change anything in your diet because that will definitely cause weight gain but what you want to do I want people want to do is to to be an oil for solid fats in their diet\n[noise] and so as you said it's very specific there's some disclaimer is this process than that the FDA goes through in order to issue that is it a long process\n[noise] well it can be um it is a very I think of rigorous process\nAnd so somebody has to submit an application or the kitchen and they have to review all of science\nAnd justify why I'm fat soybean oil is a healthy oil and\nMay reduce the risk of corner activities so that takes a while to put that petition together and then it does take a little while for the FDA to review it and he wrote gay or in a part of the crime\nAnd I'm guessing that that would be put forward by supporters of soybean oil maybe an association of of growers manufacturers distributors that type of thing\nThat to typically\nPut case because for yes\nOkay and I'm so in then in that situation the FDA as you said would go ... and then we have kind of this qualified but let me ask you this can you be more specific I'm just trying to think about\nIf I go ahead and follow this routine you made a very good point you know your substituting rivalries you're not adding calories which is so and sometimes forget yeah and I'm able to get to a level did you\nTo show that we sometimes forget yeah and I'm able to get to a level did you say two tablespoons and a half per\nDay yes wandering tablespoons of de\n... exactly would that help my cardiovascular performance\nExcellent that's the question it will lower your LDL cholesterol and to recall the earlier I said that they all cost shop is a major and in fact cause of risk factor for heart disease out of this oil is going to help lower that bad cholesterol\nAnd it's very interesting too because again thinking of my own situation and I've been really lucky where my journal cholesterol has been very low but one thing that can be really hard and I hope you don't mind touching on this or certainly in my keys has been difficult and I really do try to follow a pretty\nRigid rigorous\nFor room around nutrition and take some supplements insured any\nExercise but it's hard it it seems to raise your age deal\nYou're absolutely right it is that\nRight [noise] well um it's\nJust you know biologically it just doesn't move much now there are certain things you can do a eat a healthy diet that helps\nUm eat good fat and stay away from you know those refined carbs that I'll bump that can bump it up a little bit of a physical activity works but again we're not talking about increasing it a lot are talking about bumping it up you know\nA few several points and then the other thing as as well now I I just said this carefully and in moderation but alcohol has been shown to increase they feel that they say that I Hope everybody doesn't go out and just start\nBut beyond that it's a ... and people have been studying coffee now showing some house forever\nAnd one of the things that's funny I was talking with a nutritionist stone I was known in Nashville, Tennessee really smart guy and we're going to you and I going to touch on\nSome of the things that he believes in include including a which generally referred to as a as a paleo diet although I Know that's ... ... a little bit and ... into some other variations\nOf but he said well listen coffee is you just said in moderation maybe one or two a day said what makes it bad news to add sugar and cream theory in sugar to it\nMhm that's right\nDiet plan which as you know is very big on proteins so certainly very big on\nAs you know is very big on proteins to certainly very big on meat you talked about fruit before and one of the things that does is a radical the most of the fruits because of the sugar so if you're going to do any fruit\nYou would do it more as a desert and it would be as low sugar as possible might be certain berries as an example and it really\nPretty much a rabbit cage rains carbon so for that fit in with your understanding of nutrition and ... and what you have learned even recently to some of these changes with the FDA\nYeah we currently have food based\nRecommendation that have been made by the department of health and Human Services and U.S Department of agriculture and these are our\nDietary guidelines and they to guide all eating behavior and purchasing decisions are they are used by legislatures as well you know for food stamp programs and programs [noise] and so they are truly a holy grail\nAnd planning menus in schools right after\nThe or get into those doctor but also the into us but they must change vacillate alive right to\n[noise] well\nI guess it depends upon how you look at them you know some of our core recommendation have been the same for many years and that is eat fruits and vegetables and actually dairy products and whole grains are all recommended [noise] um\nBut you have a very just a little bit in terms of now with these ... struck Monday and we actually have a number of servings and serving sizes defined\nWe actually have a number of servings\nAnd serving sizes defined for a lot of different calorie level of for both men and women and the United states [noise] but [noise] you know I think the key message here is that where these guidelines they recommend\nNow is that a number of servings from all food groups and that's the problem that I have on the patio that even though there's an emphasis on veggies and a fish seafood poetry a lean meats\nKnow they they eliminate grain products and they eliminate dairy products and also they like him which are so good\nAnd they eliminate a lot of the fruit but so are they wrong to as an example try to the cutting neurotic heat a lot of the sugars as an example or potentially the dairy why why would they put most of the Dario\n[noise] well it's an issue that deals with the sugars so this is a real real low carb diet and it's you know basically higher protein low carb diet so yeah you would have to\nYou'd have to eliminate or take out any foods that contribute in some carbohydrate like dairy like him even peanuts they're like yeah they do contain some car and of course ... even if their\nWhole grain high fiber cereals can have you done this time\nIt would take a mostly arises right yeah and the multi grain breads and things like that and but the I guess the question is miss would you would you agree\nBut the I guess the\nQuestion is miss would you would you agree or disagree it's always if you could follow this because in essence it's almost a state of doses right the German huh that you're getting two for your body and\nI guess that's not done to excess but but it's done properly that might be one of the best bet\nBurning conditions you can be in particularly as you get rid of all the sugars does does that make sense to you the danger of that\nOn the short term basis yes there's a lot of evidence that that's what's happening but then what I worry about is if people follow this way long term one or the health consequences and that hasn't been tested\nI often worry about people home yo yo back and forth on this diet plan and ... over you know they can do this over a period of ten years or more going on the patio and then off of it and back and forth and back and forth and\nThen I Wonder what the health consequences are of that\nAnd when I first heard about it it reminded me a bit and I didn't I never did I did research it a lot but I remember Dr Atkins being very popular yeah while and he was promoting a lot of the same tone foundational principles I think\nYou are right Amos promoting you know a very high protein low carb diet and his diet when it's real high in fat and high and saturated fat\nAnd that would you kind of\nCaution against as you think about heart disease cardiovascular health\nAbsolutely we know that saturated fat increases Elvie out of class draw and that's again a cause of factor for after ...\nIncrease for out of class straw and Africa cause a factor for after ...\nAnd so ... perhaps than a diet like this is an example could be very good as you said in the short term let's say you're building a lot of muscle and there does seem to be a heavy emphasis on putting more proteins into our bodies at this point would you agree with that\nI'm kind of recommendation that we might want to put more protein in our bodies\nWell at the expense of that car first round out about that whatsoever and then ...\nAge after I should probably be in front of our ... maybe the elderly and especially ... when they don't get getting that might not getting the amount of practice and they pay dreamy pow population she never ran\nOut of pocket women and might be good to have a higher ... and\nAnd and again on a temporary basis maybe you're it's fat reduction or muscle building maybe you're getting into routine to run a marathon or something that would peak kind of peak demand that might be a good a good week one of the things Dr we worry about here\nAre really environmental conditions and again we just posted it on the air quality and the impact on kids cognitive certainly memory short term memory ability\nIs is potentially impacted\nBut we've reported in talks a lot to soil specialists and restoration specialist about soil and it being stripped of its nutrients when you think about our food supply and what the dietary recommendations are do you worry at all that we're not going to get it because the quality of the food is not as good\n[noise] there are a lot of things\nOnly the food is not as good\n[noise] well there are a lot of things that contribute to the nutrient density of vitamins\nAnd minerals and food and yes growing conditions can play a role like you're saying but then also um you know just storage conditions may amount of time that the food takes to\nGet from the farm to the retail market those are all contributing factors and then beyond that how a person cooks the food\nAnd so somebody could just really over cook certain fruits and vegetables and destroy or get rid of a lot of vitamins and minerals just by how they cook the food\nSo many many factors contributes to the new trend quality of the foods we eat\nAnd processing potentially yeah absolutely yeah what about contaminants what about the things that might be in our water supply or grounds and\nIs that\nBecoming more of a risk factor do you look at that in terms of overall look them in donations for good hope the cardiovascular systems [noise] well\nIs an issue that we have to be

for about six years for that um I was working\nAh I worked at a bunch of different colleges and universities are for ten years before that are all sorts of different jobs in college administration residents white student activities I managed to campus pub at one point [laughter]\nCollege administration residents life student activities I managed to campus police at one point so just about anything you could imagine um I I did it um my job at Bristol includes helping students with the enrollment process the application are going to college fairs answering questions I'm\nI was talking to a a an admissions counselor from another school yesterday\nOr about how fortunate I Am one of the benefits of my job as I get to go out into the community a lot more than other rocks from other schools um to do more educational stuff like that so yeah absolutely an added bonus Rob is actually my admissions counselor\nShows how long ago [laughter] a a micro\nGavin I'm financially ... ah I've been there for about two years before that um I was in uh the trio programs which are community based programs that help with a\nAdmissions financial aid the college process for first generation students um my role at the colleges I decide for canceling students on the financial aid process um I also do financial literacy or programs\nFor a all campuses as well as default prevention um programs\nAwesome you mentioned first generation Rob you're actually doing an event to write were first generation families yes thank you [laughter] uh yeah tomorrow night or on a October Eighteenth at six thirty PM at ... high school um\nWe're doing an event or to educate it's targeted it's a first generation primer so it's it specific to it's it's pretty much taking college and breaking it down to the\nSimplest terms for folks that are for students whose family has never sent anyone college before\nUh for students whose family has never sent anyone college before I'm In an attempt to demystify the whole process\nUm it's part of a larger college planning series that we've been doing this year um that we are continuing through the spring semester or in collaboration with Bridgewater State University um Alvaro bishops being north outer borough and north in high schools um\nUh doing different sessions to get folks more involved in the different aspects of the process um so uh it's un bury auditorium tomorrow night if anyone wants to stop by and get more information\nThere will come to do that awesome cool and that's the goal of this segment I guess was the same kind of stuff you're talking about now just to give advice to families first generation families or even families in general that\nAre so so there there are tons of opportunities to learn about all the different schools um once you've expose yourself to those schools and know what you're looking for\nA then you can that that will get you down to what school you you all Timothy ... yeah yeah I I Know for me to it might be just be the nerdy me but I used to always look up the faculty there and kind of like what their background was are there resources have done because\nThe faculty there and it's kind of like what their background was or their research that they've done because if there is research in the same stuff I'm interested in my I'm going to like this and that same thing when I I was a tour guide for a little bit during my undergrad\nSo I always like you know our teachers of their lawyers or this or that they've done this and I feel like that kinda helps students gauging or interest in it too\nThat's who I'm Mike how did you ultimately decide what school you wanted to go to\nUm I I Am that they had a special program that I that I was interested in a that was something it was I'm a little bit more of a financial burden that I Wish now that I'm\nPaying [laughter] scare everyone away with it [laughter] I I don't mean to do that but you know on\nUm you know how do you pick a school it's also good to ah when you're looking at schools to talk with your family and and analyze your available funds and resources and how\nUm you plan on on and funding your education uh because a\nFar too often I I've I've had people who had this perfect idea this perfect school\nUm and the funds were there and and they had to come to the realization that it it\nJust was just wasn't doable again not trying to scare people away just\nA want you to ah to be aware but are ultimately as they had a special program um that are\nNo other schools had gotcha so that's that's why we're\nCool Rob is they're up there are specific websites to write what people can search my major in our down isn't there some once or twice\nYeah they're um I mean the the\nApplication website so the common application is is one way to apply to colleges are about I think five hundred schools across the country subscribe to the common application where you go you fill out\nI think five hundred schools across the country subscribe to the common application where you go you fill out one application and that goes to whatever school to pick on on the coming up I'm so that has application of its ... information about its members schools\nI'm a\nCollege Board um has information about different colleges and universities um there are some other search engines that are specific to colleges and universities um it also doesn't or to look up specific schools or specific programs\nThat being said or\nGoogle gets advertising money [laughter] from him colleges and universities so I'm a good so it's an added a perspective that I have is my oldest daughter is going through this process now I'm also a parent um [noise] and uh a couple\nOf years ago she was considering going into forensic science and so she looked up forensic science programs yeah and you know University of Tampa Syracuse University and a couple of others and and\nSo okay that's that's one way to start the search yeah um do you really think you want to be in Tampa yeah you really think you want to and then driving up to the\nMid west one summer we stopped for lunch in Syracuse and I spoke to us the car ride so far so long I said\nWell we're about forty five minutes away from Syracuse University [laughter] and she said oh yeah this is the limit of how far I Want to go [laughter] so now we've got a radius so ... ... um uh so\nSo there's ... there's a few different ways to go about it yeah\nCool and uh let's say someone finally decides they want to attend a in one thing the school's always mentioned to the SATs\nDoes everyone have to take this or is it you know some schools and you don't have to uh how should someone determine whether or not if they want to take their SATs or they should or shouldn't they should look at what the school requires every every college\nShould they should look at what the school requires every every college and university has different requirements related to the application process in terms of minimum high school GPA\nOr whether or not they require SAT or a C. T. or both or whether they're touched optional which means you can a wave the test requirement from your application ... typically in that case they the colleges are universities wanted to see a higher GPA I'm\nA so there's there's a number of different\nOr was there\nA number of different criteria that colleges will look at 'em some will require an interview some will or will be explicit in terms of scoring or a resume of activities or extra curricular co curricular activities [noise] um\nSo it the important and then there are schools like like Bristol we don't require college I say we don't require SATs or ACTs um if you uh did well on the reading and writing portion of your SAT than we can wave part of our placement tests for you\nSo there is still benefit to taking them but they're not required or so the important thing is once you've decided a on a school or your narrative down to a few schools making sure you fully understand what their requirements\nAre and that you're meeting the the deadlines for the application\nGotcha deadlines are important especially when it when you're transferring or anything like that absolutely her um\nWell so let's say you're in school maybe don't have the highest GPA or you have options for ya you doomed like what can somewhat a low GPA do a thing that they they still want to go to college though are you you're definitely not doomed um for for schools that have a minimum GPA requirements\nOr or some combination of GPA\nPA requirements or or some combination of GPA an SAT score requirements a student that as a low GPA\nBut uh did exceptionally well on SATs may still be considered by a by a college or university that has a minimum GPA requirement\nI'm a British still doesn't look at GPA or or at all for any of our programs um for some of our selective health programs we we may look at specific grades in math or chemistry\nOr for in terms of our health science programs like nursing or dental hygiene but beyond that um we're we're not looking at your GPA were ... as long as you're sending us a transcript that verified you've completed your high school requirements we can we can admit you into the into\nOr just about any of our programs awesome awesome\nAlready folks were in the studio with a representative from birds to community college talking about the admissions process how to apply how do you know you're ready to apply a different tips in advice for a first generation families or just any family in general I'm In that college process\nAnd I'm also going to discuss financial aid options for families or how to apply a different scholarships grants and loans what the differences and what not to look out for your feeling so stick around we'll we'll learn a little bit more after these messages\nHi my name is Chris Wyoming and I'm the manager of the elder dental program where in lighting any seniors residing in Massachusetts who are sixteen older\nSo they can ... dental screening clinic and titan on Saturday October Tanya from a forty five AM to one plan protected pencil receive afraid that they'll screening and have an opportunity to speak that identity and the clinics relaxed and finally setting I tend to be screened for oral cancer and\nHave a chance to receive free that checking\nFor more information\nCats aren't and have a chance to receive free that checking\nFor more information called seven seven four zero three one three kick the free dental screening connect and organized by the ... that's a program a project at the community will all\nRich is just a really really good guy\nThe term good egg isn't enough to describe but he's also certified organic and free range rich puts the cat back done everything the toothpaste the olive oil the sham poo everything\nHe lets his ten year old nephew beat him in virtual tennis even though he can straight up sleigh ten year old nephew [noise] when the toilet paper is running low rich replaces the rules on the actual holder not just on the back of the toilet reaches\nTexting and driving rich you know what do you do in rich [noise]\nI was just telling everyone how great you are texting and driving\nMakes good people look bad\nVisit stopped tech stop ... dot org a public service announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nMental health or just like physical health is an important part of every person's overall wellbeing learn about the many issues surrounding mental health by listening to our new show exploring mental illness everything you wanted to know but we're too afraid to ask\nOn Mondays at six PM on W.

aid\nSo some of the community college guy friend admissions process and we're going to say went to the financially\nUm portion of the interview or a raw before we wrap up if you can give a tip to a a high school junior or senior thinking about college or maybe first generation that families are have been to college what would you tell that person if you could give them one\nPiece of advice I'm like I said before it was also\nIn my opinion I think it's going to the financial aid counselor is extremely helpful through that entire process I'm angry\n[laughter] and you're insuring\nYourself that's getting done the right way to you know you don't have to worry about it um but there are different types of\nA financial opportunities right so we have scholarships grants and loans or did you explain a little bit what each is in how they differentiate from one another and kind of uh what are some things that family could say All right we're going to choose this loan or will pick the scholarship or whatnot\nWhat are some things that family could Sarah we're going to choose this loan or will pick the scholarship or whatnot okay\nSo I grants grants and scholarships are free money those money that you never have to pay back it just given to go to school grants come primarily from either the federal state government or or is this school themselves\nUm you never have to pay back scholarships can come from a either the school or I knew or is outside institutions there are millions of scholarships for almost anything you can think of\nUm [noise] I was cautious often they're separate application to the FAFSA\nUm or CSS Profile for private and a private institutions um and usually they require some sort of essay or or I work but they can be tailored to a hobby you have a field of study that you're going into anything like that\nUh and then there's some great resources out there to search for those um [noise] I Would recommend if you're interested in scholarships are starting a ... a year before like with the FAFSA\nUm 'cause far too often students have come to me in the summer\nI'm looking for scholarships for the following school year and uh they're they're just they're all gone um if I can plug one source I Would say fast Web dot com or is it good resource for our looking up scholarships you create a profile\n'em and they'll show you um some scholarships that they think we'd be tailored towards you are as well as um email you wind scholarships come up that would fit the or your your profile\n... and so the fast food strictly\nYour profile I'm ... and so the fast food strictly junior loans correct no the FAFSA is for loans grants and scholarships sorry I forgot the loan\nPeace [laughter] how long did you have to pay back um there are multiple\nKinds of loans are the two primary loans they eye you will see are the direct Stafford loans um and those are there are annual limits to those based on your a dependency status and uh and um\n[noise] uh enrollment level and are those are kind of broken up into two categories I'm not sure how indebted to you want me to get on this\nOr do you think the more the better I think for sure I direct loans directly ... broken up into a subsidized non subsidized\nWhat that means is that for these subsidized loans the government pays the interest for you while you're in school or which is a great benefit and ends up saving you are lots of money\nI'm On subsidized loans or interest is occurring all you're in school and is then capitalized um whenever you graduate or drop below halftime enrollment ah\nAh students can make interest payments while they're old if they want to keep that down or if not um you know that's that's fine too they're not required to do so [noise] um for a more expensive institutions are also plus loans PLUS Loan\nOr is at the undergraduate level is alone than a parent would take out\nUm to help the student pay 'em you know pay for the cost of attendance or in a a graduate school the students themselves can take out a plus loan and then there's private loans or I Would always recommend federal loans over private loans um they\nUh I Would always recommend federal loans over private loans um they uh have tend to have lower interest rates they ah with the direct loans they're not credit based so even if you have credit problems\nThat doesn't matter you can still get those loans and I'm\nA they have excellent um benefits that help you pay off if you get into trouble there are different programs that you can get into to help you pay off your loans in
