afternoon\nTendency for the sun now to start to fade behind those clouds and by late afternoon\nI few raindrops here and they're not much impact tonight or again if you areas of light rain falling back to the mid fifties again as much of the night it won't be raining\nAnd then tomorrow increasing sunshine mixed with clouds eyes in the mid sixties better chance of showers tomorrow night that would be the more concentration of the showers and if we can get it at night that would be a good thing back to the sun and clouds on Wednesday\nEyes in the upper sixties and warmest afternoon of the week looking Thursday Lowe in mid seventies even early a touch of humidity or late touched depending on your point of view do points could get briefly into the low sixties Thursday then it's back to cooler weather for friday mostly sunny\nEyes and the low sixties and right now the weekend looks essentially dry it'll be a couple of weeks fronts over the next week to ten days but most of them will be fairly minor in fact as I said earlier the one tomorrow night probably\nAre bringing the most in the way of rain and even that is not a big deal low tide next coming up shortly it or just after eight o'clock the high tide of south coast around two o'clock this afternoon and once again the foliage now a little delayed because of the weather over the last few weeks of being warmer than average\nBut once it gets going as long as we don't have any real bad when storms\nAh although delayed should be quite colorful\nYou don't have any real bad when storms ah although delayed should be quite colorful over the coming weeks\nYeah is this shit as you said a lot of places like up north probably will not see some of that foliage until ah possibly ah probably another month from now\nYeah well a peak in terms of their you still see the glimpses of it now even around here but in terms of peaking as we always talk about the um the first peak really this to waves of the ... the early maples those the ones with the reds and the bright orange is and then you have the deeper ruins as we get into early in the early to mid November the\nOld trees those the ones where everything is that were ruined color and some of the yellow he asked trees and things like that so there's really two peaks of the color\nAnd again even some of the a maple trees around the area that still haven't completely lost all the leaves or not full\nAnd color and many of them are though they are delayed as well so if anything it's just a gives you more chance to see the colors as we go even into early November that's why I get I'm joking about uh the colors are quite colorful around Halloween more ways than one\nYeah I Know that uh you know I Know a lot of times when I was a kid going up to my first time going up to a a New Hampshire and Vermont\nWas a I think it was like Nineteen Seventy a we had going up and boy I tell you it was a beautiful back then 'cause it was a Columbus Day weekend and those three days that we were up there Friday Saturday it's actually Saturday Sunday Monday we went up there\nAnd I was when the ten years old eleven years old and I still remember just like it was yesterday that going up there and we've gone to the old man of the mountain and my sister who is three years younger than me did not want to have her picture taken with a sign behind her so she started\nCrying she's I don't want to but we she didn't bother to show somebody was actually there taking\nUh you know in other tourists are so my sister\nKnow pictures uh you know to another tourists\nAre so my sister did not get into that picture out it was my mom myself and my dad grew in that picture\nMy my sister was on the on the other side you know like ... to this day I you know I kinda bus represent you remember that kind you remember everything you even remember I was crying because I wouldn't even go up there and yes I Do\nGo what does that she was afraid of the old man that would have just like to have her picture taken\nAll the pictures yeah yeah of course yeah just the last ten or Fifteen Years that that fell off a number of broken out right there are now but it's you know what an agenda ... I'll end on this one to get back to the music and everything ah when you go up north the Foley is not only\nReally it's it's nice to see and it's similar to here but the fact that you're up in the mountains so you sometimes have good vistas of seeing the colors from up up up up above looking down into valleys and things like that you don't get as much around here\nBecause the ... it's fairly flat for the most part so you're looking just that something may be across the street but when you get up into the elite to rain mhm uh you can see that and that's why even parts of southern Chester county as I show you know some of the hills\nThere and even when I Lived in Bellingham we used to go up the men didn't area some of the hill Joe's rock and rent them you can go up there and look around and see the foliage a you know from a high courage and it looks you have what color to see when you were up in the mountainous terrain that's why people have always asked\nYou know ... what is it about northern New England well it's a similar color to here it's just that you have better vistas up on top of hills mountains to see it more than anything else so\nBut there are still you know as you know northern Rhode Island the hills of north Smithfield in places like that and again I I Would anticipate probably in about two to three weeks just before\nWe get closer to Halloween we're going to have some really good splashes of color again outside of any bad storm blowing the leaves off the tree so again are really the\nOutside of any that storm blowing the leaves off the tree so again the really the only the threat of rain of of of any consequence this week really is tomorrow night the stuff we get later today tonight will be fairly light and not much of a consequence over well what else was new was stuck a month of October nope it whether\nThat's right that's for sure of another update next oh\nOkay All right so ah yeah you've got some decent color or right around the corner from me as I said right outside of needle techno babble borough but indeed in their industrial park or there was one tree that is right there on the corner\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to W.

M. A. O. before you get one for bum gay\nOkay so I guess we've established ... is not a dirty word okay I won't even tell you what image it puts in my mind but uh how about Lizzy running for president ... yeah [noise]\nYeah in Holyoke, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said oh once November six comes and she is reelected percent it\nYou know the job she's way wicked good at the job she should stay at a then she will strongly consider running for president of the United states of America I'm with the fifty eight percent fifty eight percent of Elizabeth Warren supporters in Massachusetts\nWho think that's a really bad idea as that's a terrible idea I Love Elizabeth Warren I Love everything she uh writes about speaks about stands for everything she has stood for her entire life\nUm but she could never ever be elected president of the United states unfortunately\nBut she could never ever be elected president of the United states unfortunately one she's a woman and not a drop dead gorgeous woman are the only force in our culture that still stronger than racism is massage any\nUm\nAnd let's think let's think Trump's president because the only possible candidate he could have beaten\nHillary Clinton was his opponent\n... I Know I Know let's put up another woman for president who's too smart for most people who sounds really really shrill when she speaks loudly who sounds like a no it all grandmother that nobody could stand even though she's brilliant and perfect for the job\nOr yeah yeah let's do that it's amazing uh I'm a busy coming in and they were playing some clips of people are and this one guy I couldn't believe it no I uh I I voted\nFor Trump because because I was a Bernie supporter and I couldn't vote for Hillary and I vote for Trump again if if uh if if Liz he ran against\nHim so Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who were pretty soon ... when it comes to policy views and such\nUm you you were Bernie supporter\nBut your typical you know uninformed male enough where you can't possibly vote for a non good looking woman so you'd vote for Trump or lives a year incredibly popular in Massachusetts incredibly popular not selling the rest of the country\nI'm Lizzy me personally I Love you you would be out of your mind to run for the presidency my God and and Jeff deal who I have nothing good to say about I mean can you imagine he was like the co chair of Trump's a election committee in Massachusetts\nWow a how badly did your parents screw up raising you\nWhen you grow up\nHow badly did your parents screw up raising you when you grow up to be the co chair of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts I mean wow I made some mistakes as a parent never mistake that big when my kid grow up to be\nNot just a Trump supporter but the head of his campaign in this state wow but Jeff deal is absolutely right when he says oh see I told you\nI told you she's not interested in being your senator she wants to be your president if she wants to be president the president or run for president\nDon't waste your time running for the Senate your backup position I I just uh Lizzy I think your timing was poor or I think Elizabeth I think I think Elizabeth Warren would be a wonderful president sure as hell a breath of fresh air after this train wreck in the White House unfortunately uh there was no way on God's green earth she could win ever\nEver she can be senator in Massachusetts state full of smart people as long as she wants [noise]\nUm but I don't think she could ever be president because you've got to appeal to millions and millions and millions of really stupid people to be president and Elizabeth Warren could live for a thousand years\nAnd never appealed to a single stupid person Elizabeth I love you you running for president is a terrible idea I Wish it was it I really wish it wasn't but I think it is a five a way to to to one three to zero five a way to to to Thirteen twenty\nOh thank you Asian eighty two rights according to the Urban

couple of more and more correspondence it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine four\nIn ages Seventy writes holy crap you met JD Salinger wow yeah we did I didn't know it until after the meeting was over but just just a nice guy\nAnd again we just talked about normal nice guy things but yeah agents seven and that is kind of a neat memory I kinda like that and I and again I really really are the way Sally handled that I thought was so classy and so polite\nAnd uh so wise you know he was just out there as a as a man painting and we were just three people crossing paths enjoying the day\nHe didn't want to be treated like a celebrity so Sally didn't treat him like a celebrity that was classy I thought but then again she was always so much last year than I was a ... agent thirty one yeah\nYou're absolutely right age and thirty one if she Elizabeth Warren is not planning on serving a full term as Massachusetts senator she should not run what would want to expect from a super delegate oh God there it is super delegates\nAnd why was Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee for president the only candidate that Donald Trump could have possibly beating because of superdelegates said it before we get in you know unfortunately we get in arguments back and forth we're not going to do it today above him there were lots of reasons he's president lots of reasons\n\n[noise] Brian Song boy oh boy oh boy did that hit me right in the teeth oh gosh Asian Seventy following up on agent to twenty fours remote correspondence lord of the flies is a shining

the west or radio days I used to call myself a libertarian socialist [noise] yeah and I do have some libertarian ideals um I think there's a lot of ... major parts of our private lives were adults should be allowed to make\nAdult decisions without import oriented parents from the government but you're absolutely right um I often think of that with anarchists as well especially like uh the best example of this [noise]\nWho am I to say what the best example is a good example of this is a new movie the Big Lebowski oh wait oh we're very late art have got to get to this break in the movie the Big Lebowski\nUm the skinny little ... who run around dressed in black white awhile anarchists denial is where black anyway a these are the skinny little obnoxious guys are promoting anarchy a who\nGuys are promoting anarchy or who failed to realize you understand in in a pure Iraqi you guys are the first one to get us not beaten out if you get that I mean pure anarchy\nEven more than capitalism the bullies when pure libertarianism with no rules with no ah monitors\nThe bullies when and you're right if there's a that's one of the problems with capitalism is ah Winston Churchill said capitalism is the worst of all economic systems with the exception of all the others 'cause bullies when in capitalism a lot you want a system\nWhere even more bullies when then with capitalism yeah try libertarianism or anarchy that's two outstanding remote correspondence that three today I aged Seventy thank you\nUm [noise] oh good\nOh thank you I'm a gal that you know we have a guest

I said to him Senator Flake\nViewed that just a few days ago I stood in front of your office and for the first time shared my story of sexual assault [noise] um I did it because they recognize myself

Debbie Ramirez says he'll classmate who says he pushed his genitals and her face his naked generals she has been contacted\nI think we're seeing a lot of conflicting reports but it's very troubling what's emerging what we saw on Friday after the elevator confrontation was thought agreement between Democrats or Republicans that there would be actual due diligence that there would be an investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and that would of course include\nInterviewing the witnesses Dr Ford um and the other two women um it would also include interviewing people who\nAre whose evidence who's testimony could support them or not support that it would also include\nInterviewing Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI what we're hearing is that ah the White House counsel McGahn has somehow put limits on who the FBI can interview and made it very a very small number of people that's ridiculous that's absurd that's not the way these\nSomeone's background ... proceeding is not a real investigation\nThat's absurd that's not the way these supplemental backward investigations proceed and it's not a real investigation\nIf it turns out that that's what's happened that they've tried to whitewash this by interviewing only a couple of people a justice will not be served and this will be basically a whitewash I'm Senator Feinstein has requested more information about the scope of the interviews but quite frankly\nI'm I don't even think we should be having that sort of debate what happened on friday was a recognition\nThat more needs to be known about Brett Kavanaugh before he was given this sort of lifetime position I think there's ample evidence that he lied I think he lied\nIn his testimony on Thursday um but you know the FBI should not be constrained by whatever limits the White House wants to impose because the White House wants to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court in fact at the White House had its way he'd be on that he'd be confirmed today\nLisa you said that we shouldn't be talking about ... sauce denial she said he lied on Thursday judge Kavanaugh lied on Thursday under oath explain\nI think that there will two parts of that one is you know the the the conversation nationally in some parts has been on this notion that women make false accusations it's exceedingly rare\nThe actual probability in our country or just based on history or in recent history in particular as well is that when men are accused of attempted rape of rape of sexual harassment they deny it they falsely deny it that's the norm that's what usually happens sometimes they fall asleep at night with anger\nSometimes they fall asleep deny it through lawyers um but that's usually what happens women or come forward bravely tell their stories and men deny it and that's what we saw on friday I'm\nA that this the statement of Brett Kavanaugh was appalling the idea that he would attack those senators for daring to investigate a credible allegation of of attempted rape is absurd and in fact it's more than a credible allegation\nAllegation of of attempted rape is absurd and in fact it's more than a credible allegation what we saw was compelling consistent eye witness testimony from Dr Ford that should be fully credited\nWhat Brett Kavanaugh for was anger anger isn't evidence of innocence is certainly not evidence that we're ... the consistent and compelling testimony of Dr Ford and in fact what you saw Brett Kavanaugh do was the symbol yet again about his history\nAbout his drinking history about his ... book about even the statements of people who\nHave been asked about the incident claiming that they the other people who she says was there were there didn't denied it\nIn fact most of them said they didn't remember it which is fully consistent with her statement it wasn't significant for them it was significant for her um but that's not the only time in which Brett Kavanaugh allied he I I Believe lied in his earlier testimony\nIn ... in two thousand four and two thousand six and earlier this month about a number of matters including his role\nIn receiving stolen confidential information information was stolen from the United States Senate\nAbout judicial nominations and lying about his role in those judicial nominations I think that this man Brett Kavanaugh tells lies big and small he's unfit for the bench he's certainly unfit to be honest the Supreme Court and I've called for him to be impeached not\nPromoted but actually impeached so you're saying you're talking about him teach right now I'm from a federal court judge\nWhat I'm saying is that is that I think that that should be the conversation I think that there is ample evidence for the house to begin an investigation or an impeachment would begin in the house not the Senate that's the procedure on our constitution I don't know how long that sort of inquiry would take\nBut they're certainly ample evidence that Brett Kavanaugh has been on truthful to the Senate that he lied under oath that he misled the Senate every single time\nSpoke to the Senate that he was lied under oath that he's misled the Senate every single time he testified he has testified falsely in my view his statements have been contradicted by evidence in two thousand for two thousand six earlier this month in ... in twenty eight team and just this past week\nAnd I want to get to those issues that you raised before you were a top aide to Senator Leahy when you're talking about\nUh you believe Brett Kavanaugh um ultimately when he was brought before

always this program called we have to talk and there's something we really need to talk about today it's the ballot initiative that's coming up on the November ballot um and it's a really important one and it gets really confusing\nSo therefore I have a guest who's going to help me on pack the right and wrong of this and\nWhat the heck is going on with nurse staffing and why is it\nSo controversy not controversial but why why have you gotten so consider cutting I'm confused\nSo this is a Joan Valentine\nAnd I want to welcome you thank you and you are from Mansfield and you're working in brought in Norwood ed Norwood yeah tang they used to work she did she worked in obstetrics oh many many years I've been there for twenty two years\nUh-huh mhm and you'll love it love it I work in the icy you there I see this\nIs my passion yeah yeah [noise]\nSo where did you do when you're training in Glasgow in Scotland okay too many years ago I being a nurse for ... something years so clearly I started when I was tired and when you were [laughter]\nAbout Glasgow is a is a beautiful\n[laughter] but Glasgow is a is a beautiful place to go and is\nIt is but it's this is beautiful here my husband and I came here for my husband's work [noise]\nAnd we came off the plane and and we did a tour we did a to see the the leaves and sent out Vermont and mean and I said oh this is lovely yeah your fell in love with all due area to be really did and we took we there was three job offers and and I said no this is it it has the seasons as warm cold is it just\nLike [laughter] I'm so glad you're happy and I'm so glad you that you're here today so tell me about this ballot initiative in what's going on\nAll right well [noise] I'm a bedside nurse ... nurse and we're pushing forward about ... safe patient CARE Act\nSo it's called is safe patient CARE Act and you would like people to vote yes one on one okay so that's if you get nothing else out there it's please remember yes on one because the other side is trying to consider the issue and sound like they are\nVery virtuous but they're not\nWell they're even making their science to it very much like cars so it is confusing for the public but our ballot initiative will limit the number of patients to any one hour and can take care of any one time currently in Massachusetts the only area within a hostile that had limits just not as the ice you\nOwe and so the rest of the host of there are no limits there are no limits nurses can take in med search for anywhere from I think six to eight patients there is no limit [noise] if you got too many it is far too many\nYou don't have a chance to get a you know I'm I'm Talking about my sister is an hour and and she just\nMhm you don't have a chance to get a you know I'm I'm Talking about my sister is in Iran and she doesn't she's a yes on on one on definitely and actually she was a conservative Republican but I mean it did just that we cannot let her know that it was ... it 'cause everyone needs to nurse everyone needs and interests and and um\nI was telling you a little bit earlier I'm going into an E R\nWell maybe I'll tell you which hospital was what it was nearby um and um my husband had a fall and my husband has Parkinson's disease and he had a fall we're all from walk\nHe broke he landed here and um what happened was all of these people came rushing they stopped into energy and you can often help it with just the most amazing experience me as a caregiver seeing people just this heartfelt Jamie Ross\nAnd so finally have emergency withdraw the merchants of your calls came the ambulance and they took him to ...\nThey took him to the hospital and um\nWe walked in the door you know the two\nGuys went on either side of the stretcher and everybody walked by is nobody greeted us nobody said anything to us\nAnd you know in the ... yeah I was busy but you know what\nYou need enough staff there mhm\nMhm that's why you have staff when I see you because it's intense there nobody came over and comfort at him and said you're going to be okay\nYou know which is what do you need is I mean I was saying it to him but he's from someone who needs to hear you know so they could hand and say you're OK I'm the guy is Seventy three years old\nYou know that's why I'm here today to do this this is not my comfort zone but I Am so empowered an impassioned by this ballot initiative we have to get this passed we have to get it passed for patients in Massachusetts because you and I know everyone\nAnd we have to get it passed for patients in Massachusetts because you and I know everyone will need nurses sometime everyone needs a nurse and there has to be enough nurses so that we can safely take care of our patients\nThey don't immediately treat them no I mean because\nThey are not a very I tell you my husband didn't get treatments and you know what a former nurse and I know how to get good care you have to be fully present for that person and if you've got seven all those things on your mind that you have to do in the next twenty minutes right you're not fully present\nRight and the other let me just that the other part of the year 'cause I Know a lot of nurses are confused by our ballot they think it will affect and\nDrug Control but it will they won't so the other parts of the is there will be more nurses but\nAlso there'll be more nurses on the floor because a lot of times the gym in the ER is you cannot get the ER nurses an e are patients out to the floor so so if you increase the number of patients and nurses on the floor then\nAre not ending slowly forty eight hours and\nOn the floor and people are not ... ending flow thirty eight hours in the ER\nRight and and you cannot get good care for forty hours sitting in the air and they do not have the facilities to take care of an inpatient in the year is just not possible as not high was meant to be and so this this is only a win win\nFor for ER nurses for every nurse end and more importantly the patience of Massachusetts\nSaid this I don't like the scare tactics she says our emergency departments will fill up as patient patient's weight hours and hours to see someone\nI scare tactics you know don't scare people into voting your way that's cruel you know you were saying that there'll be more nurses and it will it will help there'll be more nurses on them or to take the patience to stop so if you were in the hospital and you know that you were going to be taken care of\nI mean I think there's no stuff is terrible\nAnd I have another letter here it's from I'm a I'm a firefighter named Paul\nJake's and he says firefighters have legally enforceable limits to ensure that they can use their resources Whelan perform their duties if if if and firefighters have limits\nRatios and why not nurses men Valentine Iran [laughter]\nJoan I feel like your friend you know 'cause you know we nurses relate [laughter] me too me too [laughter] we have our war stories and we really yeah something I didn't tell about telling you about before is is um\nI was a hospice chaplain for six years I went to see all at school\nBecause I was so\nBecause I was so\nI think I suffered for moral hazard and I think that I went home to many nights and this and said\nYou know this patient outcome was not good and it ate away at me and and so I got burned out you know before the term burn up was around I don't want to see\nAny nurse get burned out and if we don't have no I shouldn't that's a scare tactic we need a yes on number one we really do [noise]\nHarris similar reasons why\nSo here is another letter from a um another nurse who wrote in and this woman teachers in Boston um and my sister knows her and she says she is a fantastic nurse and she said mandated nursed a patient ratios\nHelp to reduce mortality rates in hospitals these days are all English on on a couple of you know when do we I can I can link those two people\nYou know you hate to think of people dying because there's nobody there\nMhm or there's there's nobody that picks up on um the patients condition has has dropped because you've been out of the world's twenty minutes three or four or five other patients but um I remember when I was a student nurses which some students when I was in the dark ages and I was working in the evening shift\nEverything was going fine and I went in to see um the patient by the window I'm to take his blood pressure and the patient enough on the uh in the first bed\nWas I'm supposed to be going home the next morning and he did not look well [noise]\nUm and so I went over and took his blood pressure and it had dropped precipitously\nAnd so I went over and took his blood pressure and it had dropped precipitously than some event going on and I went out and I called the supervisor recalled and emergency and you know for the nurses and doctors come along and they resuscitated them in and I'm like I'll tell ya what turned dogs but um\nThose things that happened\nYou know offer it in a ... in nursing and if you are not in the room or you haven't you know we used to walk by the Romans said you know I could tell when I walked in the room that there was something right right you know because you get to six cents ...\nHave you had that happen if you have experience too though you know something is not quite right and sometimes even the numbers look good but you know there's that thing in your head saying you have to keep an eye on him you need to check back need to make sure what's going on here maybe it'll get ... or more labs find out what's going on\nYou know and that comes with experience that something that you have to impart to the nurses coming up behind you you have to make sure and you have to make sure that they\nAre going to be bold enough because sometimes it takes a Boulder to say to me\nTo tell me about this you know you have to stand on your hind legs that you have to say to patients sick yeah I Want to hear now yes you need to come to you have to be assertive in the nurse needs them you can't be quiet you know do your job is to defend the patient and to watch out for the patient even if it means [noise]\nCalling a code occupation mhm yes indeed Nashua moral men do you take it on when you need ... you say an old season or yeah yeah that's the same as a doctor ... exactly and and when you go home and you think [noise]\nAh [noise] the patient and didn't you need to die and that\nYour heart and does things accumulates\n... dot breaks your heart and does things accumulate and they burn nurses up\nRight and that is what this ballot initiative is going to fix not completely but it will start it will start fixing that because you half the time you will have the time\nTo be with your patient to accurately assess them to make sure you're giving them the correct name to actually go to their discharge for just with this is when you have to go and see your doctor these are your medications\nTake your medications this this and this and don't take them with that and here's what we do and all this discharge process takes a long time to do it\nCorrectly and when you have a little older patients and me I knew my I have older again yes that that was my point is sometimes\nYou have to tell people like three times before they begin to understand that because there's so anxious heightened day they will just don't like this they can't take anything because they're fearful\nMhm you know I'm so the ... the third time they realize this person is taking time with me they care about me this is the thing I think about\nWhen when when nurses are rushing bashed the door I I'll be in in a minute you know and you know you just feel bad because you can't begin there now right [noise] um because you have to love to have your workload right [noise]\nUm is they feel like I don't matter this nurses and invested in ... it's like the teacher that doesn't have time to write and to pay attention to the to the people's right\nBut I again no matter how busy and nurses to me anyway this is the best job in the world I cannot do anything else and this this I\nThis is why I'm sitting here and the TV 'cause this is not my color I mean this is not like half or so here I Am that's my husband says let them go\nThis is not of my comfort zone here I Am\nThat's my husband says let's go from air sitting here on television program talking about nursing because this is important I Am so enthusiastic about this ballot initiative [noise]\nI'm In the I see I have my limits but I won't be any I see if I come in sick on my husband might not be in the ice he when he comes in sick so this needs to be for the whole of Massachusetts for everyone not just him really sick people is to stop the people who come in sick from getting sick of require in ICU\nAnd it really is cost effective to truly is with the the truly is it is in California has shown that well Jason to California as well California\nRegulations shall we say in two thousand and for the ... which limits the number of patients famous as ours um the only thing they didn't different from our ballot initiative dated not pushing the low\nThat would leave in our little we have put forward that the ... aides are ward clerics are diet ... people\nThey will be no reduction in their staffing levels California I think because I don't know they just they mate perhaps didn't think about the time we learned from that missing from their mistakes than we have in the ... there'll be no reduction in ... so\nThere's no point in me having for patients from the bedside nurse on the floors if I have to do ... job my aids job\nThis ward sick she's job all these other jobs that would\nNegate the whole day and so I think we're being very clever and that by pushing that forward and we have the other unions involved from the ... she wrote to build big came in and they were okay when our language and I think that protects their job because I think that was a concern for many but that was one thing we\nOf the day\nDay\nShe\n\nAnd um\n\nDay\n\n\n\nCan do\nIs keep those girls in it for\nDo and they can\nTo day and\nAge\nBird as being that lo\n\n... you know what I'm seeing you know that they said oh there's\nThe end\nWell you know we do\nIs let me see is that so that\nNa na\nNa na na\nNa na na\nShe can be just the one he wants to do\nUse the the again\nNa na na\nNa na\nThen a\nKnow there's no way he is going to\nDo the bit like you know\nA and I am as\nUm and I\nOf ...\nAnd they and their head no\nMay

were afraid to ask and carry\nMental illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask I'm Kerry Baluch community relations coordinator at for hospital and out of our Massachusetts a and with me is\nDirt mould him and I am a sufferer of mental illness and I'm trying to be here to try to break some stigmas that go along with it to carry um what are we trying to we're trying to do with this podcast year\nDerek I really feel that this podcast is meant to make individuals aware of mental health and mental illness in our communities to break stigma to educate 'em as somebody who has a background\nThe very diverse background and mental health um I can say that education outreach and community outreach are so important to the care and the continuity of care for individuals who are suffering from mental illness so I think we just really wanted to get the word out there\nSo I'm for people who don't know us when we do a little bit of a background of ... you know nothing to wiping showroom what brought you into this field Terry\nSo I actually started off on with a desire to be an art therapist\nBecause I had a passion for our and I had a passion for psychology um when I went to college I did my major to art in psychology and just figured you know what I'll see where life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my first job working for a a clubhouse model and hope deal math\nAnd I worked with the chronically mentally ill population but even beyond that there is there's a deeper passion that I have for the population besides the experiences that I've had\nWorking with these individuals my father my father is a diagnosed a individual with bipolar disorder and I seen him struggle throughout my entire life\nAnd I seen him struggle throughout my entire life and I've always had this soft spot in my heart\nFor it in perspective of mental illness is not just your label mental illness is just an aspect of you so from the outside world someone may see for instance my father and say that so and so that's where he has bipolar disorder\nBut I always knew him as dad that's my dad and he just happens that bipolar disorder that\nI strongly feel influenced my passion for understanding I got the human mind focusing on psychology and then leading into I'm\nLeading to working with individuals with chronic mental health disorders\nAs I said in this field in Massachusetts for about five years\nAnd then decided to make a life leap I moved down to Pennsylvania and I had the opportunity to work with a very different population and I've worked with individuals with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors as well as kind of mental health disorders it gave me a very different aspect\nOf Human Services and health care [noise]\nUm I was a a case manager for the majority of my time at the campus facility\nThat I had the opportunity to make a leap and moving more towards the\nAdmissions outreach community outreach marketing piece of the field which is quite a different step right to go from case management to marketing how does that work I offered a very unique and different aspect\nTo the role I had the opportunity truly both sides of or all sides of healthcare one of my things is often that facility organizations or in the business of providing\nAs is often that facility organizations or in the business of providing care you want to provide the best quality care for the individuals that you're serving but it's also a business and there is also needs to have to be addressed on on that end as well ah so fast forward um I stayed with its facilities called with services down in Lancaster, Pennsylvania\nI left there after about nine years to move back home and now I'm here at full or hospital\nWhich brings me to a follow up question with all that experience under your belt what is your ah what is your role here at Arbor off for a hospital\nSo my official title is community relations coordinator um where many hats I work as a liaison with our for all sources doctors' offices hospitals in Massachusetts Rhode Island\nI work on um marketing any sort of marketing needs I also focused on I'm planning on offense in community outreach events such as to pay for health and wellness fair um and I also work with our service excellence committee and teen hair\nTo ensure that our standard of care that we're providing individuals is I'm being met\nAs well as promoting an environment of excellence with in our hospital excellent\nSo Derrick tell me a little more about your history with mental illness\nUm I have a long history with mental illness um I remember having my ... when I was six years old and it's it's a memory that will be burned into my head for the rest of my life I've had anxiety all my life\nI think the great thing about fuller hospitals is actually used to be a family mansion back in the day and I was a community family here and so the old horse stables are actually a patient unit every single patients' rooms have windows\nBut I think the truth is is that we are here to deliver compassionate care\nBy license clinicians and psychiatrists we're here to do good work and so we spend our days\nGo into groups and I'm Talking to physicians and doing therapeutic interventions mean that that's I think not a perception of people are sitting around medicated and not receiving services and not getting engaged and that couldn't be further from the truth\nNow is one person or on my own I've been trying to break the stigma of mental illness by becoming very open a talking about a very openly not being embarrassed about it I Know why breaking the stigma of mental illnesses saw him on why do you think it's so important and why is it so hard to do\nYou know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um and it's rampant in our community because of the taboos what people believe I think it goes back to the institutional comments I just made\n'em but the truth is the vast majority of us us ourselves have a family member or friend who suffers from mental illness or substance abuse and so the truth is when we realized that it touches many many people in our lives and across all demographics\nUm socioeconomic genders race when we start to look at it and the impact that it has then I think people like you\nRace when we start to look at it and the impact that it has then I think people like you are opening people's eyes that that it does it impacts all of us I mean\nI have people who work for me and it's sort of the most amazing employees I have who have mental illness and carry a diagnosis and they're productive and engaged and compassionate and I would say they even bring an added level of care\nUm to our patients because they understand\nOn what it's like to live in those shoes I think the disease impacts a massive amount of the people in our community in this facility works to treat those people in a compassionate patient centered way\nUm and we also serve as a beacon in our community for those who are in need or who seek help to say we're here walking our front door you know let us let us off or resources are carrying I think you had a couple of questions I did [noise]\nRachel how do you think gender plays a role in mental illness I think that's an interesting concept because um and when we look at gender and societies impact on gender um we have all kinds of conceptions about how men and or women should behave and so\nThose social contracts of gender we we actually makeup and so what we believe about gender today is not how people perceive gender\nFifty one hundred a hundred and fifty years ago or in different countries for that matter the truth isn't impacts both men and women um but in some ways the way it impacts can be different we have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations I'm an act like we know how many should be\nUm and when they act less than that we call them weak or other more inappropriate names\nSo it makes it harder for men to seek treatment and so we see 'em for depression and anxiety less men receiving treatment for depression anxiety you see more women receiving treatment and so it's our job at this facility with the help of people like Derek to say this is an impact across the board and because\nLike Derek to say this is an impact across the board because people experienced trauma\nUm similarly and so how do we set the stage for a man to be able to walk in and say I need assistance with some of this stuff but also to honor that the vast majority of women have trauma histories and so how do we also creative facility\nAnd a team enter treatment team and physicians who are able to accept\nUm sexual assault survivors into this facility and treat them in a way that allows them to heal\nI think it's also important we are talking about gender to acknowledge that transgender gender community and so this facility has worked really hard\nTo make sure not only we abide by state statute and abide by hate crimes but that we worked diligently to create a facility that accepts all people period until whatever that looks like man woman transgender patient who comes in here and can be expected to be treated along with best practice to not be re traumatized\nBy coming into a facility that doesn't know how to engage all patience with equality and respect and dignity\nCan you give us an example or even a story of of of something that you've seen where you have been able to address this gender roles this gender issue within a mental health facility or setting\nThem I think I'd go back to um the trans community and I think it has been practice that I'm trans clients are trans patients will be put in single rooms and we'll have separate and apart bathrooms I think certainly history has told us um that separate is not equal\nAnd so we've worked diligently here to honor someone's known gender and so we have a trans man who comes in um we're putting him with a male roommates access to the male haul 'em as well as access to mail bathrooms and so\nWe frequently will get pushback around that and say what about the other clients\nAnd so we frequently will get pushback around that and say what about the other clients\nBut the truth is we navigate this every single day and a vast majority of different circumstances so people who are struggling with race issues and meant and may make racial comments we appropriately placed patients in rooms where they're going to have the most success and sometimes we have some of those around\nAnd that's the way it goes but setting the stage for every single person who comes in here to be treated with dignity\nTo honor their identity um honor the work that they need to do and create a healing space for them in fact to do that and we can't do that um if we set the stage from hello that we're not doing the right thing and not honoring who that human is and so I think it fall are we done an exceptional job all the way from ...\nTo honoring people's preferred names um and how does that look and how do we set the stage on the unit for that to be carry through from beginning to end from admission from the very first time you walk into this facility to the day you leave an every single staff is on the same page about\nWhat my expectations are of my staff about how we treat patients but also setting the stage across the board for other patients who are on the unit who may struggle who may not have information who may not have knowledge about that I'm In a way that's appropriate in confidential but again honors that individual patient\nI have I have a follow up to that um how tough has a learning curve been with the the transgender problems that the you know but you face here at the hospital right now I'm you know I mean I\nHonestly I think the learning curve is ongoing and I think it will be because you know I've done ... trains for hospital systems for schools for H R departments for Twenty years\nAnd honestly the trains I did Twenty years ago or a super different than the training so I Do today because language changes um expectations change statute and legislation changes um and the truth is more often than not it's the adolescent pop\nJust um and the truth is more often than not it's the adolescent population of the gay lesbian by trans kids who kind of drive and push forward some progress so the language isn't the same as Twenty years ago and so\nThe learning curve is ever present quite honestly\nHowever I Will say that the best practices we've put in place here\nKind of set the stage for expectations so we have a policy on how we engage and treat ... patients that addresses language pronoun use name use 'em while we can't change a healthcare card or a medical record that doesn't mean that we can't honor someone's\nName restroom room designation in a way that meets what their gender is so it's ever changing and were up for the task and I think we do it better than most quite honestly\nI think that it's been practice I'm not best practice practice for a while for trans patience to be placed in single rooms and have access to single bathrooms\nI think all the legislation around that particular that have come from students and parents\nI'm litigating with schools shows that that's not an acceptable practice and so a\nTrans kid or in fact now a trans patient shouldn't have to go use quote the principles bathroom or the nurses bathroom or be taken off the unit or be put in a single room now might not be an occasion when a transportation it is appropriate there's lots of reasons it's appropriate to put any patient in a single room for a vast majority of reasons\nHowever we should come from the place of we're honoring the gender of which they come in and and identify as the name the pronoun and we move forward accordingly and it's quite honestly that simple\nI think the whole bathroom issue has been caught up on 'em in a comical sex which is very very different from gender and so when we honor that someone's gender is exactly what they tell us that is it's super simple to move forward when when you break it down into its most simplest terms we honor\nFor simple to move forward when when you break it down into its most simplest terms we honor the gender of what a person identifies us and then it's very simple actually to move forward and will we have bumps of course we will but we have bumps for all kinds of different reasons and we navigate patients around those bumps so yes they board longer 'cause people are waiting for single rooms\nUm they board longer because people will struggle with doing the right thing and I'm I'm not even saying those things ... are malicious I think it's a matter of progressively catching up to where we are today and it was more and more people identifying as trans and being more comfortable\nIt it's I Know that we don't have more trans people than we've ever had actually trans people have been revered\nIn our country and across the world for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years they were known as our ... which doctors first nation doctors however it's in the last hundred years that we've started persecuting and the level of violence in this community particularly a chance trans woman of color\nUm has gotten completely and utterly out of control so it's very simple when you break it down to its most simple terms do the right thing by an identified gender and everything else falls into place\nSounds like that there is a definite need for education um within our state I think our country and our communities I Know that for um our health system\nSo now they would call me at midnight or one or two or three in the morning and say hey I'm having an anxiety attack okay calmed down it's going to be okay I'm In coming out on Facebook you know that was\nThat was my big thing like I said it was a huge weight lifted off my shoulder and there was no blowed everybody's like proud of you you know and I knew some people knew but I don't think they knew to what degree in how bad it was\nAnd doing that you know people you know the chicken I hey how you doing haven't seen a baseball can awhile haven't heard from your while I'm having a tough time so like I said you know I just one of my life back\nThat was the biggest thing so I don't I don't understand why you know I I you know from when you said before you get called names and stuff like that but if you've got friends and you've got a great support system\nThey're not going to hold it against you got and granted I lost some friends but most of my friends when I came out and I told them what I was suffering from they did research on it so they could try to help me\nRight handed or engage conversation\nRight they would go on the Internet and they just wouldn't say oh it's an excuse is it's an excuse he's using his his anxiety depression and his panic as an excuse well no I'm not and if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use as an excuse\nI use breaking down my cars an excuse to cover up my mental illness don't cover it up anymore I wear a badge I own it but it doesn't define who you know who I Am anymore\nYou know that was part of the reason so I I live in this community right I used to live six minutes down the road and I would drive by the hospitals consistently and actually only knew of this hospital because I also ran a behavioral health um facilities in Rhode Island and so when I first got hired here I thought you know not that's\nThese in Rhode Island and so when I first got hired here I thought you know that that's my local grocery store next door um this is the main thoroughfare more people need to understand what the White House on the hill is because\nWhen we start to understand that fuller is integrated in this community people who live and work here I'm living this community\nAnd so when Kerry came on the first thing I ever said to her as I went to community fair on our front lawn\nAnd lo and behold less than half a year later you know she produce four hundred people in\nFifty um community resource vendors\nAnd so and that's where I'm at you and so that that's important right that's how we do this is come on my front lawn meet my staff\nSay hello carnival games for the kids let me show you who we are and what we're about and what we do here so that we can again we're always working to kind of reduced the stigma that you continue to talk about\nBecause the truth is people work at fuller because we are looking to help people make their lives better and people are here because they're struggling there's not anyone in this facility who isn't currently sick and so\nHow do we get them better and part of it is isn't a community fair is things like the semi colon project so that we started to have some visibility around mental health and so we'll have another community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to come on our front lawn to hang out with us\nUm because the truth is that's the only way to start to break it down\nYou know I had to put us I put a banner out front that says walking welcome because I Want people to know that you can walk into our front door you don't have to make a call you don't have to get a PCP referral you don't have to go to an emergency department\nAnd that doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either it means I'm struggling can you help and our answer is always going to be yes what is it you need and how to\nCan you help in our answer is always going to be yes what is it you need and how do we make it happen and you know my my staff kind of makes fun of me consistently but what am I saying as we come from a place of yes here\nAnd so can we make it happen the answer is yes can I help that patient the answer is yes can I get you to where you need to go next yes can I make you feel better yes\nAnd what we can do it alone we can do without the patient engagement we can't do it all out with a whole team um but the answer is yes we come from a place of yes how can I help yes come in my front door yes come and ask for help yes we will be there to answer\nWhat would you like people to know about fuller aside and you know you don't want people just think oh that's the house up on the hill with the crazy people go right so your your final thoughts what do you want people to get out of today's a message\nI I'd like them to see solar as a resource there are engaged staff there are you know my CFO started hairs housekeeper and never left and he still has his housekeeping shirt on the back of his door\nYou know my director of facilities full or on the entire neighborhood out behind here and ah his mom was a nurse here and he grew up with full of rent and his mom one of those houses and he's never left here I'm that's what fuller is\nFull or as a place that has engaged staff who are here saying we want to help we're here to help\nBut this community should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to a needy do not have to go to a clinic you do not have to go to your PCP and it doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either I'm a partial hospitalization program where you can go for the day I have an intensive outpatient program where you can go three times a day or do half days\nThere are many many options to get you help 'em that don't necessarily end up an inpatient level of care however we have that if that's where you are as well and so if people could start to see fuller one is a place that's accessible because that's very important to me um but to as a resource\nThe accessible because that's very important to me um but to as a resource um and even if it's just to go straight to outpatient\nHow do we help you set up that therapist appointment that has just been too hard for you to do on the outside because patients if they could have done it they would have already done it right no one's more committed to a patient care than the patient themselves and so frequently I find if they could have made something happened they already would have\nAnd so how does fuller offered that next step to actually get them that peace will ever whatever it is we should be accessible um and we should come from place to be I\n... I just honestly want to say thank you for your ah participation today hearing you help sick in front of the reason why I Know personally I'm here and I work um for this hospital\nYou are a fantastic leader and example and the mental health community and I have seen that firsthand I'm I think that the feedback that you provided today has been very insightful and hum heartwarming when it comes to moving forward with mental health in our community and wearing is in breaking stigmas\nSo thank you again for joining us today we really appreciate it I think he will appreciate you guys [noise]\nSo we want to thank our ritual legend that was some I'm very informative information that we had here today in great first guest a great way to start off as someone who will once again who suffers from mental illness or just want to let people know out there that you're not alone that there is help\nYou just need to seek it and if you think there's something not right going on\nA better to be safe than sorry don't wait until you're at the point where there's no coming back from it there's a lot of help out there in in ... got a lot of good information right here right now about what you can do and where you can seek help carry\nGreat thank you there and so for those that may live in the ...\nCarrie great thank you Derek [noise] uh [noise] so for those that may live in the adult borrow a greater out of our community um you may be aware of may not be aware that there is a drop in center called the you are not alone dropping center\nAnd this was a collaborative between full or hospital ... police department and area organizations to offer services and resources to people in the greater out of our community regarding mental health\nAnd substance abuse disorder the you are not alone dropping center a is held the last Wednesday of every month at the bar a unitary universal is church at five oh five north main street here and I don't borrow\nFrom five thirty eight PM or we focus essentially on just trying to get people to help that they need we offer um representatives and information from a tremendous amount of resources in the area\nFrom an inpatient level of care such as solar to outpatient resources such as South Bay to community groups such as learned to cope\nUm if you like to learn more about the drop in center you can find us on Facebook I'm at a bar a recovery\nUm you can also contact us directly at five oh wait two two two one two one two accents you one nine five one\nTo learn more about this dropping center and what would we absolutely welcome anybody in the community uh we do focus on anonymity you're more than welcome to come whether you're a family member or individual who needs help\nTo access resources um or to even see voluntary treatments at night now in addition to the dropping center I I'm very honored to be a part of their hospital\nAnd um the resources that were able to offer if you have questions about um our our resources or services um please feel free to on either contact me directly um again Carrie\nPlease feel free to um either contact me directly um again carry Baluch community relations coordinator here at four hospital um you can contact the main number five zero eight seven six one eighty five hundred\nAnd we also except to walk and I think that's something that surprised with a lot of people and you'll see a giant banner on the front as ... as Rachel had mentioned\nUm please feel free to come to our hospital we are we are available and open twenty four hours a day for additional information regarding um folders services\nYou can also go to Arbor health dot com\nAnd select Arbor fuller hospital in out of our own Massachusetts so if you are in crisis and you needed some additional helping the community are outraged here is the ah the CBC emergency service provider they are located at five oh eight to eight five Ninety four hundred\nA their addresses went away west main street speed number five and Norton masses zero two seven six six they are available twenty four hours a day um and are able to assess with assessment of your mental health needs\nDa\n\n\n\nYou're listening to W.
