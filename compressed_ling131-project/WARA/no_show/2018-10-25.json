collected a bunch of food a bunch of pet supplies um there was a you know create their food\nAnd toys and whatnot and then I actually met her mother to when I was campaigning and I and I recognize the face but I couldn't put it together where I met her uh but anyway to her and help do and then I mentioned like I'd love to have you on the radio because you do a lot in our community too so uh it's great to have you on\nHold I think I Know it feels like it was so long ago\nI Know [laughter] but um so I figure become ... um to like me who you are kind of we'll talk about the dance factory to a different products you guys work on a one off but to start or could you just explain a little boat or like a bio of you who you are kind of what you do\nShort sell my name is Aaron Riley and I'm the director and owner and the teacher at the dance factory now to borrow and it's\nThree three paychecks [laughter] um where located downtown outta\nBerlitz thirty five parked street and um this is my fifteenth year in business so we're celebrating a special anniversary this year and um before I owned the dance factory I went to Bridgewater state college and I got my teacher's\nLicense in the state of Massachusetts to teach dance and I received my bachelor's degree in dance education\nMassachusetts to teach dance and I received my bachelor's degree in dance education so I've been there the my whole life and I'm having the dance studio has been a goal of mine since I was in elementary school so\nThat's all I used to work in the dominance wrote down the street from Bridgewater oh get out a new smugglers lose the usual ... three o'clock in the morning we uh we were doing repeats of to Bridgewater I'm sure you would regard him on a [laughter] ... cool all your your degrees when uh\nMy degree in dance education and they have a minor in um education so my my background is learning how to be a teacher so as long as I knew I you know you can be a good dancer you can be a great performer\nBut we just ran out of space and we didn't have enough seats so we got to move to that venue and that's very exciting I think it's important for the kids to be able to have their end\nIt's important for the kids to be able to\nHave their end of the year performance in a space that makes them feel like they're rock stars like it's a really nice theater the the whole entire staff there is awesome\nUm so that's something we get to do every year we've done we do local competitions during the year the like I said the competition team they've danced as the halftime show for the Harlem Globetrotters\nWe've performed um during the intermission further Providence Bruins um we've done the out of our Memorial Day parade let's see what else have we done\nUm we've dance that um the life care center and out of our all that lost a lot so we've done a lot of different um things and like I said we have that annual performance every year at um at the Veterans Memorial auditorium that's kind of like the big thing that you know combinations everything\nThat's awesome I'm kind of jobs I was a neutral kind of like the dance world intro supposedly going in there [laughter] like in terms of like competition or as a um with different studios or you're competing with or is it would just will soon\nYes I'm you signed up you go to a regional competition and with\nAnyone from anywhere could sign up to go to that competition and then the competitions are divided by age group group size um the subject that they're performing tap jazz ballet hip hop whatever it might be ...\nUm and then also by how many hours there in the studio\nAnd recently our group just got bumped up to the most competitive category which was awesome you know we started in the in like the the entry level which was like the recreational category they would call it and\nUm they've they've been doing\nThe ... category they would call it and um they've they've been doing better every year so we got bumped bumped up to a more competitive category in the past\nUm I've learned lots of choreography awards and last year we won the studio of excellence\nAward at the United states tournament of dance and then this past year we just won um readers choice for best dance school from the readers of some chronicle so if you read the sun chronicle and voted for us thank you that was great\nSo basically earns a big deal who [laughter] who doesn't want [laughter] for that's cool yeah I was curious how well I just didn't know too much about the dance competitions in general yeah um\nIt's I think it's just like anything else if if it's not something that you have ever been exposed to you know you don't really know anything about it if you didn't um if you didn't have any sisters or or ... I mean 'cause how or you saw something on TV that sparked their interest or show that you know he's a\nUm yeah I mean it's just like anything else if you asked me a question about something I had no experience and I would no nothing\nSo [laughter] and then we'll oh it was a dancing with the SARS is always a popular show with you and your students or is it like\nI'm ... I like world of dance personally and I I I like I like dancing with the stars we all like Derek tough And Julian half but this just the commercials are there's so many commercials and there's so much talking I'd like to show me that they are saying [laughter] but I\nI Will I Will watch anything\nThat's related to that because you never know what you're going to see that are going to give you an idea or it might sparks something that makes you think of something else I I Try to expose myself to all different all different um\nIn ... I I Try to expose myself to all different all different um Dijon rhythm of dance and TV shows that have dancing in it or\nI'm going to see different shows like live shows live theater or listening to all different kinds of music on so that you're you're exposed and you're always up to date\nUm I always try to the teachers and I at the studio we always try to stay current and\nTry to keep taking classes or do online tutorials or go to different workshops and classes so that we're improving as teachers and we're not getting stale and stagnant in what we're teaching the kids and we're trying to stay current and see what you know the kids are interested in too because\nYou know it just keeps them more engaged in you know the material that we're teaching them\nYeah I'm going to show it almost curious about this 'cause my ... my ...

I mean to me it was okay with someone who has a different but uh but I was like I Can't\nI don't know if like I have a lot of patience but I don't know if I can try to choreographed for the first group and a lot\nOf patients all you can't take anything like I said everybody\nWe're screwed on a lot of patience and\nYou can't take anything like I said everybody learns differently that's that's what they touch in school and you can't take it personally if somebody doesn't get something right away and you just have to think of all the different ways that\nYou could explain something to someone or you know some people see things and they learn it some people here things and they learned some people\nLearn things by doing it so every less than that you plan\nYou have to incorporate you know those three different ways to make sure everybody in the class gets the concept you're working on and and I have a lesson plan for every class that we teach so every forty five minute class that I teach I've probably spent an hour\nYou know pre planning and making sure that you know I've got all the information I Need to make sure that everybody learned what they need to learn\n... I mean to me I'm ... I Want to know that all from ... to ... to think of it what it's like there's a huge educational a component to to them but it's not just like you know it's not just like a physical activity like in the sport but also learning that goes on right on the scene\nAnd and I think it it teaches kids time management skills because they go to school all during the day and then you know they get out of school and they have to learn to come home and get their homework done or if they want to join an after school program they have to do that\nAnd then do their homework and then eat dinner and then come to dance and then you know that's that's an important life skill I'm learning to listen and follow directions and be part of a team and knowing when to be a leader and when to be a team member\nUm and you know just learning how to be a respectful you know person in society so I mean it's definitely a lot of\nYou know life skills too as well it's not just the issues when he was\nA lot of you know life skills too as well it's just yeah\nIt's just like in sports like they're learning something then they probably wouldn't learn in a in a classroom that's right that's how I always looked at sports 'cause sometimes like discipline and just working as a ... year with discipline yeah yeah yeah but already folks re Sunni what Aaron Riley talking about the dance factory she is the

different programs that she offers at the studio to open to all ages boys girls\nUm Israelis Eighteen months ... months yeah and what's the oldest you\nGo on our weekly classes go up to um Eighteen years old and then our we have adult classes and those are dropping classes there like once a month they're based on interest so if you are an adult and you're out there and you want to learn how to dance\nYou should give us a call it the Bible eight to to to out to a seven and just say what you're interested in\nAnd we've done ballet classes we've done tap jazz hip hop\nI'm like I said the adult classes are just strictly based on interest and dropping so it's a short term commitment they there once a month in the summertime we do like a five week program so it's like very short real quick and you know dropping classes to fit your busy schedule\nThis sort of dropping ... you you have a day for and if\nHappen to Tuesday's such and such a day from this time to this time and new calls the

thinking to during the break the uh so you're the owners are director the teachers are a lot of different hats\nI wear a lot of different attitude [laughter]\nSo I was wondering are when you're starting a business what was ... like remember the one of the biggest concerns you were hired or worries are you worried about something in how you uh overcame\nWell when I started\nI was very naive and didn't know what I should have been afraid of now Fifteen Years into it now you know you have more knowledge and now you know what you\nYou know you need to worry about um when I first started I we were in the little teeny building and like I said I I came fresh out of college and\nWhen your you know when you're that age you know everything [laughter] so um I you know expected I Would have tons and tons of people and my family teases me I about this I wanted to sign that says the line forms here\nAnd then like nobody came to registration and it was just me by myself so [laughter]\nBut um you know and like I said it things the studio grows and once you find like your niche and your mission statement and once everything once I found that and I said okay I Need to be your neighborhood dance school the professional serious dance school for everyday people\nOf all ages and levels than you know that's when you know I really found myself and found you know our niche of\nThat's when you know I really found myself and found you know our niche of of being a dance studio but you know learning how to I'm lucky that\nI get to worry about the fun stuff at my business I worry about the classes and the kids and choreographing the dances and when I Need to teach the kids pick out the costumes editing the music all of that fun stuff I'm lucky because my parents\nUm are my business partners and I my we all have our jobs that we worry about everybody stays in their lane and we just do it and I like I said I get to worry about the fun stuff my dad\nWorries about all the money things and things that have to get paid for and when I'm and then my mom worries about all the registration and you know everybody has the bookkeeping and answering the phones and taking messages and\nUm you know being at the front desk I mean when when the building that we bought was for sale\nI drove by thirty five park straight in the morning 'cause usually I go to the studio in the morning and I do on my planning I return on my phone calls all the ... the behind the scenes stuff and then I go home and then they come back um after lunch and and start teaching\nBut in the morning I drove by thirty five parked street and the window was empty and the building was empty and then when I drove back\nTo go home at lunch time there was a for sale sign the window and all I had to do and like

Seventeen percent of the city's tax value that's down from nearly thirty percent years ago\nNow if that tax split remains at one twenty eight homeowners actually would see an increase in their bill of

whether time to go out and be instructing porches and putting it in and it it is a ... a lot of [noise] the work that I Do is you know fixing people's gutters or repairing the stairs to the house of things that require working outdoors and are you getting a little work\nWhere I live in the back there and I remember actually helping yeah I was helping my friend ... this was before right before I started my company I I was helping my friend who was who is ... building a garage\nAnd I helped them finish up the last little bit on the garage and um and it's it looks gorgeous had to work you guys yeah I'm well is is\nMainly him at that point but he did a great job but um yeah I like to think we'd myself in the few people helped me do it to an excellent job as well um [noise] but so what type of an off my about ah you know so many issues and and let me just say\nWhatever you can get and to be on a show like this people will want you to talk about certain topics or they might say hey look if you don't want to talk about something you know we don't have to\nBut I'm open to discussing anything that people want to talk about and ah you know I Know one of the things that that's come up is the relationship between the ... in in the city council and a lot of people are very timid and and concerned about ... talking about ah\nLet me first say I know all the members of the city council and several of them I Know really well and I know Paul her rule I I mean I've only known Paul for a short period of time\nAnd I don't always agree with everything he's proposed or some sometimes\nI don't even agree with a lot of what he's proposed but I Know that Paul is an honest hardworking guy who's trying to do the best he can ... ah I I think you know it's never easy transitioning from one physician to being ... you know I I've been fortunate in my life\nThe transitioning from one physician to being ...\nYou know I I've been fortunate in my life you know I had four friends who will form a mess and I was able to be mentored when I was younger by all of these people and they would all tell you the same thing that the first year of being met no matter how well prepared you are you could be the smartest guy going\nThat you know it's it's like being on a ship during the storm you know the waves just keep coming over the ... the ship and uh I Know Paul said some serious bumps in the road but I think like most people\nI Want to see a mass succeed because in his success leads to the success of our community you know I think um they're always reasons to criticize anybody I mean I did many things in the council that was probably worthy of criticism and then maybe some things that the man has done that's worthy of criticism [noise]\nBut but I don't like this when I hear people exaggerate or make up stories about things that's not that's not good democracy when we start attacking people rather than just voice in I hired a disagreement\nWe have a phone call and a sixteen after the hour of eight o'clock hello you're on WNPR a\nLoan and Jon Davis still there he is okay this is a supporter and ... how do you do and\nYou're the first candidate ... ... ... so much about

I guess was some position now I don't remember exactly what it was ... he worked in ... yeah he had been defiant decent Pataki and when he retired\nThey bought a home here in ... oh wow and again it gets to the point of\nThis something about how to grow that draws people here\nYou know the reason we're building all these new developments is because a lot of the people that grew up here have stayed so for new people to move in we have to build additional homes sure ah it's funny how many people I've run into campaigning\nThat I've known since like kindergarten first grade it's really it's it's really you know you know this thing and not and that's the part\nThat you know I mean I I'm this interviews about you and your candidacy but for me living in another state\nInterviews about you and your candidacy but for me living in another state growing up in another state\nI I'm slowly realizing the compassion the love and everything that people share and ... everybody knows everybody I mean I grew up with everybody you know people that I've met all I Know her she was in my class and you know you guys are all kind of\nI'm the guy here that's thirty two years I feel like I'm now pretty much without the accent I'm a bass player except my\nYou know middle go John I'm going to tell I'm gonna tell us a funny story that indicates the kind of help you get in our community when my wife and I first moved into the home where now where she grew up uh there was a snow storm in her car was in the driveway and the battery was that it wouldn't stop\nSo I tried to pull my car up next to her just to jumpstart the car and I get stuck in a snow back oh my car was stuck\nIn a while I was out there I Can't believe the number of neighbors and people who are driving by who stopped to help me get out of the snow back now I was embarrassed for being dumb enough to drive into the snow bank so I'm humiliated\nBut there are probably and I'm not joking there are probably sixteen to Eighteen people out there who are trying to help me get my car out of the snow back\nIf that doesn't and and I was new to the neighborhood at the time you know maybe some of these people knew who I was but I'm betting most of them didn't\nAnd uh you don't see that everywhere that I'd be willing to say you don't see that in many places and\nUh yeah I'm Still kind of a little embarrassed now telling the stories that you're stuck in the snow bank and you were trying to jumpstart my wife's car was there in the driveway on a jet it ever gets started oh yeah eventually eventually we got someone would much longer jumper cables so that we didn't have to have the ... side by side because\n... and I don't know what I was thinking you know how it is in the morning there's a problem in your your just\nRight because I don't know what I was thinking you know how it is in the morning there's a problem you you're you're just rush in and say oh okay I'm In it and then I'm stuck\nWith me I've I've been in situations or remember one of the royal park their World War one memorial over\nThere was a young lady there whose car stalled and you know my my late father Frank the mechanic is looking down at me going see Tom you should have spent which I'm Around you and me she couldn't get her car started she has a battery cable so I sold my car up next to hers\nAnd I for the life of me okay so it's OK black as negative or read is okay and I ended up putting the cables on wrong I blew out her battery or something so I had the triple a [laughter] and I'm like all I was I was walking up there walking\nAnd I think that's incredibly profound that it's true you know some day the people on the council will be nothing more than a picture on the wall but the decisions they make will affect the lives of literally hundreds of thousands of people over the next decades or who have no idea who who those guys were\nVery well said very well said five oh\nWho who those guys were\nVery well said very well said five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty is our number to call Jon Davis city council at large candidate with us killed in a while the about another Fifteen minutes or so\nIf you have a comment or question there was somebody on the line there should have gotten to them\nA please give us a call or maybe you have an issue you want to bring up or something our question\nThat you want to ask the candidate by the way again we should tell folks there is a debate tonight\nSeven o'clock is it at city hall that city hall city hall um and it's sponsored by the north ... cable correct I Believe so I Believe that and what I read all the sun chronicle and so I think the sun chronicle have people I think I've been told the poll I\nBelieve hall Healy is going to ask a ... he's going to be one of the pie that's it I'm taking the night off I'm going over there and I would be very male you wonder what [laughter] yes\nYeah the the way Paul came in here a little while ago [laughter] um [laughter] so ah anyway yeah I Am a pall I was just on his show a couple of years ago that he asked some really really good question and I I I enjoyed it yeah so funny\nHe's witty a very bright he's he's dangerously\nVariety I say well that's it as he is also really clever people worried about is\nHe he kids a lot with me sometimes I I kinda okay Paul sure no problem and I come back a week later and but he he's a definitely a good for another he does great with the sports So Peter Gail be over there I'm Paul Haley I'm probably\nJim hand but yeah I don't know who they're sending from the chronicle but there'll be someone who has gone awry me still I think he freelancers yeah and I'm not sure I didn't I didn't okay that but but\nYou freelance and yeah and I'm not sure I didn't I didn't okay that but but but we have some and unfounded like I guess when you go back to the phone lines here hello you're on W. A. R. A. hello\nHello Tom it to him with a quick whether update and I had a quick question right afterwards for Mr Davis yes\nAnyway I just want to update we have again a lot of high clouds up there just doing the sun but overall\nAre not going to reach temperatures are somewhere in the middle and upper forties this afternoon we'll have wins out of the northwest little breezy and then we'll have the as you like to say moonshine healthier Tom [laughter] anyway [laughter] the fall hunters moon though you probably saw it\nLast night and if you were watching it costs the red Sox game you can see that the moon over Fenway Park last night I guess it gave him good luck or falling to thirty we'll have another frost in the morning\nOr scraping the windshield off with frost if you're unfortunate enough to have to leave your car outside like I Do for all my life and then tomorrow sunshine or some high clouds late a head of the developing storm or not a bad day tomorrow in good news for the football games tomorrow evening high school or right around forty degrees with\nVery little wind at all should reach about fifty tomorrow afternoon and then we will have rain and wind or sort of a remnant moisture merging with this thing from what was the big hurricane that hit the Pacific coast the other day or that storm was with us now that really is now bringing rain the remnants of it to the\nGulf Coast places that were hit by Michael er last week a couple of weeks ago the Pensacola area that is the storm that's going to develop\nTonight [noise] excuse me tonight and develop and bring us rain and wind on Saturday now Saturday are likely to be above his lousy a day in October as you can get without getting a two fledge hurricane we're going to have us gusty winds rain moderate to heavy at times a windswept out of the east\nAnd now that means temperatures only about fifty degrees\nI'm a windswept out of the east\nAnd now that means temperatures only about fifty degrees so if you have a choice this weekend I have to be outside for any reason and you have a choice between Saturday and Sunday I Would say Sunday better not that Sunday as I've been saying all morning I was going to be a picnic day but uh it'll just be mostly cloudy with a shower too high in the mid fifties\nAnd then one more weaker weather system for Monday a light rain off and on missed\nHighs in the fifties and then the good news Tom as we head into the Halloween situation course Tuesday is the day before the thirtieth sunshine puffy clouds back to about fifty\nAnd right now I'm thinking or mid to upper fifties for next Wednesday Halloween and into the evening for the trick or treaters whether at this point looks dry well actually get November off on a next Thursday November first off to temperatures that might get up as well sixty five degrees above that\nThat sounds great sixty five is good I like it is\n[laughter] yeah and that's ... that's a the first day of my least favorite month of the year two least favorites for me\nI and as you know what I said you Tom before if it wasn't for Thanksgiving and Christmas November and December it would be the worst time of the year ... or ... in the northern hemisphere for most people because uh we have our cloudy it's windy weather are shorter stays in November and December\nAnd really one of the only things that kinda screws it up at least for most people are the two big holiday so that's obviously down the road but my question for Mr Davis\nYes you do to nights a week of the event tonight\nOr thinks over the years in the Internet social media is women in these get togethers face to face that you guys and women and then getting the public we're limited nobody knew very little face to face communication and\nIt just is tonight really going to be a debate or is it just going to be giving statements but you guys\nThis is tonight really going to be a debate or is it just going to be giving statements but you guys can't talk to each other\nRight you make an excellent point that in this day and age it's been a long time since we had any real debates I think actually the last real debate in ... was in two thousand seven when I debated against mirror Robbins that um Mick do miss that a good a scheme\nAh tonight's forum will basically be us making little speeches in answering a few questions\nBut there'll be no interaction between the candidates which I think is a shame that\nUh that that's a good that's a good question and that that's a question I've been asking for years\nUh I don't know I mean I guess it's it's ... it's a preview of the people who are putting on the event I think people are afraid I'm of conflict you know that oh well we don't want people to get too emotional we don't want them to be too great of a battle between individuals\nBut I think sometimes as you talk about social media today there's not a lot of face to face communication with people anymore everybody thinks that you know that Facebook is what it's all about you know and and again I mean I think both of my opponents have far more advanced Facebook accounts than I Do\nYou know I'm I may I may be old school I actually think if someone has a problem I Want to talk to them face to face\nSo that we can explain exactly what's what's going on\nIs that Mr David how ironic is that what you're just that it's called Facebook yeah nobody really seen each other face to face\nIn one of the other issues with social media is it is allow people to almost anonymously make outrageous statements about other people and to spread information that that isn't factually accurate\nI mean one again when the important things you do as a councilman is to provide information to people if you're providing information that isn't completely accurate\nInformation to people if you're providing information that isn't completely accurate you're really doing a disservice to the public\nIs very little accountability because some of these people whoever they offer any ... anything that goes on in the media ... matter of I don't know why they even called social media it's really not a media I think there's a discussion\nBut they can just say whatever they want they can be downstairs and they're in their seller just making ridiculous statements and like you say there's no accountability\n... you're absolutely right it's it's it's but again I think we're in a a a learning process here with this new form of social media I think as time goes on um you know a lot of the bugs will work itself out but uh as I say that people know if if if you're looking for someone who's going to have a really fancy\nWeb page and this you know state of the ... Facebook page to be your representative then you might want to think about voting for someone other than me 'cause that's not me I'm the old school guy who if you have a problem I have no problem when you come into my house and sitting down in my living room and talking to me face to face or\nI'll go to your house and talk to you or or whatever but uh this idea of just doing things by text message there's a lot of miscommunication that takes place would would text message in in all this Facebook activity and\nUm I think you make a really excellent point I Would love for them to be a real debate when you know again when I first entered this race I thought they were going to be a half a dozen experienced political people involved where\nWe can ... you know have a serious heated discussion about tax policy then and you know issues that are really significant but uh you have to have some government knowledge and background to be able to have a educated debate on those issues and I think that situation hasn't quite presented itself\nYeah well I Wish you the best and thank you an\nOld old school for decades as always work\nYeah well I Wish you the best of thank you an old\nOld school for decades as always work with or face to face and again how ironic Facebook is not face to face [laughter] and uh getting\nNo seriously and and again uh I Wish all of them everybody well but let's let's let's be lost face to face now\nAre you there Jim who I think we lost him I'm Sorry I think we have another call let's go\nI've been to counseling for eight years in my past and I've never met a person yet who didn't say I did a good job now some people may not personally like me or disagreed with some of the things I've done but truly I've never met anyone who didn't feel that I did a good job as a councilman\nAnd I think today having been away for a few years and and have matured and gain some ... some more perspective that I can do even better job representing the community than I did a decade ago okay\nAnd do an even better job representing the community than I did a decade ago\nOkay and I'm sure we're going to be hearing more comments from all three candidates coming up to Minnesota about John thank you for coming in and you make you time and any time time okay All right thank you\nUh we have a gym James Jones here let's go to James I'm not going to find him let's see are you right there yeah I'm here are you\nVery well so I just wanted announced the U.S tonight is the the big forum at city hall mhm sponsored by the sun chronicle moderated by Peter Gay panelists Paul Healy and a\nConveyor we'll build their um they'll both the live tonight on channel Fifteen and Ninety eight it is a first up is the city council at large race up after that as the at eight o'clock is the\nState rep I'm for him it's not really a debate but uh I just wanted to add one more little thing mhm\nWe don't give a Dunkin' Donuts gift cards for new college but\nThat was the case or we'd be broke a rare though [laughter] I don't want to have for you do it not ah I I'm joking ...\nOr ... I don't want to get like a flood of calls everybody on that that they don't get any donuts gift card and you know I I had to fight us hey that gets people listening and yeah you have the radio you always a about gas I think that's a wonderful idea but\nAnyway and should go and I'm the one that find on some level\nAnyway hey I'm One of the things before you go can you tell me why this CD didn't work I don't know how to help me and our exit for next week right um yeah yeah okay okay All right W.

our people too and uh everyone everyone deserves to have their human rights and their dignity protected a lot of the pushback are a lot of the people against question three\nIf you've got a pain is you use the men's room if you were born without one you use the ladies' room how much simpler could this be well it's not that simple and I'm not going to read this whole column yesterday I'm from the New York times but I did attempt to address the\nBLM yesterday I'm from the New York times but I did attempt to address the intersects issue when Lori was on this program the other day and um I butchered it so just some factual information from someone who had no\nAh this was her column yesterday a leisure Ross Weigel I was born intersects\nIf you're not sure what that means I don't blame you by some estimates almost two percent of the world's population is intersects like me but still living in the shadows of stigma and shame now two percent of the world's population\nIf there were seven billion people in the world and got my masters right um and there's more than seven billion people in the world now but if there were seven billion people in the world two percent of that\nIs fourteen million people fourteen million people worldwide\nAre intersects meaning born with a hardware or components from both sexes male and female\nFourteen million that's a lot of people if they were fourteen million of them obviously obviously this is\nThese people being among us is part of God's Plan whatever his plans are her plans are whatever her plans are like any human being could possibly possibly\nUnderstand or know her plans but think of that fourteen million people are intersects\nStigma knows no borders and neither did my body\nWell I had X Y chromosomes I did not respond to masculine icing ... hormones in the womb and us stop developing at a certain point a point between what we consider to be the binary sexes hence intersects\nAnd what we consider to be the binary sexes hence intersects Alisa Roth why go goes on to write I was just born with female anatomy on the outside but with the internal ... but with internal ... instead of ovaries\nDoctors alongside my parents decided when I was still a baby that I Would be raised as a girl this decision that shape the course of my entire life but was made without my consent\nAgain so she was born I'm with the male anatomy on the outside but with internal ... testicles going ads are on the inside\n\nA doctor's alongside my parents decided when I was still a baby that I Will be raised as a girl this decision to shape the course of my entire life but was made without my consent she goes on to write I woke up Sunday morning to news that the Trump Administration\nIs planning um\nTo federal civil rights laws that would define sex as either male or female an changeable determined by the genitals a person who was born with and that any confusion would be clarified through genetic testing most people have interpreted this effort as a blow to transgender rights\nAnd it is but it made all this and I'll be right with your caller amid all this the fate is the fate of inter sex people where with such a change leave me rightfully sure\nMy body would throw this Trump Ian test for a loop my naturally occurring occurring genitalia did not match the correct genetic code in this forest binary paradigm that seems to override biology here's another curve ball what Mr ...\nThat seems to override biology here's another curve ball what Mr Trump's memo defines as an changeable is anything but I notice because the process of realizing a gender via hormones and surgeries\nYeah and I get it wouldn't it be easier for all of us if if if it was that simple you're either born with one of your or you're not\nUm I remember I'm not sure if it was a PBS or National Geographic\nOr was it sixty minutes\nI don't know but this was at least five years ago\nI remember watching a documentary about the intersection community in India\nAnd again here in this country when a child is born intersects pretty apparent right away um the decision is made in the old days the parents weren't even involved that doctors would make the decision themselves do we pull it out or push it in um nowadays the decision is usually made with the parents\nWithout the consent of the child the new baby a well what do we do here\nWe can make them fit the binary male or female with a surgery like in this case\nThe male or female with a surgery like in this case\nI'm up up up up up up up\nUp for me surgery to remove my own ads as an infant was the first stop on my tractor becoming female but the train didn't stop there my family was consulted about how five feet eight five feet eight inches seemed like the optimal height and informed on how hormone levels and sequences could be calibrated to achieve just that\nThey calculated the ideal breast size for my frame\nI can still remember the male Dr nodding approvingly I was also given a die later before he hit my teens so am I\nWell you are so my ...

you know the connection between rhetoric and violence is not really a strong there's a lot of people suggest but it's very different when it is an authority figure who seems to be ... sanctioning the violence\nAnd whether that is a matter of the police not responding to this kind of violence as aggressively as they do\nOther kinds of political violence or certainly when a position in the ... in an authority like President Trump is saying things that seemed to suggest to people that this is okay that the government supports here a violent activities when political parties are inviting\nThe far right fight club's to to speak at events into ... appeared events this is the kind of sanctioning that makes these groups much much more dangerous and my concern is now that we're starting to see a so some enforcement actions taken that these groups have have had two years to organize\nAt and recruit and I I think can be a much more dangerous problem in our society moving forward\nMike German what about these allegations that some of the far right conservatives talking about this being a false flag operation and if you could explain even what that means\nSure a false flag operation is when somebody got targets a a a specific entity that will automatically cause people to think it's their opponents that have\nEngaged in violence I I think it's entirely irresponsible to be suggesting that and again only ramps up these culture wars\nThe responsible to be suggesting that and again only ramps up these culture wars are and would only encourage more violence in retaliation I mean one of the big problems you have after an event like this is not just all the false alarms\nUh and how easy it is it to trigger a false alarm if somebody wants to cause trouble\nUm by copycats and to the extent these groups are getting any kind of encouragement whether it's from the the figures of the culture war certainly whether it's from the government figures authority figures\nAre ... the chances of seeing an increase in this kind of activity I think it was a\nWant to go to the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh speaking yesterday\nWe have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats\nAnd it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass and\nSo far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this Republicans just don't do this kind of thing\nA professor ... when he sang have rushed on ... minutes\nWe have this series ... thanks for having me first of all of but it's incredibly irresponsible for folks to be touting\nKind of falls flat conspiracy theories especially at this point when so little is actually known about what happened and to suggest that doesn't pass the smell test them we're not I mean we're not sure exactly what that means um [noise] but\nWhat this does is it it does further a much larger narrative that suggests that there is some kind of deep states conspiracy is trying to undermine a President Trump and is trying to ultimately a really distant power individual citizens\nFrom Penn is trying to hold them only a really just empower individual citizens that and it's a it's an idea that a stems from ideas about the second amendment trained to be abolished essentially so that people can harm and defend themselves and\nIt really is you know that this is really part of this larger kind of right wing conspiracy theories that have\nIncluded things like pizza gate and ultimately a you know when you see a band\nYeah the the false a contention that a pizzeria in Washington DC involved a child sex labor a ring that Hillary Clinton was involved with and ultimately lead one individual to to go there to investigate and open fire so\nYou know these kinds of wild accusations that involve these kind of conspiracy theories um\nYou know they're they're they they do a you know have an influence on people in a lot of different ways of old fortunately not not necessarily um directly lead to violence or most of the time but but on on some occasions there do see a new seemed to be an influence in so words matter\nUh and especially people in authority positions they have more influence in so uh you know I think there's just a real lack of responsibility when folks are counting these kinds of a wild a theory\nI Want to turn now to a very big story here in Southern California the leader of the California neo Nazi gang the rise above movement was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles at the airport\nRobert ... faces charges of plotting riots inciting violence for his role and a range of attacks in two thousand Seventeen including the deadly unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last August\nThree other members of the group were charged alongside Ron do a ... Robert of foreign and Tyler allow were apprehended at the homes and tolerance Redondo Beach as well\nLao were apprehended at the homes and tolerance Redondo Beach as well\nA fourth suspect Darren ... is still at large the men are accused of participating in violent attacks as well as using the Internet to incite violence the head of various events that group publicly documented their attacks as a recruitment tool\nEarlier this month for other members of the rise above movement were indicted on riot charges so at the same time we're seeing one after another suspected pipe bomb on being sent off to a leading Trump critics\nPlenty of time recruiting and now that there are forces measures being taken it's easier for them to go back underground and be very strong in their in their ability to organize much more serious violence\nWell I Want to thank you both for being with us of course we're going to continue to cover this so we're heading back to New York today my German is a fellow at

weekly welcome to democracy now it's so for having me several so go through the left on a lot of focus more so than ever I mean this was definitely read country now is Orange County turning blue\nIt's a place where Reagan said all the good Republicans go to die and obviously anything wacky and horrible about\nRepublican politics in the United states came from Orange County you can even draw direct line between Orange County and Donald Trump and so of course there's gonna be a lot of attention paid can Orange County actually deliver the white or Congress to the Democrats and\nI I still am skeptical again born and raised here in orange county have been covering Orange County my entire up a career and so to think that we're actually at the at the cost of revolution I'm Still a skeptic\nSo talk about Dana Rohrabacher versus Harley road so we got to remember the ...\nTalk about Dana Rohrabacher versus Harley\nRoad so we got to remember the district and the main district split up between two cities Laguna Beach in Huntington Beach Luna beach\nBoth they're both on the coast both historical ah Laguna Beach is more hit me ... or whatever Huntington Beach though it's filled with a bunch of uh I don't know what if I could say it on the air but let's just say a bunch of racist and so\nThese are the people who have been electing Dana Rohrabacher for Thirty years and Dana Rohrabacher has been loving in his district all he has to do is just go on a surfboard once a year\nHe calls himself the surfing congressmen and that's it hardly route a brand new millionaire was a Republican not too long ago so that said a lot of people do not like the ... so this district really depends on how many people like him versus how many people hate him but that said\nI Do not discount the fact that the ... the people who like the inter are ... are are going to go out in droves just because they despise anything that even reeks of liberalism\n... talk about the political culture in orange county why answer Republican Strunk used to be all\nAgriculture so used to be orange groves there's an orange to Orange County send them that's before the Nineteen fifties after the Nineteen fifties it becomes suburbia so you have to places where farming and development\nAh ... played a key role in the economy also yeah the defense industry so of course you're going to have a lot of suburban I racist\nComing in and they're the people who had the power structure forever and ever all of that has slowly been changing still big parts of Orange County that remain that way it's it's like the deep south except we don't have African Americans we have Mexicans and especially we're so close to the border so you just have a lot of races a lot of middle class racism just building upon itself again and again so the Republicans were able to\nBuild this political dynasty and that said the Democrats ruled Orange County as recently as the Nineteen seventies\nYou had Democrats in Congress yeah Democrats on the board of supervisors the problem with those Democrats ... they were all corrupt and they all went to jail and so the Republicans came in they're smart enough to not put themselves in jail but they're still dominating all the local races\nLook into came in there are smart enough to not put themselves in jail but they're still dominating all the local races in until now all the congressional\nRaces and talk about the thirty ninth district where it is a hero of two people of color who are running against each other Republican young can Democrats Gil Cisneros so that\nThere are enough congressional district is going to be north east Orange County so we're talking about Fullerton Yorba Linda also a little bit of San Bernardino riverside county is a that was some parts working class a lot of parts wealthy more importantly it's about a third Latino a third of white and a third agents are very much you want to talk about the future of Orange County everyone hated that it's into the Dana Rohrabacher a\nRace but that's the one that really shows how Orange County is nowadays young Kim to longtime staffer for a long time congressman ed Royce who's retiring because he knew he wasn't gonna when former state assemblywoman then lost then became a state assemblywoman again\nAnd now she's running for Congress ... another one of these are first time candidate once Republican now a Democrat became a multimillionaire because he actually won the Powerball a couple of years ago so young Kim she's the one with the name recognition to the same thing how many people hate young horse he Trump versus how many people actually like kill\nI Can't really tell you many people who really truly like deal because no one knows who exactly he is\nBut this process to be ... it's close all around but you know Cisneros says oh well known political activists and saying\nAnd I I've been here my entire life I didn't hear about Gil Cisneros until he announced ... yeah the people are desperately hoping praying that this can come to Orange County the Democratic wave can come to Orange County again do not underestimate the ... and the horrible nests of Orange County voters until election day\nI'm not trusting anything I saw this as Democrats all the time and frankly the Democrats they never expected to be here and that even for the past twenty five years and they had even expected hey maybe one day we could actually challenged the Republicans they'd be at a much better position than they are right now\nEven expected hey maybe one day we could actually chose
