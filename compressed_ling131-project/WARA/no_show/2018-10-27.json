Sorry I didn't hear anything we live in the game but that's okay we have many more to go and we are going to take that time and I just know it and hey James what's going on in the weather I woke up came out and it is raining\nYeah renting a first real a coastal storm of the season to lay and we'll probably have anymore these over the coming months but uh this one will be rain it's not going to be snow so that's the good news I guess preventing a but yeah the rain has moved right on schedule and we're going to have a centrally all day today\nAre the heaviest or the rain or is likely to be mid morning for mid afternoon now everything is going to be going from South to North so the heaviest or the rain now on the south coast will move through the greater adult or area or through late morning and early afternoon and then a little bit lighter later in the day and so the further north you are say Europe\nOr maybe you're heading to the Boston area today it will be a little later there\nFor everything but everyone is going to get it so uh I Know you're concerned about uh the Newport\nArea right Rangel two o'clock or so a heavy rain a forty five\nAn hour wind gusts up by five o'clock though there at the winds will start to ease the house so the later in the afternoon if you're down near the south coast or the ... the storm center which right now is ah right near Salisbury, Maryland\nIt's going to be passing of rights just about over us about midnight tonight so it's going to go from Salisbury, Maryland to or the greater edible area by midnight tonight\nAnd between now that is what we have the rough weather now are there is going to be the issue with the strong winds the leaves are still on most of the trees or at least a good Seventy five eighty percent of the leaves are still on the trees so when they get beat down by the rain they act like sales in the strong winds and we're going to how likely have a lot of leaves around that initially\nLike sales in the strong winds and we're going to how likely have a lot of leaves around that initially leads to clog storm drains so if you do have a storm drain near your house or wherever you live\nIn you know oh every year I Know that rain sometimes clogs well at the clock it that's a good thing because we're going to get up to two inches of rain by tonight that means any or grains that are clogged it caused massive a big puddles in the roadways\nOr so a lot of high low planting street flooding\nAnd that also because those leaves act like sales were going to have the leaves come off the branches come off\nAnd even a few trees come down because of the very soft ground we went through this last March when we had those nor'easter is of course that was in a different situation it was certainly a lot colder and some of that with snow but bottom line we're going to have again out scattered power outages across much of the area this afternoon into this evening now again there'll be spotty and isolated\nA bit with branch actions so it'll be quick to fix as I like to say but I Do expect a ... a few power on who's it's really the luck of the draw the rule of thumb is always\nIn this situation if you live in a neighborhood there's a lot of trees going through wires that we'll have power outages the extreme example is\nDowntown Adel barrel likely will not have a power outage because there's almost no trees around to fall on the wires and think about that it does make sense now good news for tomorrow Elaine and I'll have another update right after eight o'clock a little more extensive if you want\nA cause I Know you have some stuff coming up\nTomorrow mostly cloudy a high in the mid fifties but even peaks of sun not a great sunny day all to all the time but the southwest breeze will be a ten to twenty miles an hour today uh I'd say the peak of the winds will be around forty forty five miles an hour\nAnd again that's enough would leave trees to take down the limbs much better tomorrow I wouldn't call it a beautiful day but much better tomorrow and here's the good news and again I'll have another update Elaine just after rate right now it's still looks pretty good for Wednesday Halloween uh on\nThey have to re right now it's still looks pretty good for Wednesday Halloween a on a Wednesday with temperatures in the middle fifties during the day trick or treaters late afternoon will probably facing fifty three fifty four degrees which one you think about it for the last day of October is pretty good\nWow yeah I Know because everybody's so excited about Halloween so what are you going to be for Halloween Jim\nCharlie Brown I ever ever yeah 'cause I looked like Charlie\n... uh that's really great that I just went out and I got my flow from progressive costume and quick recently so we\nHaven't had an over the years away\nOver the years have you ever been on Halloween the old woman in the shoe\n... no no no no okay okay [laughter] I don't know I I but I Know it was sort of positive thing but with you with the shoes and everything else I\nRaise right yeah and that time I get to maybe next year [laughter] go again I have to have shoes first I don't have shoes right now [laughter]\nWell\nToday thinking of that and again I'll have another update right after eight o'clock or ... more like a you know\nGood water repellent shoes and closed today 'cause\nWins the lady that could be coming sideways obviously driving the raid into you know make sure you have your lights on obviously you you see the effects\nThis morning of the late sunrise until we set the clocks back next week and we're going to have these dark mornings here we are almost seven thirty and you look outside the street lights are still on right and that's because we haven't set the clocks back yet once we do next week next weekend or\nWe will have a little bit brighter conditions in the morning for a couple of weeks but a a real dreary situation out there so you want to be very careful again the worst of at the height of the storm in the greater ... area Providence is between around nine ten o'clock and around three or four this afternoon and that means that that's when we'll have the strongest wins in the heaviest rains okay\nThe stuff we don't know about me but that's when we'll have the strongest went to the W ...\nOkay well I appreciate you do not think yours doesn't look like it's going to be a great a great day to stay indoors and a ... D jays and watch a lotta movies today right\nYeah it's definitely a good idea what's a good look quite school food is a lot about that tomorrow in a way to the rustic or just up record\nGreat Jim thank you All right guys I have a few minutes so I before I bring Julie hall and I want to read some of the things so today is the eleventh artful autumn fair\nFrom ... Saturday and Sunday ten AM to four o'clock at bricks nursery this is one of the best shows ever honest to God they have arts and crafts really beautiful flowers and things like that and that is happening today\nSo today and tomorrow and a bricks nurseries located at Kelly boulevard ten AM to four o'clock so you don't want to miss that\nAlso a Canterbury chapel harvest festival is today from eight thirty which is going to be starting soon to three o'clock and they have all kinds of oh\nMy God I listen to this they already have their frozen apple pie is ready for the holidays they have pumpkins and face decorating entertainment Russell tables\nThey have a whole bunch of craft or isn't so much more so it starts at eight thirty to three that's a harvest festival Canterbury chapel and that's located at three eighty oneself\nMain street in outer borough one other thing that Julie ... oh oh listen to this the steam punk festival is happening in Arab world today and it's free from ten AM to six rain or shine and that's a good thing and it's open to the public held in seven location some of them are the Arab world public library\nThe admiral area and dusty museum where we are [laughter] that they have a teapot racing a lot of children's activities there's so much so much going on arts and crafts and so many\nThere's so much so much going on arts and crafts and so many fun things to do you'll see people dressed in costumes and oh my God so much more so that starting today at ten AM to six o'clock you don't want to miss that and on Halloween Night\nAt five o'clock listen bring the kids down to oh my God the unlikely story bookstore in Plainfield because uh mister Kenny is going to\nUm like on the thirteenth edition of diary of a wimpy kid book the meltdown he's going to be launching Jeff can you is going to be launching his book and locally here in Plainfield on\nOctober thirty first which is Halloween I Know but take the kids there five o'clock go down there and uh get an autographed copy of it and then go trick or treating that'd be really really great so um and if I have time I will read more uh one more thing I Do want to mention before I take a break and then I'll bring\nUm just different problems basically with the way the overall management or mismanagement I guess\nProblems basically with the way the overall management or mismanagement I guess I'm going to say the word of ... Ga so I think governor Baker and the rest of the legislature um [noise]\nYou know I really try to help fix that and you know I think it's going to take a long time and it took many years to to break it I guess or get into the the bad poor shape that it's and so we just have to pick away at it\nUm one of the most important things so for us here in outer borough is we need to watch very closely when they have those meetings\nAbout changing route and dropping um stations off the line\nBecause long would ask in particular is one that actually came up and long without that that that station right there that's where all the medical facilities that right you have to be ... like you know if I could pick out any you know little piece of genius at some point in time I\nI Want to remind people that it is important to go to those meetings and it is important to listen very carefully when they do talk about changing stations especially for Apple borough\nUm a lot of the people that you see living in the towers perhaps and also\nClose by to the center here\nYou know if you take that line off of their ... what are they going to going to be stuck out here and you know with no transportation so be careful of that right exactly\nWho manages the MBTA who what governing agency so you know I it's interesting I thought that the state man it's like they don't we don't you know it's it's it's as I was reading I was ... I was trying to figure\nThat out myself I Would probably say there is some Transportation Department that does it but\nI don't I think you know in terms of the [noise]\nFrom what I can see if it was an independent agency oh no you know like an independent kind of thing so I mean I may be that and and that's something like I said I Am just now looking into that that mice\nAnd that's something like I said I Am just now\nLooking into that that myself as to what kind of went around the governor step in if it's a question I have exactly you know it's the same thing that you've seen with the with the gas unfortunately when I and the governor step into these things what should the governor step and\nYou know and I know there's some logic that keep you know government you know we don't want to look like where the government you know step right things that that they shouldn't be stepping into so those are some interesting things that I'm seeing happening lately in Massachusetts is when does the actually executive authority of the state ...\nYou know step in right right exactly\nYou know it says you're that independently owned an ... they have their own CEO and everything yeah yeah well you know what somebody's got to be accountable well for sure and I I Do know that the governor is working and stuff I Do know there is some kind of steering committee good it's an oversight board\nSee that it's coming to me thank you [laughter] know that'd be great oh my God well let's get back to um uh some of the differences between you\nAnd a representative Hawkins yeah I think one of the biggest differences that I can say is you know I have legislated here Fadel borough\nBeing on the city council I've had the experience with a couple of different budget cycles\nI've been on the planning board you know I when you when you're on the city council you have to know everything I mean what goes on in the city from a very detailed level for taxes you know things I think that really matter to people the taxes um the budget\nYou know which department you know you deal with the schools you deal with the seniors all of the department's public safety all of the things that that operation we run a city so you know if I have experience with that and I think when you move up to the next level if you're just ...\nI have experience with that and I think when you move up to the next level if you're just legislating being on the city council is a legislative branch of the city being a state rep is a legislative branch of the state uh-huh so I'm just moving I'm really just moving up to the next level\nAnd the fact that I have that bottom line experienced that detailed experience only puts me in a better position to now be at the policy level right I mean when we make policy I'm going to have already have\nAn understanding of what happens when the detail level whereas you know somebody else would have to come back down and say how does this work how does this work\nUm I'm going to have a much better advantages of doing that now given that I'm\nStill going to come back and say how does this work because one of the things I did on the council is if there was something that I didn't know I Would go to the department heads when when issues came up about healthcare things for the short I went to ... you have to go to the experts you've got to go to the experts first\nMost importantly you have to go to the people because one of the things I've found is\nWhat looks like what looks like it's working on a policy level it everybody says oh my God this is great great program to working out fine and then you're really going to ask about it then you find out you know all the bumps and warts as to how there's obstacles to\nWrite and how it affects the general public to you know and that's that's really really important I Know that um [noise]\nI'll just do side by ... and then we have to take a break but like when the high school vote came up and everything I'm senior citizens were very very concerned and I'm Stan Lee the assess er was trying to work with the seniors to to try to do a reduction in that and I was talking to other politicians regarding the um\nThe seniors and like maybe doing a delay of taxes like maybe they could um [noise]\nSome subtle of equity type of thing where the equity in their homes could be used to pay that\nSome sort of equity type of thing where the equity in their homes could be used to pay that extra tax at some point but yeah it's very sketchy and I\nI don't understand that much about it I could talk about it yeah actually I I like to see a senior tax free yeah I'm interested in the tax free cell that was great and you know boy that would be really big that would be really break\nAll right we're going to hold you rate there if you have a question for Julie our number here by the way to teach and Thirteen twenty I'd like to welcome you to out and about with Elaine and we're going

signing away she's she's she's twenty we have you ever carbon calling back in and telling us something not so good today hey Jim\nYet yeah not the best of weather today later monitoring this now for over a week we've been thinking Saturday today would be the the day of the first\nReal coastal storm of the season with moderate rain now crossing much of the area\nA if we're going to really I Can't stress enough how you got to be out driving around they're going to be as the wind picks up a leaves are going to come up a tree there'll be wet leaves which can be slippery even walking or even driving but also a again stressed that I Can't stress enough we're going to have some clocks storm drains slowly resort areas where all of a sudden a big puddle\nWe're going to have some clock storm drains so they'd be certain areas where all of a sudden a bit puddles and again the worst of this will be later this morning to most of the afternoon when we got up to forty forty five miles an hour\nOn again that could take out a few branches are and also a that means if it falls on a wire then you get a power outage again they'd be very isolated and scattered nothing close to what we have certainly last March when we had widespread\nPower outages because a lot of that was due to\nMaine lines across the area feeding into cities and towns this would be isolated\nWhere one why are in a few feet falls down and then a few houses around it might lose power that's the type of thing today again about Ninety eight percent of the area should be fine ah the big story really is going to be also not only the strong winds but also the heavy rains\nWhich with the soft ground so against just be careful of that there's a lot nicer as we go into tomorrow clouds little son temperatures in the fifties and then one more minor weather system coming in especially Monday morning so we'll probably start the week\nOr many going back to work and school Monday morning with some light rain showers around a high in the fifties and then much better weather for Tuesday with temperatures in the fifties and a pretty good uh Halloween Wednesday in terms of the weather southwest wins\nAnd we might even make a run the lane at sixty on Wednesday afternoon the last day of the month obviously and then as we start November might start as high a sixty and then turn cooler late in the week maybe some indications of another storm for next weekend but uh let's not worry too much about that at the moment\nNow my heritage and so uh what is the way they're going to be liking me like his later on my nephew is getting married young kid\nI I Know it's a tough a ... report while I Wish you'd go I'm sure it'll go well and uh have a fun time but you everyone outside would be dodging probably winds up to fifty miles an hour Newport now the worst of that would be around two o'clock and then the wins will start subsided as you get towards four or five\nThat would be around two o'clock and then the winds will start subsided and as you get towards four or five o'clock\nA and eventually the rain will probably in fact you're out this evening across much of the area seven eight o'clock a obviously a Saturday evening many people's still out I Would in about\nA will probably be seeing winds of like five ten miles an hour at most and just mostly cloudy skies with maybe a sprinkle or a touch of missed and that's about it so as bad as it's going to be a much of today\nAre much of this evening will be fairly quiet now we may be having a clean up in some areas from a branches and things but in terms of the actual whether this evening a things will dramatically quiet down as we go through I'd say seven or eight o'clock\nAh it won't completely clear out certainly but a lot quieter in the weather department by the way there was one still can you believe tropical storm in the Atlantic Oscar\nBut as we like to have fun with the names that it should be a winning an Oscar winning storm because it's going to stay out at sea it's not going to bother anyone except shipping interest so that is a good deal or in that regard minute a quick way to remember the today's sunrise laying it was at seven eleven\nIsn't that something my God so naturally we turn back the clock so yeah it would be that the clocks back yeah so it will\nBe a little lighter again in the morning so like right now or you look outside right now and it's still kinda dreary but it'll be more everything will be an hour earlier so I Will have a little more light in the early morning for a little while by the ... the sunset next Sunday a week from tomorrow will be a quarter of five\nWow mills in every year we go through this and yeah today is that\nDay is a classic example of just before we set the clocks back then ran out of having the dock\nWith today's sun sunrise was at seven eleven and with a thick cloud cover a the sun above the cloud just having a hard time so that's why\nAnd with a thick cloud cover a the sun above the cloud just having a hard time so that's why it's still a few street lights are on even at this hour after eight o'clock so I'm real nasty day today kinda dreary as you said if you don't have to be outside to kick in and watch movies or what have you\nGood luck to in Newport and have fun down there but I Will be windy or in Newport certainly as I'm sure everybody does\nUh usually when you're down near the south coast than than it is an adult but everyone is going to have a rough weather today the price we pay though although not a sunny day tomorrow a lot quieter and again just a chance of a shower\nRight thanks a lot yeah I Know it's going to be sent his team fifty mile an hour winds at two o'clock that's the way that's again yeah yeah\nBut again this is the what we deal with as opposed to getting a thunderstorm or you know like we had the other day with this with a strong winds that they may only last five or ten minutes and it's over we're going to have about a good four to five hours\nPicking in later this morning for most of the afternoon of every few minutes of having wind gusts between forty and fifty miles an hour and again the further south you are from Adel barrel down towards a safe Fall River\nNew Bedford a into temperature and also say down towards war what you're going to be in that area that's where the winds will be the highest in\nThe listening area if you're going to be up said north of here say up and maybe you're going up in the ... area or inland uh that's where they won't be quite as strong a wind but everyone is going to have to deal with\nOr at least some strong winds and heavy rains and I can't stress enough ah besides having your windshield wipers working well and the lights on or be careful of wet leaves that will be blowing around on the ground which can which was sometimes as bad as ice walking around on slippery wet leaves that's going to be the issue this afternoon\nOh that's a good point I never thought about that actually that's a good point that actually\nHad car accidents over the years blamed on wet leaves believe it or not as much as we have you know hydro planning a big puddle and you can ...\nAs much as we have you know hydro planning a big puddle Gore I wrote\nA foot wet leaves a comes in up up near the top this time of the year just before the leaves come off the trees and the closer we get to the month of November which is one of our stormy month\nThis was a classic example today where are the trees can come down easier or branches couldn't come down easier because the elites are still on the trees mhm once only wants to leave come off the trees and another few weeks then you have a you need a stronger wind\nTo knock them down because there's no leaves to act like sales so again a wealth afternoon but I'll end on this little lane is always it gets a lot nicer tomorrow\n[laughter] well I have that to look forward to and we're all staying overnight it's great to have family together you know as a fun I've gotten so you don't have rocked back in the bad weather you know that's good oh no way a very very late night that's for sure so do we all took rooms down they were going to have a\nThat oh the victim and and this is out and about with LA nice to know that she's gainfully employed [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI Love that song that's so nice like that as we thank you so much okay we're back in Studio ... with Cary below our number here five week\nTwo two two Thirteen twenty carry why don't you continue our conversation\nSo uh as I was mentioning before of having this conversation with an individual who did the first ... commitment our talk at a at a learned to cope meeting and he's an addict I'm you've been in recovery about three years and he said it was probably one of the more humbling experiences he had\nIt was hard he's like I've never been to one and I'm sitting in a room with parents and loved ones who are talking about and sharing about their struggles and it's it was very bright a very different perspective for him because he realized\nThat wait a minute\nI'm In a room of people were I was the source of their struggle not directly but you understand 'em but he also said he learned a lot from it because it allowed him to get a better perspective of what his loved ones must have gone through and it also allowed him to share his experiences\nOf hope with others and I think he he definitely\nExpressed that it helps them to stay on track ... constant reminder of you know what the consequences are not just for them himself\nOf you know what the consequences are not just for them in South but the folks around them\nRight right and I think that um it helps heal from what I've heard of what I've seen what are people that I've talked to that have been directly impacted by their children [noise]\nUm one person said you know I spent thousands and thousands of dollars on my kid and recovery and hoping that he would quote unquote get it um but then when they don't and they failed he says what am I just do he's my son\nYou know so they're always going to be there and you could just see that the the look on their faces of of they blaming themselves the parents of blaming themselves when they they really shouldn't and um it's just so hard but I was talking to someone\nEven here on air um because there was something about um the amount of drugs that are being prescribed to patients when you do have an injury or something like that and um and I'll give you a perfect example of myself\nUm I had rotator cuff surgery John on one shoulder and the prescription um and I I took two pills so actually coat on\nAnd it just I just didn't like the feeling of it at all and I put them away so six years later [noise] um [noise] I had this move in incident to house and I'm going through all my toes and getting through all the stuff and throwing out stuff and I came across that bottle and you know how much you know how many pills that\nDoctor prescribed no I'm Seventy five [noise] wow\nActually I'm not surprised and I'm actually turning those end today to the big apartment because it's like ridiculous it scares me when I see that I thought no I didn't like the way that it just numb Jew you know I just didn't like\nNo I didn't like the way that it just numb Jew you know I just didn't like the way so I guess\nThen fast forward like two years ago I had my other shoulder done and it was just four percent that's it yeah and then and I only used to and then they had extra strength Tylenol and ice lots of ice and that was it because I don't like that feeling\nSo um it's actually I Love to hear your actual\nStory because it it's a perfect example of the direction that not just the commonwealth but the the nation itself is taking when it comes to to prescribing um I think that\nThere was a lot of unfortunately a lot of trial and error with the use of opioids in prescribing I think at one point in time it was you know without the research and understanding the bigger side effects die right doctors were OK with prescribing they thought well we wouldn't want that person to feel pain right here is this something that I'm prescribing I feel comfortable doing and they\nThey can't predict when they write that prescription the susceptibility somebody has to being addicted or be using that medication and you're right\nSeventy five sixty I've heard I've heard of that a lot and one of the we had recently had a greater opioids symposium out fuller I'm In which we were honored to have\nA state rep Denise garlic who actually wrote the new opioid bill for the commonwealth that was recently signed into I'm into effect in July\nAs well as um additional state reps the mayor um my CEO Rachel and some other folks who were able to come to um talk about the different aspects of the opioid crisis now what does he feels a new field that's been introduced well\nThe new legislation it's a it's\nFocusing on how to address the opioid epidemic specifically in the commonwealth were preventative Lee and also in terms of ...\nMake Demick specifically in the commonwealth\nWere preventative Lee and also in terms of access to treatment um there's a lot of different\nUm pieces that are in play and a lot of moving parts um and a representative garlic took the opportunity to\nKind of highlight key um key factors and key changes so one of the things you mentioned before um when we first came on air and was the medication assisted treatment and that um some people call it and that's methadone Suboxone zone\nThat's that's the general name for any sort of um alternate medicine Mitt medicinal treatment to compensate for an opioid addiction\nUm and also there are medications out there to assist with on alcohol addiction as well they're on which\nIf you um take this medication and you were to drink you become violently ill so that does exist on though it seems kind of weird to think about but at the same time some folks I totally understand the premise but um [noise]\nSo one of the things is where they're just trying to expand upon the medication assisted treatment model as um something that is utilized a in a warm handoff and utilize a little bit more often in the emergency department [noise] setting and that's the impression that I got from represented garlic\nSo um we're ... instead of treating a overdose or a addiction um incident in an emergency department by just handing out somebody off to a voluntary treatment or handing them a piece of paper or should I say that says you know here are your options\nThey are going to work more with trying to initiate the medication assisted treatment in the hospitals and then warm handoff too\nThis is a treatment in the hospitals and then warm handoff\nTo a um a patient provider and the community uh-huh what is your sales right um well we don't personally prescribe um we don't we're not a medication assisted treatment a provider which means you know their clinics that are dedicated to methadone and Suboxone zone\nSo went in and they are providers we will initiate in some cases in our in our in our impatient units where we are medically necessary will initiate a prescription for medication assisted treatment but then we ensure that there's a provider that keeps that go unseen thing or a psych med right you come in\nOn say you're in psychiatric crisis you're only with us for a couple of days to a couple of weeks or so we are going to stabilize you were going to change your meds\nBut the doctor that attend a T what our hospitals are going to be your doctor throughout the year we do a warm handoff to either your current prescribe or we help find you a new a prescribe or in the community uh-huh so same thing with medication assisted treatment so we don't have a clinic but we have relationships with\nUm with providers for our patients\nThat is really great so it's a really great partnership that you have absolutely do you think that doctors have changed it a whole series of this crisis on sixty minutes recently and there was one doctor in Florida that's in prison actually because he's prescribe over six hundred and thirty two thousand pills a month\nAnd the DEA came in and said what are you doing he had a pain clinic he had several pain clinics and he was really over prescribing and people were selling drugs on the street et cetera et cetera\nSo I think that um education with the doctors they had legitimate doctors on and they said well you know what when I'm a drug rep came in we really didn't understand the addiction part of it and how powerful how powerful this drug laws\nAnd part of it and how powerful\nHow powerful this drug was he actually coat on when they first came on the market they didn't realize like the um the hyper addiction component to it versus something else you know and um so\nI think that educating the doctors to have 'em have really come into play too I think that the physicians need to be more educated about the\nAddiction I think that now because it's out there now that you know so much publicity is happening\nNow that it's out there that so many people have died because of this um doctors of being more responsible and in a less prescribing being more cautious and then and recommending like in my case you know just for ... that's all you need I think you just need that but I Want you to take these because you're going to be in severe pain which I was\nI think forty eighty dollars as something silly it's absolutely ... it's almost like they're being forced to have to\nGo in that direction to keep themselves medicated quote and quote so wow that's amazing I Know we've only got like six minutes left I Know our time has gone by bill have you have I'll have to have you come back in December because we were talking about the seasonal disorder or something\nI'll have to have you come back in December because we were talking about the seasonal disorder and the and I and people suffer from the very greatly but um you have so many things of the support groups that you're involved and I know with the police departments and\nAnd a local support groups why don't you give out some of the the locations and days so people can know and also your contact information\nOr at least so a fuller along with the ad about police department pops team that problem oriented policing team\nAnd local agencies run a we rented dropping center resource dropping center a once a month here now to borrow at five oh five north main street which is the Murray Unitarian universal is church\nAnd that's the typically the last two Wednesday of the month from five thirty eight and it's open to the community and we absolutely print promote and expect in honor anonymity from folks\nUm what is our job and then to look like it is you walk in and there's a series of resources from support groups such as learned to cope you could actually talk to a learned to cope facilitator I'm about meetings and about experiences uh we have a nor kept lodge new hope ANC\nI'm full or obviously seven hills as ... training and they've and which you can actually be trained and receive free ... um and I actually they've recently started on this but also passing out at the drop in center medication disposal bags\nSo um you know you get a bag and there's um there are a there's a disposal process where if you put the medication and the bad there is a chemical on there that breaks it down it makes it like does all of its dissolving it but it it probably disposes of it and then you just those are the bad altogether so they have that\nI'm at are dropping center besides ... training the access of different resources in treatment we also have a model\nThe knock him training the access to a different resources in treatment we also have a model where we honor if anybody's in seeking when they come to us voluntary um treatment so if someone comes to us in seeking that\nWe'll have the capacity to be able to try to at the group I'm getting treatment that night and transportation or at the very least we follow up the next day and we've ... we've helped a lot of people get services\nReally the premise is and if you think about it at the time you know it's at night right it's on a Wednesday the premise behind is we're trying to encourage folks who have no clue where to start who themselves or someone in their family or friend is struggling to get resources but not if there's a stigma or if they're Shane or fear\nYou know we ... we try to create a very warm welcoming environment and again we promote anonymity we don't we won't if you don't wanna give us your name that's fine that doesn't mind can just\nOffer you the resources um that you need\nNow are there are large groups are small groups of the individual um compassion people that are reaching out to others or\nWhat is the group setting like All right so it's really um the setting when you walk into the room there's a series of tables around the room and it's\nIt's a unity room at the church which is in the back of the church you get a little hallway\nAnd it's a very warm rooms got a little fireplace great it's a very welcoming and so you'll see the tables we have our table cloths out and some information and we have a representative behind each table who's prepared to listen and to talk to try to help in any way they can and these are volunteers that are coming on and so\nThe the setting really is individual lives you can go from table to table there's like died when he first walk in the\nDoor who someone who will talk to you kind of get an idea of what you're looking for and help to to to guide us to where you should start a specifically the dropping center does focused on mental health resources substance abuse and use resources as well as domestic violence\nMental health resources substance abuse and use resources as well as domestic violence resources so new hope is there and we have folks that are trained in safety plan\nUm and we are actually having an education piece at our November twenty eighth dropping in which a representative some new hope we're going to be doing an open community conversation at a separate room at the church during the dropping center\nOn um safety planning how to recognize domestic violence and how to get a protective order wow no one is that going to be happening so that's November twenty eighth at\nSix thirty PM at\nThe ... church so when you walk in there'll be a room or going to have the education piece but down the hallway there's the resource center so folks can pop into the resource center if they would like and check that out or not it's completely upset on okay what we're trying to do is we have all these wealthier awesome\nResources around us so it's like this is a great opportunity for us to be able to showcase I'm the education and information and free and open community setting or\nNow a with just a second ago [laughter] are of\nIf people if a parent is listening or grandparents is listening and they want their grandson or granddaughter or family member to um get some help or maybe they need some help and support can you give out a number of the that they can contact foolish someone\nFull or so for at full or um you can

Smokey sleepy town mining its own business do you know doing that I mean it was just kind of cruising along\nThat's Plainfield talk oh that's where I go and play with them [laughter] and a plane [noise] and so I started\nA gaffe and we're the only to raise them I'll make it how noisy health\nOr Mr ... found himself a tinge offended at this did you or not because I mean I didn't say anything bad about no no you didn't it was just telling stories [noise] Mm yeah I didn't like it makes your wife said the same thing it's the tone of voice\nYou didn't like what but I just or because I was kind of\nOh yeah well you you were being Dave King and read it [laughter] you\nKnow the Internet that you very old they're excellent\nExcellent ... and that's the truth I [noise] and so anyway he complained to Peter and of course Peter called me into the office and I met run in the office with being called the principals are\n[laughter] really was a recession I that was my which I don't remember the only time in ... the only time in history\nThat this man apologized for anything probably you know I mean I think I probably I did I did when did you end up you know I didn't mean anything no harm I was just trying to get people who didn't know you and the people\nMan I was just trying to get people who didn't know you and the people and and even though you to start listening and I tried to tell you that every one in ... and they right that's right and there were four of them standing outside the building with science\nProbably listening to you and wondering what the problem was\nAnd how he really wanted to make something happen [noise] and so when I heard he was running as a write better I gotta do it again so I sent him a note this coming\nThrough ... yeah I I think that the if you're out there listening you'll do yourself a favor especially if you're listening and in Rhode Island where he's a candidate\nI think it'd be pretty impressive oh yeah yeah yeah you will you will because he knows his stuff and he's running against the plastic board what did you buy it right I Do know what I'm Talking about now I'm going to tell you or\nI should warn run uh we are on the radio show there's certain words we door while on the radio okay don't say the M word run the em [noise] don't you do to know what happened was\n[noise] [noise]\nDon't you need to know what happened with the er the debate the attorney general who absolutely I Do so don't owe who do I shouldn't say marijuana\nSo [laughter] I don't know the you know the marijuana I'd I I wanted look this up before I came in they marijuana has a base\nIs it an Indian or a or there's some kind of\nDeal where it's supposed to be a you have to say ... it's a religious deal I mean it is for his opponent the the opponent the guidance running against\nNeuron a neuro to excuse me I'm stormed off\nThe debate stage there's no real use the word marijuana because he said it's um where he kept trying to equate it to the N. word and I don't know what that was a very yeah he did and uh when I went well this guy has his he's he just got busted he and his wife got busted\nFor having tons of marijuana row and that's part of it's part of the church yeah they have a church preacher yeah and marijuana is the basis yeah for some reason that holy saying yeah because I can say believe in it they believe in it and the and he told the judge told the judge even ... I asked the judge please use the word\nCannabis it's offensive to me and I know that is\nSo well yeah but you want this when you're a candidate you hope you have your own it's got to be so why\nNow listen you in fairness you have to have missed the Gordon come here that's his name he can\nBe really high all the time right I mean well I I'm not obligated anymore you offer it\nYeah you're not you know you you had to get them I think you should offer him and I'll I'll pledge to be here because I I'd like to meet him oh well yeah say oh yeah the only thing is we've got to tell them smoking in the studio and feeling\nYeah yeah\nThe only thing is we've got to tell them to smoke in the studio concealing route or like the question that would be but it would be funny if you get an interview and eat smoke it up in the interview was suddenly becomes friendly\n[laughter] you know I thought I\nDon't know I mean the fitness maybe he's a friendly guy holy night seems like a ... ... people who who\nMay who knew marijuana are usually pretty mellow yeah pretty much yeah they don't you know\nThey're not it doesn't you know that there's a there are tough drunks or you know but\nThey're only Kelly pot smokers so it yeah yeah\nSo that was that was that as a fit in their own energy for the way of introduction to the next part of the show [laughter] so so talk to me now what what did you bring to the table\nTo talk about what did I bring to the tape yet I I mean 'cause I don't want to just run this whole thing I Want you to decide what you since about no no no I went when I\nSend you never want to win the whole [laughter] somehow I see how yeah I Know but I only I usually like guess to\nGo wherever you want to go in and I don't follow the new stab them that well [laughter]\nWell let's let's talk a little bit about all of these ... people and solve the Dorian ... you know around march through Mexico my doors are locked\nThat's it I I Know they're sending down the the troops troops\nI think that Tom Perez put signs in their languages in ... in that country saying come to America come hell yeah you'll love it it's going to be great and they don't know any different 'cause they would trust it\nThat's going to be great and they don't know any different 'cause they would trust it and this is what's happening that's my ... well I don't think there's any question that the immigration issue\nWas one of the major issues that he won the election on right mhm I think that's a sensitive issue for people and and rightly so I I mean I don't\nI'm\nDisagree that it's a concern\nBut\nThese thousands of people who are still maybe a thousand miles away from the border you know\n\nI worry about sending two thousand troops down there they were already five or six hundred yeah yeah well that's what I learned I actually talking about a hundred and army mornings yeah\nThe endeavor interestingly I don't know if you know about this but the Mexican government has offered asylum I Do I heard that yeah the marchers yeah I Do know that there's a new well written earlier reported yeah newly reported and supposedly\nAbout Fifteen hundred have accepted the offer because the offer comes with\nA job wow they're offering a a job for how long I don't know they do have to settle into some areas in southern Mexico yeah\nUm [noise]\nHopefully that's going to be something of a of a victory and that's going to lead to citizenship a ... as a Mexican citizen again what the details are what we do right All right but but the concept is hopeful ... exact very how her yeah\nI I don't I don't get it I mean I just don't yeah\nYeah I I don't I don't get it I mean I just don't you know people that I have respected and light and thought were pretty good people\nThink this guy is his right I I I I just I've never had this experience right now neither have\nI or join you in that and I never felt this way about a president I was born during FDR's yeah really yeah this is the first time that I have felt the way I Do about our president well I've been saying for well since he declared\nAnd ... and started talking that ... this is such a parallel to the Nineteen thirties such a parallel to this this coming to power\nBased on people's fears based on economic problems based on we're going to make these guys the bad guys ever they are and vote for me and I'll protect you from these bad guys and if I have to make up bad guys that'll that'll be fine too\nI mean ... if nobody sees this parallel I'm Joe you know all the markings of\nA short book called the prince by Mackey of valley mhm that's right and he outlined how you go about doing what Trump is doing yes\nExcept that well I don't want to blame ... valley because Trump doesn't read so ... you know so he's doing it without realizing well I I I Would hesitate to believe that he hasn't read it and you know why because it is\nA very very short okay yeah that's right that's right it is it's a it's a very short on radio it's hard to ... it's a yeah yo hey hey it's my turn out there it's about the ... yeah there yeah yeah\nHey hey it's my ... out there it's about this ... yeah there yeah yeah\nSo we ... you know over the course of two or three months I'm sure he could have gotten through [laughter]\n[laughter] well it depends on how much bathroom time so I think that's right [laughter] it's just astounding to me\nA really a October thirtieth a litter of it really is unbelievable I mean it's\nI I can understand how like I said people who I liked people who I I've got friends I've known for forty years and they and they're still still hanging with them I have relatives who support this man I Can't even look at\nI had friends who I found out would not like me if I was black surprise mhm\nAnd if they knew that used to be a guy that would [laughter] do you think well they said that they did this begin to killers this guy uh safeco there no ...\nHe he worked for a woman who was interviewed us this morning of ... and she said oh he was a very good\nEmployee was on time he did his job the people around here like them of course he did tell me by the way I Am a proud lesbian and he told me I was going to die and go to hell and I and I thought to myself\nIn this guy's working for you [laughter] I I well she didn't say she liked them she was just saying that he didn't go to war he didn't cause any problems except that he thought she was going to go to a movie and\nI don't get you know I'm a white Irish\nCatholic American I mean I don't get people whose history I mean Irish had a little bit of trouble not you know and in Ireland with the Catholic Protestant thing coming here Irish dogs need out apply yeah but I don't understand how\nComing here Irish in dogs need apply yeah but I don't understand how people like the Jews who have such a a an extended a life of of discrimination and and meanness Hara toward them or black people or Hispanics or Muslims and how anybody can say oh\nBut this this I Know somebody who every time I see him he says to me what's the sense of talking we're\nDoomed oh yeah no\nSee I that we're doing the up and I don't believe that I mean I that's the one thing I don't believe I've always had hope you have always been thing this too will pass\n... talking about is a highly intelligent person yeah yeah\n... you know what we're doomed\nBut that goes back to the argument we just we just had about education is a highly intelligent person but\nSomething in his core that he's ready to toss in the towel feels a impotent don't you don't you think that this president has one people down to the point where they have to go to ... I think he has no I think he has warn people down to the point where\nI think he has no I think he has one people down to the point where when he comes on on the news they don't want to hear and\nAll that yeah absolutely I Can't let me but how does that were done they did you hear that you feel that way I Can't even look at him yeah exactly but how does that work there that's not going to solve the problem no no but I Want to hear it anymore either allowing drawer ring\nFrom him and which is exactly what he wants playing into his his hand mhm yep I'm confused about that how is he going to host he's going to maintain his hold on them if they're turning off\nBecause they're not out there you know [noise] talking against him\nOh you don't know they don't know what happened last week I see what you mean yeah yeah I don't want to know anything about it you know don't tell me sick and tired I Am my cousin in West Virginia tell us about amateur then ... we'll be right back you know as a mechanic\nCompany you are welcome to join is it five a way to to to Thirteen twenty or jumping anytime when we tell ya\nOn October thirtieth at six thirty PM the center for reconciliation will host the hidden history of the second amendment a presentation by Carl T bogus a cathedral of St John located at two Seventy one north main street in Providence\nThis is a free discussion on the history of the second amendment and how it intersects with the history of slavery in the United states guests will also have the opportunity to learn from local organizers about gun control activism today\nCarl gee bogus is a professor of law at their Roger Williams University School of law he has written and spoken extensively about both the second amendment and gun control policy\n[noise]\n\nSki that\nMe down he what are you a yellow Booker ... well uh what are you doing\nMy new ... to ... get you remember me get you know it'd be nice you miss me who misses me even though ... for the trees and getting into the\nFood that you needed a grant you we um Mickey mom to pretend to force last year I misled Steven it took me a long time to get here oh I guess that makes sense ... that fire weight hadn't been today I'm sure you normally take\nYou're right I should get out\nHave fun puddles catch frogs they climb trees\nThat in your hand\nIt's an expensive venture mom it's to me we need to get I don't have you today\nCome to the forest where the more adventurous you let's check out discovered the forest dot org for cool places nearby brought you by U.S Forest service any I Can't [noise]\n...

I don't think that's what they meant when they said it's a commission at all I Know there's a lot you know however many 'cause I'm In no more than I Do [laughter] ah like I get a job to you about something seriously for one second I thought we'd been serious this whole time well him\nKind of I guess you and I share something we share the the loss of a sudden and and and Sandy do and I don't want to talk about this with you because\nThere are people listening I'm father's losing sons mothers losing daughters dads losing daughters I'm Talking to me about what that what that was like talk to me the ...\n...\nIt's you know trying to go back over those years of ah of\nPain painful mhm I mean\nPainful circumstances where you lost your son and I lost my son a different yours was sudden mhm mine was extended over ... ...\nAnd yours was sudden mhm mine was extended over several years uh I I Can't remember sitting with you I don't know if you remember this or in an empty room in the old studios sharing with you what I was going through with my son\nYou remember that I don't think I Do\nFor those who are unaware my son was a an alcoholic in a drug addict and it was the kind of thing that just didn't just happen overnight it it\nIt was over a long period of time of attempting to go into rehab come out go back in come out and not happens to be one of the problems by the way with what's happening with the opioid crisis and when when we you know I worry about the fact that\nWe use the term opioid crisis and we don't really understand how serious it is\nHow right now this year in this city we've already lost twenty four young people\nLast year we lost over thirty\nIt's the numbers are just so incredible it's hard to believe and when you pick up the newspaper and wild ... this is not exclusively true and you look at the obituaries in your whatever the newspaper you read and you see someone in their twenties usually male\nTwenty three years old and died suddenly ...\nCan I I look at that and then I can almost predict unless it says that he suffered from you know so you have some terrible disease which this is by you always have their own yeah see yes but it is it is at a point now the governor\nBut it is it is at a point now the governor of of the state last week said that the opioid crisis is getting better but it's beginning to levels off a little bit\nI'm beginning to level law which means we're only ... losing hundreds and hundreds or it could be thousands of you know we would get it with the yeah the way it was growing from year to year\n\nSo when you ask the question about how I feel about that\nI feel number one that we made a bad mistake\nIn authorizing marijuana because I Know personally that's how my son started I Know from my experience in education\nAnd in my conferences and I'll never forget being at a conference of stone hill college where they brought three inmates from the house of correction in who were there because of drugs\nAnd every one of them they first thought they were addicts by this point\nEvery one of them in very ... said that the entry drug was marijuana mhm that's where it started\nAnd for people who don't think that's a problem that alcohol is absolutely alcohol is the problem people say well marijuana is not as much of a problem is alcohol and maybe if it if that were the limit that it didn't go anywhere maybe that would be true\nWhat what are the problems one of the problems with what you're saying as I hear it\nWhen we dealt with marijuana very differently than we dealt with alcohol we deal with drug addiction very we dealt with drug addiction very different one of the ... the reason we're having a level of leveling off I think is because we're all now suddenly saying wait\nThe reason we're having a level of leveling off I think is because we are all now suddenly saying wait a minute people doing marijuana\nWe can get with alcohol you could get into rehab you could get some help you could ah go to meetings when people were on drugs a week and a half ago you know go in in our lifetime\nThey had to hide it they couldn't tell anybody you know they were afraid of of of exposing their their their ... their supplier because it was it was ... it was a whole bunch of reasons that we made that we made it impossible for them to be able to get any help before they got to the\nBefore they got to the other stuff and and this is why I've always been in favor of legalizing this stuff in order to do what we're talking about here which is somebody gets to come to you\nOr me or or elected official whoever and say listen I've got a problem I'm doing heroin I'm doing whatever and they can get some help\nAnd and and and we if we legalize it we can control its its quality if you will and tax it use that money to make rehab centers et cetera so she'll get smart about it as my thought\nRather than this what we were you and I grew up with was oh no that's awful it must be I didn't know what marijuana was when I grew up you know that well known young age well I'm Talking about just\nYeah that's that's part of it and you know one of a big problem is whether that was the ... problem now and\nThis is funny you know this go so far back ... members sickle cell anemia or sickle cell anemia was a horrible problem in the black community and they were all talking about it and nobody is do anything about it and then a white\nGuy got it ... and all of a sudden there were ... yeah and what's happened\nNow the parallel I'm just saying the parallel now is that you have people now we'll see ... describes a white collar worker middle aged guy or woman wherever they are and they're addicted to opiates because their\nDoctor prescribed all kinds of stuff to them but not everyone who gets prescribed stuff who takes\nNo no I'm Talking about the people who have will have the addiction than cats are exposed to over medication\nIs a couple of weeks ago there was a symposium down at full of hospital yeah\nAnd one of the panelists at the symposium was an emergency room doctor from Brockton ... and he said ... that doctors ... of the people most to blame for the opioid crisis\nBecame Missouri because you that you had a knee replacement you had to show the pain whatever they would prescribe you and and my wife went through this you had a ...\nPain whatever they would prescribe you and and my wife went through this you had a knee replacement I couldn't believe the number of opioid painkillers\nThat the ... and was like eighty I just add a lot and I went and had a little too thing ... nothing effects and the same thing I got a prescription I brought it home and joined said to hell us as always kill the horse yeah I'll say leave and and the acts and and and the the antibiotics too\nBy the way yeah way over ... and before we go any further I Want to remind people who are listening yet that today is the day where you can take your medicine cabinet and by the way young people who are addicted go to the medicine cabinet in your house and in other people's houses\nAnd steal those painkillers those opiates mhm to sustain themselves\nToday is a drug\nElection day ... just about everywhere and well in the city of battle barrel between right now and two o'clock this afternoon\nYou can take drugs that are out of date that you don't use any longer that have been there the giant jelly used to borrow it exactly is so do everyone in favor including yourself\nTo go to your medicine cabinet pullout all tell us things do well this is the way to do it\nNow but he said well that's what he means though yeah he doesn't support him I say I take all of those and go down to the ... the police station or whatever I think this is national by ... or if you're in North that overall the north federal people who'd be collecting or wherever you are even slept ville\n[laughter] they they do they do have a police department there do you have really good one yeah she noticed the cop [laughter] today's turned away luggage same claims are has a serious\nMan I did have turned away with a gun slang claimed who has a serious serious\nPolice department at their officers yeah take take the medications and take them to the soldiers least station there's a place to deposit them get them out of circulation and then when you're\nA cop pulls you over and he's on something [laughter] you you don't often ... there was just my attempt all in the seventies I live in these commission and\nI sat although worker and I used to try to tell the parents please you know your\nKids have probably gone into because I Want to hear them talking yeah and yeah the hanging out and everything you please don't leave shrugs and yeah and and Andy here's part of the thing we tried to originally with the with the\nKids here parents talk about all they get home I Need a martini mhm mhm I had to have a drink oh I'm going to take a couple of days I'm going to go to sleep I'm gonna I mean these kids have ... have been brought up us um and they these kids now I didn't I never drank I never smoked\nI never because I was lucky enough not to have that\nSays abroad but also to see how people were enjoying themselves also I mentioned this doctor he admitted that doctors of the greatest fault for what is going on with the opioid crisis\nA new bill has just been passed that the state level\nI happen to have have had a relative\nWas hooked on these things and because his doctor wouldn't give him added it drugs he would go to a different doctor yeah you get older the emergency room and he would go with him that he could get it yeah and there was never any way to cross check that this bill that just passed once it's\nPut in place you know and it's going to take some time to do it will electronically\nOnce it's put in place you know and it's going to take some time to do it will electronically connect all of these doctors so that when someone walks in and he's looking for this they can go on their computer and say I'm Sorry\nYou're already a trail you've over the place of science that will go the other thing is that in order to get an opiate\nPrescription now\nYou have to present identification if you want to refill it you can't just go to the pharmacy and refill it like to use do you have to go back to the doctor gets script\nThat

Rhode Island right now I say well I don't know it's interesting the issues I think she's leading right now they're not crazy about mystifying missed the phone is a is a big Trump guy I Believe it or not\nAnd um so that's that's been troublesome\nFor him and then we have um [noise] this guy um\nTroll ... and ... there's a story about true low when he ... me and many years ago there were a couple of teenagers and they were hassling this girl or whatever and he went out and were good things changed and\nUh he hit one of the teenagers in the head with his ... he was working with the ...\nThat teenager today is the speaker of the house in the Rhode Island say those and since then of course they've just made up or whatever it is yeah uh but I mean the stories and it really is\nI I'm only in Rhode Island you know I mean it was so small and everybody's related see that's that's what everybody thinks that the corruption Rhode Island is massive it's nothing is anymore\nYeah but he thinks that the corruption Rhode Island is massive it's nothing is any more massive anywhere else it's just so we know\nAbout it because we're related to everybody\nOh in Rhode Island does not make sense is that\nWhat you know to you know a ... view of a job in the government will say oh you need to do wow oh who sponsored\nYou Sam sponsored you huh yeah so I mean it's it's a very odd it's very odd\nFive a way to do two Thirteen twenty and I think our guest is here\nThe morning or good morning hello\nI'm Dave yes good morning Peter around high fee to how I Would just chatting about you ah thanks for calling and I appreciate it of course um first\nOf all I'm a Peters running for attorney general in the state of Rhode Island he was formerly the U.S a journey and uh when Trump came in he went out and that's how it\nIs a good sign I Know I like the red eye to eye Peter this is Donna Donna with me or show\nI like the morning voting on anything I so\nThat's how it works right I mean if Trump cut out in the present them and they just say by the way you're out of work\n[noise] yeah so typically when the White House changes hands of my party the U.S attorneys move on so my predecessor was five correct the appointed by President Bush in ... when\nPresident Obama a you\nKnow was elected I I was in the office I actually work for five as assistant us attorney and President Obama ordered me and then you're President Trump became president and appointed or not I think is the process of appointing his on his own person yes all of us are all of us to step down and and we expected that you know it was just I'm really matter of time in more than anything else\nAre you are at all concerned about the rhetoric that we hear about or did you just she'll system and the uh\nTurned above the rhetoric that we hear about a ... system and the the legal system here from our president I mean he's always jumping on me with the FBI and the CIA yeah um yeah what's it like to hear that\nWell I'm very concerned about it in fact I made a very quick trip to Nashville just over the last forty eight hours I'm to be a with a group called the former U.S attorney ... uh they're going to be back with a gentleman there are actually working the Kennedy Johnson administration as an assistant us attorney so these are all former U.S attorney some both both administrations\nAnd I remember the former U.S attorney from ah just yesterday from New Orleans Jim wet and getting up and and saying look you know\nWhether you're a Republican or Democrat\nUm you know we all have faith in the institution of the department of justice and this is the first time it's ever been challenge from the top I think that's very damaging for the country for the American people and very unwise by the president I mean the Justice Department the FBI have been institutions that this country\nHas counted on for very long time in ... in my view can continue to count on a but the president undermines is ... undermines that I Believe for his own purposes\nAnd that's very important I think that's very unfortunate\nYou know one of the things that has always been interesting to me is how they ... the Justice Department although the president of points the the head the department itself is separate right right it's weird I I Know he's laying out a little bit to\nSure so so there are ... what we would call political appointees which means you in the United states attorneys are political appointments appointed by the president\n... what's that in the Senate confirmation so my appointment had to be confirmed by the U.S Senate what everybody else so that that applies to the U.S attorneys it applies to the attorney general deputy attorney general some of the other very senior leadership in the department of justice I think it's about a ten thousand per se organist\nSome of the other very senior leadership in the department of justice I think it's about ten thousand per se organization you know we're probably talking about a couple of hundred at most maybe less than that that are appointed by the president\nIs probably less than that actually um [noise] so everyone else is a career employees they you know some some people move on other things but they have civil service protection and they're there for very long time and be the turnover in my office strings office\nYou know it was very limited I mean people would pretty much once they were able to get a job they're very competitive get you get hired there once people came there they they tended to stay until they retired for the most part do great work by but made it a career so\nYou know the department really only turns over the top and in in even among our ... us political appointees I never looked at the uh the job as a political one in fact I was like an unaffiliated voter as us attorney I didn't vote in primaries as us attorney and one of the public\nOr I Want us to the public to have no doubt that I was calling it right down the middle so you know we tried as we would say we tried to check our politics at the door or certainly the policy that the department follows the step by the president in terms of priorities for that kind of thing but the institution was respected I mean I worked for a Republican president you know I respected President Bush\nBritain erode thank you so much and good luck ... ... that by by All right\n\nI mean again I Know why\nSo much um\nMovie\nThat I did\nUm [noise]\nMaybe [noise]\nWhen you're reading died [noise]\n\n\nOur\nNew mayor on the radio 'til noon today and you are on the radio was well hello\nHow are you ...\nWell I guess what it's like you know I'm heading down a Ninety five thirty one in the fast lane blocking traffic all the way down so we think\nThere will say that in mind that again you broke up said again\nOh okay uh there's an accident on exits sorority fast lane get the one car that wall\nOr were you know where's the thirty were reciting by cell where ... ...\nAnd what a whiz exit Thirteen where is the five where now where Ninety five so there are any ya ya where where is exit thirty yet OK okay fine yup yup okay I think I think it I like very\nOkay good thank you so I'm All right thanks a lot of ways I think we have I I\nFind my way to to to Thirteen twenty yeah they've got a of\nAn accent and I guess on Ninety\nFive and a good place in Africa yeah I'm just I was trying to place at the age of thirty people a lot of times that I did traffic reports remember oh you're enjoyable that's probably why you get confused [laughter]\nBut I used to do them from a plane uh-huh and the thing is that um\nWhen when people say it's dirty and you're driving you you're not paying attention to it\nWhereas if they're just why I wanted to know where it is yeah yeah people got to slow down you know this weather between the leaves on side streets and the wind or on a Ninety five regarding the guessing is suing waters and not being able to you hit your\nYour windshield and all kinds of stuff going on you really got to slow it down yeah you got to slow down 'cause you will slide right into something as obviously happened on a Ninety five so\nSo I'm actually in ... that sounds good to see now that's that's good public radio\nAs good Rudy yeah yeah it is and we are glad she did that because now you can be a prize\nYeah exactly you allow for you and your car why you're not moving for a while\nYeah [laughter] yeah right yeah yeah well ... I I think it into\nAnd we've got to reiterate that you know you got to slow down ... you got to take it easy yeah and um and um\nYou you know you accidents happen there\nAnd you you're in accidents happen they especially happens when people um are allowing for the weather for weather conditions\nAnd still being on their their phones checking their lipstick and the review and the Arabs\nAnd the radio yeah and all of that working a shoulder yeah\nYeah yeah yeah yeah and so but especially today or I said it didn't look that bad I was sitting where I Am Jim carbon goals occurred to me and say listen you're dummy this is gonna be a lot\nYou know we're seeing like having where you have a a yes coming in yeah uh and then so people need to drive accordingly mhm I ...\nOr even stay home once I once I get home on my way back I'm going to stop stop that shot and then once I get home that's it I've got my which locks full you're\nIn the short power\nYeah do I need to know that yeah you're feeling\nYou tell everything about yourself which show us no one no milk in the long\nRun that lord Aileen you're going to by the way I can I mention this guy that\nThey've caught the bomber yes I forget the mentioned this earlier I think he's innocent\nI think he's innocent young innocent because of brain\nNo no no no no I think you know I don't think it can't be the person like every person who was attempted what three ... assassination of two presidents or no I don't think he's can possibly be guilty yeah well\nI ... well because he has no middle name oh yeah that's yeah\nAll all the all of the all of the the\nAssassins are generally and they've all gotten the middle names this guy sees a say go doesn't have any middle name so he's\nGotten their middle name this guy sees the Sago doesn't have any middle name so he's got to be innocent\nHuh that's what we think of it you think of what I found a little funky can tell you and nodding your head I thought you were green or you when I ...
