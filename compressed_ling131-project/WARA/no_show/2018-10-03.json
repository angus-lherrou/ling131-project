sixty two so again we please everyone I Know there are many that one still Seventy five gr many others with like a sixty two\nAnd others would probably want it somewhere in the middle and that's the way it will be for Saturday with ... and the mid sixties sunshine\nAnd then the Sunday back to the low seventies so again a Thursday tomorrow in Sunday's similar now if we go into the Columbus Day itself Monday the holiday looks mostly sunny and a little cooler again so Monday almost a little like friday where it cools off after a warm day\nAnd then as we get into next week Tuesday and Wednesday\nOr that's what I talked about yesterday a hints of at least eighty degrees for one or two days next week now that would be Tuesday and Wednesday\nAs the Bermuda high continues to be further north than usual all this is a a ... affecting the weather across the United states even the part of the reason why a that hurricane Rosa brought some rearrange the desert in the southwest\nI again they said for the most part thank you very much there and ah although we've had a lot of rain here\nAgain they said for the most part thank you very much there and ah although we've had a lot of rain here lately a lot of it has been at night which has been the lucky thing I Know it sounds repetitive he's been listening all the time but this is really critical\nOf this rain has really gotten into the ground and it bodes well for I think some colorful foliage but again the reminder even though it's Columbus Day weekend one it's early this year a matter of fact the earliest it can be\nIn terms of the Monday holiday and to uh the colors are delayed again there is color around but it's just slower start than usual and unless you were to get a hurricane or bad or just coastal storms or what have you with strong winds the strip off some of the leaves I still expect us some decent colors over the coming weeks but it can it will be delayed\nAnd as I joked about it earlier in the week it will be more of a Halloween viewing of the Foley is better than Columbus Day\nNow in the tropics we have Leslie has been saying now lately the lovely lovely because it has not bothering anyone it looks good on the satellite a lovely look from above\nIt's been out there for almost two weeks in varying intensity\nUh they've been monitoring this now are the big ships that go across the Atlantic from Europe to the New York New York back to Europe and even some of the ones a top out towards Bermuda have been a rough seas there although they've been able to handle it\nOn the great uh viewing of a big waves and Bermuda and even to a Canadian maritime have had some really big surf but again are generally are dealing with it in a good way because they know how to deal with it that is the only storm in the Atlantic there is an area that's still down there in the western Caribbean south west Caribbean\nAnd again I bring all this up because uh uh some people say who cares about what's going on in the Caribbean well you should because this is the time of year at the action picks up\n\nFor the last three days this low pressure now its way down Near East of ah Honduras and Nicaragua er but that still has the potential to develop move north northwest\nNicaragua er but that still has the potential to develop move north northwest and as often in the past we see these things up near the channel the Yucatan channel near Cuba Jamaica Cayman Islands\nOr that could be an issue over the weekend\nAs a developing storm whether it would be a hurricane still not set yet but something is going to come out of there and some entity\nAnd it could threaten the Gulf it could threaten Florida and in somewhat of a delayed state might affect\nOr at least threaten the somewhere along the south east coast at least of the United states again it of course the last thing for example a north and South Carolina would need would be another hurricane that would be the timetable that it possibly possibly could get up here would be around\nThursday or friday or even next weekend not this weekend but next weekend so that's something to consider and again that would be named Michael ... not might not Mickey Michael Straight out no operating name changes a letter changes dawn Michael would be the next one\nAlright well you got to see what happens next that's for sure\nYeah and again uh we have no worries here John outside of some clubs this morning\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\nListening to W.

went back to sunshine and cooler weather on friday highs and the low sixties loaded mid sixties on Saturday low seventies at least on Sunday then a little bit cooler back to the sixties on Monday costs Columbus Day and then Tuesday and Wednesday of next week we will begin to warm up again\nBack in the seventies and a couple of days next week we may actually make a run at eighty degrees which for many ... late season situation now we still don't get frost free so we can't call it Indian summer or other names of that sunset today coming up after about six twenty three so again though as much as we don't see a rise this morning\nWe have a shot at seeing some a peek a boo son going on in the afternoon late afternoon early evening and once again do we have that a shower thunderstorm activity there's a quick story last evening I'm sure you've made my guess is you might have been maybe just getting out of work I don't know but\nAh between seven and eight costs we had some downpours and even some ... one bright flash of lightning here in Mansfield\nBag or ... seconds ... you'll know why breaking this up no thunder at all in the rain all of a sudden one big flash of lightening I caught in the seconds and it was twelve that means it's about two and a half miles I just got in the scanner on three minutes after that\nAll of a sudden the scanner goes off the fire station right here in downtown Mansfield\nOr there's been a lightning a cough a lightning do smoke no fire and I'm like oh wow okay uh and they go there and they come back and they reported that there was no spoke no fire because there was no hit to the building but it hit their yard and hit a tree\nAnd it was all scorched where was it core band\nBut it hit their yard and hit a tree\nAnd it was all scorched where was it Corbin dry which is right off of what I was six right before you get to the eastern line how far away is that two and a half miles oh wow so and I could tell you know how you sometimes hear thunder dunks yeah in a lot of listeners ... and ... certain thunder sounds like it might have hit something ...\nLike almost like you hear the rumble event you kinda hear a second rumble this one was born and then boom and it was we're it's kind of interesting to know that what I was hearing I'm sure others that were out here in the center of Mansfield\nIt was bad hits it smashed the treat their a on a corporate and right but I took a ruler on the map\nAnd sure enough accounting ... seconds jokingly but in a fun way sure enough it was exactly two and a half or two and a half miles away from Mansfield center right on the east in line and it was we we had to know that that was the thought because it was only one there was no other lightning and thunder and that entire storm last evening\nOf the rain continued but nope just one big bolt of lightning and flat in the rumble of thunder\nAnd you ... seconds properly too and I I might go out to and a half miles because I was waiting to see if it was gonna start getting closer\nAnd I'm like waiting and waiting three minutes go by nothing and then you hear the scanner go up and somebody got a residence it was a one story residents encore Bain Dr they're right on the line\nAnd they were OK they was shaken up because it the lightning hit their lawn in a tree right outside the window and there was no fire just scorched it\nBut it was exactly two and a half miles away so that's that that rule if you use it right\nIf you know how to roughly ... seconds it came out just right but I'm Glad that that residents was not it because they were uh some lightning or a rare late season lightning and I'll end up this done one other observation I was making last night the last you might have heard the tornado watches and parts of Connecticut yesterday afternoon\nAlso New York Pennsylvania that was tornadoes\nThe last time we had a widespread tornado event here in New England\nTornadoes the last time we had a widespread tornado event here in New England in October was Nineteen Seventy nine the one that hit Windsor locks the airport the airport museum\nOr you might remember that that was October of Nineteen Seventy nine the reason I bring this up is because a lot of times when you have extreme oddities that happened you know we talk about in early snow fall usually means it won't be snowy\nWe Nineteen Seventy nine the fall of Seventy nine was a ... was kind of like this one it was warm\nUh we had a lot of late season warping September lake we've had now October we had a couple of tornado events in Connecticut that following winter Seventy nine and a and I mentioned this to before\nWas the least snowy is winter\nIn over a hundred years in southern New England now that doesn't mean it's it's etched in stone but it kind of makes sense\nBecause it was the first year of college in Vermont Seventy nine eighty a a lot of the ski areas where in bad shape they hadn't uh didn't put in snow making equipment until the following summer Nineteen summer of eighty a lot of ski areas put in their snow making equipment so the rule book so what I'm trying to get at is that could be a tip off\nA that this may very well be you know I've been thinking this now for the least the first half of the winter this could be a much lower than average snowfall season this upcoming winter\nOh that would be a nice idea that would be a good idea if we can go for it yeah it would be a not a bad thing to see less uh less a snow storms this year that's for sure we say that every year but that would be good\nSay I mean it's got a snow which never had we've never had a winter without at least one one or two snow falls right but uh that's that winter there was about eight inches of snow I Believe in this area\nOr in the entire winter compare that to the average is about forty five and a and again there was a bad winter too of there was only like two or three little two three ... a couple of two or three inch events and that was that there was nothing more than a couple of inches and that was a weather patterns similar to what what\nThat was that there was nothing more than a couple of inches\nAnd that was weather patterns similar to what we have right now with the that that actually that tornado actually killed a couple of people there are just north of Hartford Windsor locks\nAnd so at the airport in flood plains that with just over and stuff that was in October of Seventy died the following winter uh just like the way it's been playing out this fall or was a no hitter you love this upcoming winter that's all\nIt's not a bad idea to think about that is such a\nI think a lot of people out I'll have another update next\n\nTo W. A. R. P.

I I I kind of felt like you know the Mary Tyler Moore show was was about the the center of gravity of feminism in pop culture all that time so\nIt was also the center of gravity of some of my load activities up my bedroom yeah\nWe don't have a nice but uh who could blame you usually wink wink nudge nudge say the more he was already ladies I Apologize we try not to objectify women on the show but when we do do it\nWe only do it positively yes we all do what he does write and negatively objectify women Paul tore bill Jay Dulles yo and dug green inherit the wind is uh opening this Friday night at the Arab world\nGreen inherit the wind is uh opening this Friday night at the Arab world community theater I Love the way you guys incorporate you know I mean we start [noise]\nUsually go to a show here's the audience there's the stage and never the Twain shall meet and so often it out of world community theater you incorporate the to use thrush stages you've done theater in the round and once again the audience is right in the middle of the show exactly whose idea was that\n[noise] uh it's it's just kind of been the way that we've developed a I years ago decided that I didn't like that barrier that fourth wall between uh it just it's I don't like an audience to feel totally safe\nOr because it because [laughter] it somehow to me diminishes the experience because you might if you're going to do that you might as well just watch TV [laughter] it's like when you go to the the big houses in New York or Boston and just sit up in the fourteenth balcony you need you know feel glasses just to see the stage\nOr what's what's the point of that you know I like you know we call a hundred people in our house to sell out\nOf so it's we grew up in close and personal I remember when we were actually in this building yeah in the back in ... somebody called and they said well I'm coming down from Boston I Want to make sure I get a good seat and I said ma'am there isn't a seat in the house it more than eight feet from the playing space\nAnd she said well how do you do that I said well come on down and find out there you go\nIt's the only drawback is is is a while you know have some actors or when they project especially a piece and tease there's a little bit of spin all their sometimes yeah it's all part of the extent\nTo bring a poncho I guess was already very old ... ... around ... yeah when I was the uh the reveling in this play or you didn't want to be in the first three rows [laughter] there's a funny thing about that ah when when we're doing this fall tour of all yes Hi\nI'm so ... when we do the interrogation of a of racial brown and and I\nWe do the interrogation of a of racial brown\nAnd and I I'm between uh the defense table and the witness stand and cakes gets up and he's got something to say yeah and I wear it off [laughter]\nOutside right on the side of the face just [noise] the Gallagher version of inherits away on now with sled Joe medic aid so mad at you\nKnow I'm your girlfriend Kelly talent are taught at home and told them is the director what went wrong in her life where she ended up with your girlfriend\nI I you know I I keep asking myself that question time and time again what's what's she doing with a crusty old so and so you know ... like myself and found was that ... know everybody has that ... so that's why some of the creative outlet exactly exactly\nUm but she's a she she opened her directorial debut we ... we wanted to do this last year in\nA in the last minute we find that we couldn't get the right so we switched over and we did a show called the boys next door yeah which is about a group home for mentally challenged individuals and that went over extremely well\nAnd I think that was a better show for her to sort of cut her teeth on\nBecause this show is twenty twenty three PM like that big and the show to cast as they cast a lot of people a lot of emotion a lot of sort of trying things out and see what works because our ... our space is not that big in our in our backstage are wing space\nIs is almost non existent so you're constantly trying to figure out you know who is going to stay on stage who's going to be in the town who's going to be and how do you manage it how do you move everybody so everybody is safe\nBecause we have stairs to go up and down and on and off the stage and you don't want somebody that you know in the dark twisted ankle that type of thing so it's it's been a big challenge and it's been in in in to their credit are cast has been absolutely stellar is suggesting hey you know if I Do this this way it'll cut down on the time and you know it safer for me to get off the\nBest thing hey you know if I Do this this way it'll cut down on the time and you know it's safer for me to get off the stage type of thing you know they've been absolutely wonderful and working this material and trying things Fifteen different ways sometimes if it needs to be done that way yeah who wants to see what works the best so\nWell I'll send that's Doug green or are you in the show or you just\nI Am not I do I handle most of the technical okay enough I helped design the sound cues and I are designing design to run the lightning\nFor it so um you're in charge of\nAnd if any of us have done any profession or community theater acting you know it's a wonderful experience to her ... performance is the one truly truly horrific awful festering of health thing\nIs the technical reversal which usually takes like about a couple of weeks before the opening they usually set aside about four hours for the tech rehearsal it only takes about Seventeen\nAnd a and that's you everyone must hate your guts where the burning passion\nActually for this one I had an out uh I wasn't actually there for that there was this past Sunday okay and I actually wasn't there for the technical rehearsal [laughter] so the guy wasn't there for the technical Russell and I had I had to stand in a\nGirl who young lady who's been sort of an apprentice of mind for a few shows and she did a stellar job and getting so we're we're we're still sort of getting a flow down for the show so there's not a lot of lightning cues and it uh so the night it was nice to just kind of go up and down to make to get that flow for the cast so\nUh now Jay you're you're you're pretty busy but you work for a living yeah you're a city councilor where the hell do you have time for this\nYou make time for us important and um my son Ryan asked me and you know yeah you know rice said to me is more places that we should do play together like same thing I'm like I don't have any time and then he's like you're at every rehearsal watching me\nOh you know what I've got nothing of this why why do\nYou know we try to and I wasn't a hundred percent sure if I was going to try out on the call she [laughter]\nWe try to and I wasn't a hundred percent sure if I was going to try out some on the call she what role do you want I put a dog you on a field the one of the name I put down on the call sheet or whatever memorable when Nathan Detroit\nOh they are that are so ask guy [laughter] so\nBut yeah so we ended up reading for it and um you know it's cool 'cause I actually have three scenes with Ryan and it you know it's something that we can do together and it's something that uh you know I mean I've been going now this is Ryan sports show I watch the show and you know people\nAlways Ryan place the place the student has to take the stand or no actually\nThat's kind of Hanrahan plays how in in the rye employees a hotdog um you know to me solve a hot\nDog got another story for you as the most part yes and\nThe whole thing so it's ... you know he has a has a lot of fun doing it um but it's great so I follow all of my family fall in love with a out of our community theater and\nYou know putting on that city council half for a second you know people are always talking we need more downtown well we have yeah the arch literally in the downtown district you know so people need to come and check out the shows 'cause\nAs a Doug said you're getting quality Forman says you know the pauses we call ... are absolutely amazing yeah realistically\nAre twenty bucks a ticket not four hundred and Seventy or exactly yeah exactly and you're right there so you're experiencing\nThe entire thing right literally right in your lap almost you know it's just I we have to mention too that are Jay's lovely like Amy is our producer all the producers so when you asked before about family his entire families involved in this in the show and there's nobody to invite\nNow [laughter] and that helped family relations or hurt them a little bit on the you know it's\nBeen great cause any brings his whole level of organization and she's meticulous about the details and it's great\nWho meticulous we can't hide anything I Can't I Can't slip anything in out of the regime\nIt's great and who meticulous we can't hide anything I can I can slip anything in out of the rocks you say hey I'm the balance sheet and and another benefit of that is um by the time\nYou all like pack up and go home after rare so you're all too tired\nFight yeah exactly so you know [laughter] we'll get to ... just one second I Want to learn a little bit more about your background but your son plays the hotdog sales yes okay so you know we've all had this dream if you're involved in theater you've had the dream it's opening night and you don't know your lines right is that happened to and\nYou're like I have I have to theater dreams actually one is among stay I mean I have an active years and I used to ... years ago\nBut a mine is is that message and I have no idea what the show is what I'm supposed to do or or anything the other is I'm walking down a long hallway and I have to go to the toilet really bad [laughter]\nAnd I finally find a bathroom and I go in and I dropped my pants and sit down and then I realize I'm sitting on a toilet and the giants stage hall it's packed with people of all [laughter] so do I\nA couple of things a couple of jobs I ended up doing improv oh yeah I'm with\n[noise] a couple of things a couple of jobs I

is done by my judging two thousand six it was made it a comedy what happens is the U.S army\nOr in an experiment needs are the most average soldier in the entire army unremarkable in every single way or that character ends up being played by Luke Wilson and they're testing experiment with basically they they free somewhere to put them in suspended animation\nFor for X number of years the experiment goes horribly wrong and I'm Luke Wilson\nX number of years the experiment goes horribly wrong and I'm Luke Wilson character doesn't wake up until they see the five hundred years later two hundred years later and um what's happening with us now\nWith social media with all this computer stuff was is every generation\nKeeps getting dumber and what's really happening right now on planet earth and they don't mean this is an insult it's just way way it is the poorest least educated people are having the most children and that's at the beginning of the movie um\n[noise] the a wealthy well educated\nAre having the fewest children so with each generation society keeps getting dumber\nAnd we've seen that come through as we now live in a society dumb enough to install a professional con man legally as president of the United states though in two thousand six it was a comedy now in two thousand Eighteen it is a documentary and here is that Terry Crews who plays the president\nIn the movie a Terry Crews actor for NFL player\nAnd the host of next well whatever I'm says he would love to bring back his iconic character president Camacho from ...\nTo talk about the end of political correctness in America here's an interview a brief interview a couple of minutes or the Terry Crews gave about his portrayal as a former ah WWE wrestling champion and now president ah Camacho\nLast we talked a business around the primary over on the\nYou know there there was there was this taught that you judge the director ... we're we're going to try to bring back Camacho and do something like when you're a big thing was you didn't want to kind of throw job than just one person yeah we know who that person is but you know where you wanted to kind of be the field and and they didn't work out that way\nWe wanted to kind of be the field and and they didn't work out that way\nBut now that one man is now in our [laughter]\nSpeaking of Donald Trump so\nHave you started all of bringing Camacho back now that now it's just now kind of one man\nI Would love to make a movie or a literally want us to Mike and I were talking about doing like a chronicles of Camacho you know what I mean as we all know where it started it started in this area right now [laughter] I'm at because what happened is is the\nAnd it really is um a tremendous scripted it is so so relevant for today or encourage you to see that\nI'm so glad we did the interview but it did kind of break up the momentum of the of the first hour your favorite fake president out there so you can still add to that a women's music's request we can get to that as well uh ... my cat uh was one of our requests Wendy oh\nBy the ...\nWendy ... or by the plows Maddox was another request we might try to get to that as as a well I'm silly movies you know we've talked about that what we started today show put down the remote who he's one of those for us Carole and I is Dave\nAbout Kevin Kline having to uh pretend pretend to be the president I'm gonna let us into our whole your favorite fake president category but there's another category of movies which movies that who's getting home aren't great movies\nBut boy they're enjoyable and from my youth or one of them was\nCannonball run yes and uh that's in the ... that's in the news again it was back in Nineteen eighty one\nWhen Burt Reynolds than a whole bunch of other celebrities hit the big screen for no other reason than to have a good time and make a box office score with cannonball run a saw it in the theater I have never ever seen it since and I still remember a bunch of scenes\nOf yet the Italian gentleman someone's car breaks down or the Italian gentleman's car breaks down\nSo he gets into another a contestant and the gamble rallies in their car\nAnd the first thing he does is rip off the rearview mirror\nAnd Italian driving what his behind Jew does not matter ... there goes the mirror [noise]\nThink my father also drive drove that way as well but that's a whole nother story anyway uh the plot of cannonball run was simple get a diverse group of cars and drivers and race across the country for glory and cash but get this the movie inspired\nThe real thing and it's happening again very soon on October twenty six a few dozen exotic classic and super cars will line up to take part in the real cannonball run rally\nCars will line up to take part in the real cannonball run rally this year's run which will launch in Las Vegas and the roots of been chosen by select group of planners scouts and drivers once on the road\nThey'll hit some of the most challenging scenic and fund roads the west coast has to offer including stops in Bakersfield pebble beach San Francisco Napa Valley Portland, Oregon and finishing off in Seattle on November second would they secrets stop on Halloween\nHow do they know what's going to finish on November second what if someone gets to Seattle before November second I don't know sounds cool All right well it is but if you want in\nYou've got to pony up twenty five thousand dollars for the privilege yeah rich people only need apply Brett Kavanaugh you can enter this race huh oh wait you can Brett Kavanaugh when two hundred thousand dollars in debt [laughter]\nBuying tickets to the Washington Nationals baseball games which is another one of his many lies he's two hundred two hundred thousand dollars in debt allegedly I have to say from gambling debts betting on sports\nNot from attending Washington Nationals games wow so I guess ... wouldn't be able to afford\nEntering this race maybe that's one of the reasons he so desperate to lie cheat and steal in his way to the Supreme Court [noise]\nConsider that empty your pockets that deeply twenty five grand gets you there Dr stays in luxury hotels gourmet meals card ... car detailing and acting like a big shot on the road for a while\nFor that money the organizers are also quick to point out that this isn't a race or rats it's not a race\nYou know that this isn't a race or rats it's not a race well it's not a cannonball rally then this isn't to race but merely a road trip and they batch of high end motorized eye candy that includes lamborghini's for our race but Clarence\n... and more so do pull up in a Honda and one more thing there's a police escort every bit of the way so that is completely different than the real gumbo rally that the real gumbo rally was an all out let it ripped\nHere we go race race if you want to catch a glimpse try hanging around the Pacific coast highway that week what week oh the week of October twenty six\nI'm you'll see them whiz by at some point what's the fast is you've ever taken a car to fastest you've ever driven a car for me I was in

state college on four Ninety five and I kind of notice\nThat there are no other cars around I mean like none none\nAnd I'm getting coming towards a downhill spot and I just wonder I Wonder how fast this car can really go and it was kind of his face stretches for any five there was no one else around and it was heading down hills so just as an experiment\nI decided let's see how fast we can get

the way Kevin I just saw the other thing you sent me\nI'm\nA ... uh where is it here I've got it we were talking about how uh The Simpsons\nOr when Doonesbury was looking for the most ridiculous person possible to be president of the United states\nSome point in the late eighties early nineties they picked him our current president the patch will enjoy and cheap 'cause it's far it's ridiculous the country I mean we're pretty stupid developed country but we never be stupid enough to elect Trump president so we are we were um and The Simpsons\nAlso had episodes I Believe in the nineties where where you're you guessed it I'm Lisa Simpson becomes president the president after Donald Trump and Lisa has a huge job because of Trump's policies destroyed the economy and she's got to fix things\nUm and then we're talking about a can of all run which again is not a great movie nothing close to a great movie but it's just fun movie we enjoyed the heck out of it when we went to see it that the white cinema I'm white cinema of a movie theater\nIn a ... nine there right there and ... and actually they couldn't shake 'em and river right before you wanted to west or you know\nUm

here at Thirteen twenty W where outright and all over the world or W. A. R. Rated radio dot Gov that's ... three six you know I we disagree about yeah\nOh ray radio dot com actually ... three six you know I we disagree about him I'm right you're wrong but I Love your sense of humor and you had some killer killer contributions today with both musical requests on women's\nUh music only Wednesday and do your favorite favorite fake presidents let's go to the phone lines at five oh wait two to one three to zero good morning\nMorning I got a lot of stuff you know I'm OK referring residents are I'd probably say the ... oh actually from a fashion off of ... and when he was trying to talk that kid down from the or is that what state trip you know\nOh that was funny I'm gonna have to look that up yeah\nNow you mentioned you you asked me when I called up before about um\nIf I had any questions on how to win I don't have a comment okay because uh a guy I work with it was a born again Christian\nUh I had a conversation with him a few years ago when the plane of the apes we we both movies came out yup and he said he wouldn't see them as we move on to like see that a whole lot evolutionarily model you know that of the senators\nAnd that's an H descended from the common ancestor and I said the truth you may only\nHas that has nothing to do with that I mean it's like a fantasy a lot certainly desirable fantasy of all worlds that justice and it's actually the reverse of evolution the full somehow a training age and they become intelligent takeover said yeah but I wouldn't even want a bottom level I I Will get hold of as ... as long as you keep your mind is not always possible\n[laughter] what else to deal with I\nSaid I I ... and I also sort of like you know I I'm not a big champion of slowly because of those movies because they will find when I was Fifteen but when you watch\nThem now they're pretty they're yeah anyway yeah but I'm sure you were talking you mentioned ...\nAnyway yeah but I'm\nSure you were talking you mentioned making battery and you know that was kind of Ted Williams free throw shooter\nYes Rick Barry of the Golden State warriors won a uh NBA tunnel I Believe with ... I'm Sorry a BA tied to with the Oakland folks and an MBA title where the Golden State warriors and he shot his followers shots grainy style under hand\nYeah and he had like ... much better than Ninety percent shooting percentage at some of the guys I think like Clifford Ray\nAnd the ... the other players on the warriors also shot that way or by a a a ... kind of Rick Perry's coaching and counseling um but what I was gonna say was Rick Perry's or Ted Williams of a\nFaithful shooting and I think Brett Kavanaugh is that Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee follow me like oh you have a I can grab them by their by buying a I can get some drunk and had my way with on\nSaturday cetera you know what I'm going with this\nI oh yeah but at least not in Trump's cases Trump's own words mean Kavanaugh's case it's other people's words that Christine Blasey Ford ... of his classmates in high school and at um yeah I guess you know it isn't Kavanaugh's words in some ways his written words under zone year book pick\nUp those kind of kind of back sat up and then the more that comes out the more it seems likely that ah these accusations are not just actors\nOf course they're true of course they're true check out in today's daily ... to the op ed page a disqualifying performance ah that's by Nancy a gardener a retired federal judge and a professor at Harvard law school and it goes into all the reasons he's unqualified\nOf excluding the whole kerfuffle with Dr Ford all other reasons and then a Renee grams article Brett Kavanaugh superiority complex\nAnd then another op ed we like beer too I\nBrett Kavanaugh superiority complex and then another op ed we like beer too I encourage you to check those out\nAnd those are reasons why he's unqualified above and beyond the whole Dr Blasey Ford thing where she is telling the truth one hundred percent and he is lying like a rug but that's okay he's done it his whole life and he's you know comes from a rich white gifted family so we could afford it\nWere a senator I wouldn't vote for him just because uh I don't agree with his show philosophy you know that a ritual stuff it's just to me it's like an excuse to ingest a roll back the clock and or doing nothing about changing anything that needs to be trained\nYes when Native Americans were savages and black males were three fifths of a human being and black women didn't count at all well we were happy than what we were we now\nI don't even know why why they why they want to roll things back the way they do because\nThis is the white man's last stand that's the whole point of make America great again it's make America white again when only white males matter that's the whole point of the president of the Trump presidency it's not economic fear\nIt's racial fear Whitey knows that by two thousand forty Whitey he's going to be the minority in Whitey ought to be worried considering how Whitey treated minorities when they were in charge\nWell that is one of the points you know the point is of course a colossal ego trip but I just want us all in one more thing of moving on to the issue of females singers or what what was the exact term you use\nA women's music goalie wedding as day

symptoms of alcohol use disorder\nIt comes with psychological signs as well as the physiological dependence\nUm and and even just looking at and there are a sign such as rose Aisha or reading of the central areas of his face um this does not mean that we can diagnose alcohol use disorder but\nUh but they certainly point to the possibility also drinking that has been done at an early age and heavy

he suffers from it and whether it's it would affect his functioning\nAnd are you meeting would you just came from Washington recently\nUh recently yes I was invited to a speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment a immediately after some concerns that were raised\nA after the un press conference as well as um\nUh there was the letter in the New York times by and an anonymous White House official and\nA and a Bob Woodward's new book a\nSo for various reasons I was called by the Aspen Institute to speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd we're going to get to the twenty Fifth Amendment in a moment you are part of this movement um called duty to warn and if you can explain or you started it if you can explain what that is and how you feel that's relevant and judge Kavanaugh's case\nYes ah it's it's quite parallel to the concerns that we've had about the president in fact uh when the president was about to\nA issue or\nNominate the Supreme Court nominee we issued a letter to a Senate and a house members expressing our concerns about the signs that the president was showing of you know a lack of\nA capacity to make important decisions and and so we actually thought that it was\nIn judicious to allow him to nominate a Supreme Court nominee as well as to make important trips such as the Helsinki uh\nHas to make important trips such as the Helsinki a meeting and\nNothing really came of that that was actually a different group a group of prominent psychiatrists and myself\nUm but in terms of a duty to warn I Know there's a group out there that took the name and ah and call themselves duty to warn but but it came out of my conference which I organized a year and a half ago at Yale University yes that's right\nAbout the ethical question of\nBasically the the professional responsibility of the importance of restricting what we say which uh has revolved around the Goldwater rule with respect to a public figure\nAnd are suicidal responsibility to educate to promote public health\nAnd to warn when necessary and we came to the conclusion that there are instances where we do have a duty to warn in fact in psychiatry we have a duty to warn and a duty to protect\nWhen it comes to patients and the same should also apply with respect to society because the editor ethical guidelines make clear that we have a duty to patients and a separate duty to society um\nIf I may I'll I'll explain a little bit about the Goldwater rule which many have heard of a it has been\nAdult traded in a sense tune to mean prohibition only but ah the original Goldwater rule actually falls under the principle that we contribute to a the improvement of the community and the betterment of public health\nAnd so it's actually a mandate to act and actually know Goldwater rush the Goldwater rule came about because uh the psyche\nWas the the Goldwater rule came about because\nUh the psychiatric profession was embarrassed during the Nineteen sixty four Barry Goldwater campaign for presidency [noise]\n...\n...\n...\n[noise] [noise] I\n...\nYeah the [noise]\nThe so so\n... ...\nThe\nThings that show\nDid and then\nI have a\n\nTweet deception by Laura Gibson here on

market is professor of public policy and public affairs at the University of Massachusetts Boston founder and co chair of the urban research based Action Network we welcome you all to democracy now\nAround I Want to begin with you and posit that issue I'm Brett Kavanaugh and many of his supporters saying why are you going back to high school he should not be held accountable for his high school behavior\nEven at that involved the attempted rape that the allegation can you talk about what is happening to black and brown children not just Seventeen sixteen and Fifteen and it was a young as four years old in school\nFood and Amy thank you for having me on um I Would just say that we don't have a policy problem in public education we have a values problem\nThere's a belief system that is rooted in the hatred of black and brown children that fuels education policy just think that parents are the key you had to fight because her son was being suspended in preschool\nI've seen this story over and over again in Pittsburgh parents had organized to stop the suspension of kindergarten through third graders\nI'm In New York this has been a fight in Chicago young people fought to stop this uh stunts in Bay suspension Chicago public schools have the discipline policies are administered to live the hatred that\nThe discipline policies are administer through a lens of hatred that they that often these policymakers would not apply to their own children\nUm and that's why the numbers are around the suspension of black brown and white students for the same infractions so glaring that there is a belief system and and we know research says his first\nThat are that are black and brown children are viewed as older than their white counterparts\nSo I think we have to challenge that\nAnd not just challenge that I'm strictly around discipline but also around just to starving of neighborhood school I'm\nOut of the experience and the journey for justice alliance or across the country a black and brown schools not having pre K. services half\nDay kindergarten or not having libraries no teacher aides in the building overcrowded classrooms but then in the same cities their white counterparts having a completely different experience\nNow when we don't have any acrimony towards those babies that happened to be white or wealthy having a you know the things they need but the fight should be to make sure that all children have what they need not punish those schools will be star\nSo along with the suspension policies the policy of closings are starving in the closing schools has had a disastrous impact in our communities across the country\nAnd why don't you go now to cast Shankar at John Barr hilly now in Washington say back out and talk about what happened chair child when he was four years old in Dayton, Ohio Ken\nAmy thank you for having me on a yes I began organizing organically or as a parent pushing back ah when my son was actually three um ah what is now known as a pre school to prison pipeline\nMy son was actually three um ah what is now known as a pre school to prison pipeline or as you mentioned and one of the things that I I did as a parent I'm you know not thinking initially that it was a ... a race issue or a class issue that I just question\nUm their their policies and practices or question what was the actual normal behavior off for three year old to be exhibiting in a classroom or some of the things that they you know would complain about was you know oh he has problems you know transitioning\nOr you know he's having temper tantrums and so what I what I saw was happening\nAnd began to realize that there was a a pathology seizing a normal childhood behavior of my son\nI then began to take a deeper look and I'm not noticed that he was the only black boy out of only two black students in a class of Nineteen\nUm and then just the overall a teacher representation or as well at the school was overwhelmingly why the administration was all white\nI'm beginning to put those factors together or as I began to ask other black women or black parents asked the\nAt the school if they were having similar experiences\nUm and so once I did that I you know went to my co founder of racial justice now professor for nearly a Randall 'em and talk to her about what I was experiencing and that was basically how racial just as now was founded in her living room\nA saying that we needed to really have a response to this to organize and began to shift and change policies and practices\nOf how I'm young people particularly black students and our families um were being treated or in the school at that time and so that has led to a deeper analysis and until just recently because of the work of working class a poor and working class black parents in the city of Dayton, Ohio\nUm students doing actions don't him around the school to prison pipeline and he was rewarded with becoming an education secretary of the United states and what's the real difference between him and Betsy device vouchers\nSo I think if there was no Arnie Duncan that would be no Betsy divide\nWe have to realize that education is too important for talking points education is that the education for black people has been a long way to combat\nA suffocating oppression and a way to build a future for our families and communities across the United states\nFor immigrant families it has been a way to make sure that children um don't have to live in fear and if they can build a future in the United states so we should be making policy that is rooted in sound educational principle life where Arnie Duncan says his children the universe Chicago last school\nThey don't have a metal detectors and left school plant kennel\nChicago left who they don't have a metal detectors and left school we have ten ...\nOkay they don't have overcrowded classrooms so I think that the devices doing what she's supposed to do as all through what right

other hand it's expensive here because everything has to be imported and a while the price of oil was alone now has been is you know very high go our energy prices\nAre the highest in the nation but argues to electricity per capita pretty low dose do eating in the winter a relatively little heavy industry and so forth\nSo I was thinking maybe Alaska and would be really expensive to where I spent a lot of money\nNow I'm guessing a lot of our audience is probably visited Hawaii writes pretty calm and I'm a little bit of a misunderstood place certainly believe just spin the difficulty of job you know they're the utility and providing power he wrote the islands\nCannot be an easy thing but maybe tell us about the island you cover in in some of the unique challenges that that terrain sitting up there in the Pacific ocean is\nShort so as I think most people know where a chain of islands and uh the Hawaiian lecture companies for free companies quiet electric power electric for electric right companies her all the island except for the\nMario electric than white liquor quite companies for all the islands except for the island of ... which is the wind up in the uh the ... in the north west states population disturbed by one of our republic do these islands of the white island for the most remote\nPopulated island from the world in other words were farther away from any ... any other federal violence on her\nAnd uh each of the island is separate electrical grid don't have any inner connection\nBetween the grits so uh I like a utility on the mainland and we kept calling and electricity from a neighboring grid or from partners that are for it operating system\nA trial and have to stand alone entirely self sufficient uh and uh everything we need to bring in Rome including the oil or that we\nUsing a PR most of our electricity still unfortunately has to be important so that that basic freezes because of high prices also are very small market we ever bottom and\nThe important to people or so you know relative to a a man on utility we're we're pretty small operation but we're still one of the biggest companies to Hawaii\nWill like me to the year very dense right we think about ... as an example\nYou can go in the early Mars to be very dense which I'm sure provide some opportunities as well what about the history I'm just curious and so when you\nYou are

hopefully noon gets confused especially Michael radio engineer right [laughter] [laughter] but um\nSo I'm thinking about we do a lot of shipping to and from Hawaii right there's good container service\nBut we do a lot of shifting to and from Hawaii right there's the container service the barges and so forth most of your movie ocean right\nRight and and almost entirely today it come from the west the west of us it comes to Southeast Asia and costs in the middle east\nA little bit of a of a of the Russian far east so our our sources are not of\nThe greatest in the sense that these are very volatile areas than one or more out in the middle east is you know south east Asia or prices are very high up for the oil is coming from Asia because ever since the Japan earthquake and and shutting down their nuclear power plants\nAre they used a lot more of the same kind of oil we use the price shot up in this house arriving at the time of the earthquake and they really they come down in the last six or nine months but we went through a long period of record high oil prices\nWill know that the U.S supplies of natural gas but also the oil and ruin would you like 'cause I Know you do long term and soon to drain in you know one early alone in the small market you don't want to be subject to some of the best solutions to do so in some of the U.S supplies\nBut we're not interested in using oil we're interested in eliminating argues have oil for electricity or and eventually vehicles as well we're very strong supporters of electric vehicles rate so uh we're looking now at the possibility of importing liquefied natural gas from\nProbably from Canada for actually from the United states well in any case North America which would be cheaper cleaner and\nA a more reliable less ... stores\nYou know good to be a good bridge you get to a hundred percent right\nExactly we're going to get to a hundred percent her new book by twenty forty five or we're we've made that commitment\nWe're going to get to a hundred percent or no or five twenty forty five uh we're we've made that commitment state law even before that we said we'd get to sixty percent by twenty or\nTwenty thirty twenty thirty right I'm Glad you're with your free stuff and uh you know we're on a path to uh have all of our electric generator ...\nAre you in good shape for getting to the benchmark the way\nWe typically are our original goal or leave them illegal are fiasco was a Fifteen Percent by twenty Fifteen or Twenty one percent as of the ... court in snow we're ahead of the curve now and we're going to stay ahead of talk and\nYou could say that the way we've done the easy stuff and it will get more difficult as we move closer and closer to a hundred percent\nBut we are determined to make it and we're going to turn to get us off of oil entirely for electric\nUh adult as much transportation as we can manage\nIt will get in touch on this later but certainly you reduced you reduce the use of just ... like the average build like ... percent that's a great place to start and then you start to make the investment as you said you're building there's stages there's low hanging fruit all of us\nBack Peter I'm ... years had a lot of gloom Andy I Can't imagine that it was easy to ultimately even bring all the most Hawaii how did that happen\nWell it actually goes back to the orange kingdom king David ... went on a world trip the actually the Thomas Edison in Menlo Park\nAnd saw the curse like fall came back to Hawaii and he electrified the power of Syria lobby power before the White House was electric cars so why we have a a a long history and he was\nThe White House was electrified so why we have a a a a long history and he was determined that his subject his people would have electricity as well so the ... electric company was formed about a hundred and twenty five years ago next year as the hundred twenty fifth anniversary\nAnd at first uh the the source of of of appeal with coal because that caught the ships that visited here we're bringing it using and when the ships of the world went to oil Hawaii rent to oil and ah oil is fairly easy transporter easy to transport it was cheap for a long time\nWe didn't know the the the greenhouse gas implications than or didn't understand them until fairly recently so\nFor a long time oil was perfect or it was a good source of energy because it could be used for electricity went automobiles arrived although the first automobile in Hawaii was that electric vehicles very quickly they became gasoline and and then when they get plane and they are an aviation arrived to get liquid appeal with very so the oil and made a\nReally sensible a fuel until about ten or Fifteen Years ago when prices became volatile and we have to understand what greenhouse gas was about climate change and when we began to see in these very radical fluctuation\nNow as you continue to get more efficient and migrate to these teen idols energy [noise] have you started to see a ... levels stayed in that either may be the\nOne we do need people to move in the early stages and you can do it you will certainly getting ready to pull you know have you seen improvements\nWell actually one of our advantages here we have the trade winds which will pretty much content continuously and uh most of the emissions of our plants are are blown off off the island in over the ocean\nBecause of our plants are are blown off off the island in over the ocean\nAs so I I think we have ... we have seen some very you know some improvement with a reduction of oil use\nBut we've always had a very clean environment it's very important to our tourist industry it's\nVery important to the people who live here so because the the trade winds carry away the emissions from land to the ocean or that hasn't been a problem for many years but now we understand it's not just to add on land proposition because it contributes to the global global warming to the total amount of carbon dioxide in the air\nSo while it does not affect their health directly it affects the health of the planet and that's where we have you heard her\nAnd you know I knew you were there isn't correct\nThat's correct nuclear ah\nIt's actually not allowed in our state constitution but nuclear plants are very large and I couldn't uh we need to keep our plants falling out so that if one of the pale is there enough other plans\nTo other generating sources to make sure your were reliable a and there's also you said the ... who is a very densely populated island and some of the safety implications\nOr you know the precautionary shaped implications just uh the amount of space you have to have around a nuclear plants and so forth would make it very difficult to uh to use nuclear here until you know as several out in the cops there so it's not part of our plant that's the basic\nFamous so with all the bags Tylenol to just pick up a bunch of clothes and food sense of relief effort overseas you know all that stuff is going to cost more to ship and if it gets there probably won't even be used at least I'm trying to do something that you want to help [noise] there was an easier way if you'd only cash the professionals will be able to purchase exactly what they need you know I never looked at it that way it's plain and\nSimple most efficient way to help them to really mount a smaller dollars gets some of them are even more\nOne of the things that inspires me for it\nOn suggestions from our ... we're making that even easier as we\nHave more than twenty four seven number that will record [noise]\nAnytime anywhere in the new right away\nThat boys are or what I mean there are even want to\nShow you what your guests\nStory we make sure that all\nThe other area we cover\nWe cover\nFor their room one night\nWhen he won by\nOur new listener line\n[noise] and\nDo what you're saying what am I going to talk about the legal things that have been there in\nHawaii and we are chatting with Peter Ross who is a senior spokesperson with the Hawaiian electric company Michael\nDid you get ... seven Nineteen\nForty one you are and then that will live in the sense of you are the men Peter\nYou I think near in Hawaii and you talked about how differently today and it's just wonderful always to look back we know that electronics are a lot more efficient so you how to use his energy on by what about ... percent I\nWell where if we're talking about electricity where ... percent renewable energy ... a gallon Hawaii because for snow heating or for example one little in the stock is a lot\nOf talking about air conditioning and and uh maybe I should mention protesting the drive the increase in air conditioning and one of them is ah computers to an hour and a lot of other appliance that generate within an office or in an apartment right now so ah and then you have to fill up the author because of the\nProtect the the your computers from the elements and then you need to air conditioned to make up for that and the other thing is we are now building homes to park the islands that are very hot\nOut on the west side of a lot of court apple and therefore those homes have air conditioning bill can get it\nAnd therefore those homes of has air conditioning built in beginning\nHowever the good news is that because they are very hot there very sunny and many many is that overall majority those homes have rooftop solar and in that area of the west side of the island which is very hot sunny there are a number and an increasing number\nOf uh of solar farm we just got approval to for companies to build more and more a relatively large uh require large a solar farm so\nThe air conditioning is driven by the heat but they eat a son\nAlso give us a lot more solar and that's been our biggest single advanced over the last year or other kinds of renewable take longer to get into place takes longer to build a wind farm\nOr takes the longer obviously to do other kinds of civility but uh people move in their own homes to put solar on the roof and they have we have the highest penetration of do a rooftop solar of any utility in the country\nThey do they need and then the new storage units where they can run into the grid\nYeah fireworks day net metered but we're just starting to get into a storage because\nUh you know very frankly we have a grid here that it was built up over a hundred years and it was designed for one way or electricity flow\nOne way from the generator up costs for now the customers generating self generating and sending them back into the system so uh we're we're faced with some challenges here that other utilities will face in the future\nOr people come here from San Diego gas electric civic guests electric and ah and Southern California Edison and many other places the how we are dealing with\nA very very high level of rooftop solar and it does present challenges no question that on the other hand it does deliver us of renewable energy it makes individual or their own energy creators for part of the day\nIt makes individual or their own energy creators her part of the day and uh it's a it's a definitely a good thing and it's coming elsewhere a fight we're in the vanguard currency that states\nWhich is a wonderful place to be and and certainly here in Rhode Island we're seeing more and more I just moved to an event at my house I have moved solar and is because a lot more common now one of the things that utility companies typically\nUm put up until you choose you know is is the new ... to put up an argument if they come onto than they're they're unpredictable rank delusional was blowing in the sun is shining you're in a little bit of a unique situation where you're renewables are probably pretty predictable\n[noise] well they are predictable but uh you know not our sunshine for example is very good but it's not like the Mojave Desert where they have one cloud a year\nOr so we still have a you know we do have weather moving through here we have rain showers to keep our islands green and we have the strong winds are bringing a brain cloud so uh we do definitely have the challenge of a lot of of Warren called ...\nWhich is solar and wind or that it's not dependable but we have to but our customers of course\nA insist on ... on the ... electricity\nBacking up that level of renewable energy is one of the challenges I always talk about four and we're trying to do it with for no holes in other words the waste to energy for example on Hawaii Island we have geothermal here on a ... who are using more and more bio fuels so are there are there are ways to provide\nFrom generation with renewable sources but it is a transition that we're we're\nGoing through and when we were around when I wouldn't I wouldn't get you about that\nI'm guessing as agree you're going to invest in your own story too it's too probably right that's\nRight we have a A R\nWhen did you shoot that's\nAll right we have or are you out or requests for proposals were about to hire a couple of companies to put in several hundred megawatts of a storage\nOr that we uh have uh the will enable us to accept more renewable energy and ... and uh because we'll have that that backup we're also very going very strongly into what\nWe call the industry demand response which is to say there too you know if you if you can either create more generation or you can create less electricity use sends a demand response is a way of temporarily reducing how much electricity\nUse our customer used by you know we encourage them to move their ... their use of electricity the times when we have an for resource get a lot of solar from about ten in the morning till about three in the afternoon\nSo if we can get customers to do more of their electric use at that time of day then we have a better balance between the renewables them to use\nA and that's exactly where we are trying to go we just open the project here uh we have there's a thing called the green interactive water here which sounds very very a nerdy but basically we're able to tell those water heaters or electronically now it'd be a good time to create more hot water and store it\nBecause we have a lot of ... oval energy on the system and then later on in the day when the solar is no longer presidents are those are actual you know they're in effect battery thermal battered so we're getting a lot more that it's not the kind of renewable energy everyone thinks so instantly like wind solar\nIt's not the kind of battery everybody thinks of but it's storing energy and and making it available for later used we're going to do a lot more of that\nScene when ... when the leaders need to eat in religion\nVermont one industry leaders they too deterred certainly in Burlington and the big states declaration and it's really ... you see\nYour utilities back in you know just like getting the dissent\nNear encouraging their emotions to then\nBe like a man whom battery storage\nYour shirt and I'm guessing that would be that might be helpful to you as well as you try to manage demand\nAt politically we we're beginning to encourage our customers to ah to\nUse energy storage in the hall or as I said we are very high level of real energy and there comes a point where it's very difficult to add more solar on some circuits\nSo ah the alternative than it would be for customers or a or some combination of us that our customers\nGather to create the the battery storage or whether it's in an electric vehicle or or air or battery an actual or energy energy storage unit in the hall\nThat will store the energy that they make on the roof tend to to attend to free and make it available from five to nine which is when our Pete Stark greatest demand\nUh they're pretty far along are looking at my ... all\nRight Peter thanks so much for being with us keep up the mood were one of them want to see when we get over there are those board ... solar farms in St Louis and then the then certainly um I'm really interested in the ocean energy on the DARPA renewable now

special but we have a very special guests today Roger ... is senior vice president of strategic partnerships and growth for the U.S green building council Roger welcome\nThank you for having me happy to hear\nRoger or what I'd like to do for audience or because the U.S green building council has a wide footprint of the big ... but why don't you give us a brief background of of who you are what you do and how you got to be part of us green building council\nGreat I'm very happy to do that I have a my background I'm from the New York city uh area originally\nBut was a real estate land use lawyer and entitlements lawyer in San Francisco for many years then came to Washington DC and worked for large real estate trade associations\nI was on the board the national board of us rebuilding council and then for a many years uh was was invited in to be the head of global policy of law\nOr where I uh kind of brought the gospel of green buildings too many countries around the world and many un related event\nAfter that I served for a few years as president ... the kind of shared his title with me and I was president for a few years and now I act as a strategic advisor to our new CEO mash Vermont Ishaan\nThat is a big part of what I Do is it providing strategic advice mega trends that are affecting basically our customers world and how it's going to change over the next ten years making sure we're relevant in the interventions we're making secondly I focus a little bit on my home towns a green building activity New York city\nAnd then finally I and heading up our or one of our newest initiatives among many of our interesting new uh types of writing systems but we have something in pilot cold lead for cities and\nTypes of writing systems but we have something in pilot cold lead for cities and uh that's a project that I've been I'm heading up globally so that captures a little bit about my background and uh what I'm doing now\nWhere you spoke of strategies a transit in one strategy that has a trend attached to it is the U.S green building councils top ten states relieved rebuilding\nAbout it may sound elementary or but why would the audience or care about this and what is the background of this particular top ten list thing\nAs you and you're listening or many of your listeners know you know part of the secret sauce for the success of of lead certification has been this whole kind of behavioral economics than the uh this competitive instinct to that of people in business have where sometimes they are\nNot um in some cases nowadays even focused on the actual environmental goals but they are definitely focused on being better than their competitor with the environmental goals and that's been a huge part of the success of market transformation portion of lead when it comes to the top ten list\nWe see that that plays on that same dynamic that same competitive attitude that cities in particular haven't states have\nFor whether or not they have created a an environment or economically and from a policy standpoint where green building is really promoted so what is happening is\nParts of the country or themselves competing they're competing for a knowledge workers to come they're competing for new employers to come to their area and one of the tools they have at their disposal when they are saying you know come to Illinois it is a place with a great a commitment to\nYou know come to Illinois it is a place with a great a commitment to the environment as well as economic growth and two jobs\nAnd and that threw up throughout the country that you have these regional competition so the top ten list plays into that and I think of business leaders from different areas are interested to see how their state lines up\nIn terms of this very objective criterion for progress on the environmental front it so it it's it's fine to read about whether a given mayor\nOr let's say she is saying you know we're going to be greener than any other city in history words are cheap actual signs of real uh activity certification of green space is a sign of real progress and I think people in business read that and they go boy it looks like\nSuch and such a part of the country is really really committed to this or it looks like our region is and they're interested in how they stack up the\nWe're going to take a break in a few seconds Roger just so you know when we come back we'll quickly talk about if you can touch upon how the top ten states and markets have changed over time\nAnd you you touched upon how it's driving the marketplace it will will expand on that and some of the other questions for audience so that they they know what's coming up some of the best examples of the pool but at the top ten list things have\nHave had with your in their states and other cities and towns Roger touched a little bit upon that I think one poll that that I've seen the news is the the counties that are surrounding Washington DC and Virginia and Maryland Bayer listed in the top ten I Believe\nAnd a beer cited as being sort of attractive qualities and characteristics to a a ... Amazon choose that one of those little tells as for Amazon's new second pick quarters\nSo we'll take a break and we'll get back with those topics in more thank you Roger\nSo we'll take a break and we'll get back with those topics are more picky Roger [noise]\nMore about the greener side of building with architect and the last game right after this short break here on the revenue will now network where being ability to make them\n\nNature's whereas the New England is most populous latex\nBrand these comics lose a play at all cottage perjuring cars furniture matters locations majors who has the eagles relief construction include them playing baseball how is the more common negative foundation bees next year's natural resources fully trust mattresses\nI'm going to provide some partially willing to give you a more rational review believing night's sleep ... you're encouraged her to Jim addresses\n[noise]\nTraditional light bulbs actually generate ... billion times see them in a life [noise]\nSwitch to Energy Star label\nAnd you'll realize just how much cash were burning through [noise] saving energy stage you money to learn more energy saver stuff go\nFaster than a speeding bullet more powerful than a hundred pound gorilla able to pack any home and I think it'll look pulling up where I Hope it's a delivery truck\nNotes on the urban moving from the front row or is it moving from a bad move he delivered the satisfaction quality wedding survey for Super Bowl called an eight hundred three hundred and thirty four visit harping dot com moving guy saving the oral from fab moved one\nOr visit harping dot com moving guy saving the world from fat customer at a time\nAnd now let's get back to today's fascinating discussion of designing for sustainability without vision for the future\nHere's your house architect from our skiing\nAnd us can forest used back in back with a great guess today Roger ... senior vice president of the U.S green building council Roger ... where we left off do you have some specifics you could touch upon and how the top ten list is driving the marketplace in particular\nPlaces ... and perhaps some of the best examples of what the rating system is doing\nAbsolutely you add a a touched on a ... in your discussion of future questions you touched on the greater Washington D. C. area\nAnd that's an area that encompasses in terms of the bill ... the the the built out areas the northern Virginia region which is very uh economically impacted by the DC area and then also the close in Maryland\nThe commitment of these great world class cities to world class infrastructure is something that\nIs captured in a number of these of in a number of projects that are being LEED certified and I think that in general\nWhenever the government is involved in a big way and is offering these developers and a related players something that is a value from the government they are in turn for kick in the early sense is that the development that has done the environmentally responsible and the fact that\nA lead has become a global standards so that makes it easy for them to push forward I shouldn't say it's always easy\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] this this is talk of the national emergency alert system\nThe system was developed by broadcast and cable operators voluntary

phones well received a message others will not no action is required\n\nA trend towards public private partnerships\nOh that's a trend toward public private partnerships and I don't see that trend\nGoing away anytime soon it's obviously a big part of the underlying assumption of the current federal administrations program for infrastructure and uh I think I'm moving forward or the city's themselves will need to focus on it or with greater and greater intensity\nBoring to take another one the last regular show Roger but when we come back we're to pick up on on what you just touched upon cities and news so ... we started off the top ten states for a lead a for green buildings\nLet's talk a little bit about how we'd for cities can be a catalyst for for many things and again what

vision for the future here's your host architect cans are skiing [noise]\nAnd yes it does me can force you back with Roger ... senior vice president for the U.S green building council Roger we actually you you edited this last segment are talking about a lead for cities\nActually you you added to the last segment are talking about a lead for cities\nHow do you see um top ten states for LEED green buildings and bleed for cities working and where do you see leave for cities going and growing into it how does that relate to the to the rest of the lead family of rating systems\nLet me answer your question by um by stepping back and focusing on the broader issue of of carbon or reduction and and and addressing climate change\nAnd in particular the uh the the degree to which cities throughout the world have become leaders in trying to highlight that issue and through there are urban planning and through their own smart city technologies tracking their energy\nUsing new technologies to uh to track their water use and to essentially sort of have\nSustainability need smart cities and the whole kind of digital revolution in a way that uh that can be very inspiring and very impact\nAnd I think that in the same way that states are competing to be and to demonstrate their commitment to a modern version of environmental one that uh is not just about a saying don't do this and don't do that but it's saying as we grow let actually try to make\nThe places where we live and play better than\nThe condition they were in before we began to to live there and that's what I think is a big part of the legacy of all these lead certifications I suggest a different place now\nIt's one thing to design your building to be green and that is of course very very critical but the next question becomes when you look\nAt what is the actual progress of a city\nWhen you look at what is the actual progress of a city in reducing carbon emissions then you really have to look at how is the city and the private sector operating those buildings and how is the city operating\nThe other aspects of the city's infrastructure are they doing it in a way that is actually measurably reducing the amount of carbon or in this case kind of energy use are they doing it in a way that measurably reduces\nVehicle miles traveled per capita in a city are they doing it in a way that reduces\nThe amount of water used per capita and these can be tracked and you can actually begin to put on the scoreboard how cities are performing not just in terms of the aspiration of their building but in terms of the actual performance of the buildings and then at a broader scale and this is what lead for cities is all about\nLooking at the broader performance of the city in terms of whether their transportation policies and their water infrastructure or their energy policies are actually making a measurable difference\n... the way I see in general a lot of policy trends moving toward performance based building codes and to to really trying to maximize the amount of\nOf ah flexibility that people can use in meeting a notch as building code but other laws\nProvided they can demonstrate that there is a measurable improvement in the core value that you're trying to accomplish so if you're trying to accomplish a valuable healthier\nCommunity ah one of the way is that that gets reflected in reducing the number of days where people where it's unhealthy to be outside because of air pollution and one of the ways you do that is by getting people out of their cars and onto electric bass mass transit and again all of this can be tracked and lead first\nOn July electric bass mass transit and again all of this can be tracked and lead for city is committed to the principle that oh when we can't manage what we can't measure and if we can measure as we believe we can the actual environmental out put\nOf these buildings and these cities then we can begin to really create competition at the output level forever the environmental movement is focused on input new policies new technologies output should be more fresh air\nMore a clean water last vehicle miles traveled a less time spent stuck in traffic Roger the actual benefits yeah\nRoger I was I hate to cut the short this because this is such a waiting for a conversation actually it's ... and just listening to and I really do appreciate it will will hopefully we'll continue this in the future and my last question Eric worry too you just answered it in the last words of that you are but you said over here\nKnow some of the guy I think the oral some customer at a time [noise]\nNow let's get back to an age thing that she has been banning steam ability with a mission in the future is your house market hands a large team\nWelcome back every one of the\nInspections yesterday Charles ... chief operating officer of new smartphone North America Charles as I said before the break let's start talking about smart flower itself I'm\nToo if I'm not adequately describing what this would look like because obviously people aren't seeing any pictures here imagine at\nHome where I'm at the white part of the Kony is sitting on the ground very stable I'm told to be in many different colors\nAnd the topic home you have essentially a folding thin on many different pedals or facets to this and that can in the sand\nItself rotates following the sun and tilts according to the NGOs some severe I'm\nCharles you why don't you take it from there and talk about if you if you have a better description of smart flowers or the way it looks please a nice contribute and I'm going to continue on with a oh you would describe is just amazing and wonderful a piece of manufacturing in design\nThat it was a great description you must be an architect I Hope so [laughter]\nI I find a A R fire when you don't have a picture available to you is about is on the far far was the inspiration for the smart far and\nFor ... for the smart flour and it functions much like us like a sunflower does accept mechanically and electrically as opposed to naturally\nAnd for those that are interested in actually seeing a smart flower but can't see one in person\nI urge you to go to the smart flower solar dot com or you'll see moving images and still images of the ... flower and you also see our contact information if you'd like to get a hold of us [noise]\nThe the the concept behind the smart flour and what we've I think could shaved is to have the all in one solar solution that would be usable quite easily both residential early and commercially\nAnd would be something that would be far easier to install\nAble to be moved and would maximize the limited area that you had for a solar ray in terms of production\nSo the spider fire has only twelve panels on it it fits within a fairly small area roughly about a sixteen foot by sixteen foot by sixteen foot cube if you think about that conceptually\nAnd yet produces a nominally at least two point five kilowatts and in a good son climate let's say\nA let's say San Diego is going to produce over the course of a year probably close to six thousand kilowatt hours which is the equivalent to\nA four to four and a half kilowatt sticks to raise that you might have on your roof or perhaps in your backyard or in an area next to your office building or your warehouse or perhaps on the roof of your warehouse so it packs a lotta punch criticize about as much punches you're going to be able to get that given the\nA lot of ... out as
