happened anyway a gym carbon now standing by with the latest updates on the forecasts here on this early Monday morning gym\nWell I'm a mostly clear early warning is going to transition to a mostly cloudy and scattered shower late morning and afternoon as always again the situation in this morning is the fact that we have\nA sometimes good sunrise sunset these high in mid level clouds was monitoring the last few minutes just enough clouds to cause a few colors and the sky but\nCertainly nothing or all that new to this morning the bottom line is though I was going to hang up and down temperatures this week we're going to reach about sixty by later on this afternoon\nLiterally out of the south south west tend to twenty miles an hour and again most of the showers would be later this morning and this afternoon to do this evening again not raining all the time but the few scattered showers wins again picking up tonight showers this evening and then breaking clouds late falling down to the upper\nWinds again picking up tonight showers this evening and then break in clubs late falling down to the upper forties will get windy for a time as wins turn northwest now if you're going to be out this evening it's still going to be quite mild back the high temperature today briefly could go a little above sixty say through about eight or nine o'clock and then start to tumble late that's why I said earlier\nYou have the windows open a several nights this week uh it'll turn cold late at night so make sure you close them if you want if you don't then you'll feel the wind in the morning like you will tomorrow morning temperatures tomorrow getting into the mid fifties so a little below average again with sunshine and oh that's good news and then sending clouds as we go into Wednesday\nWith highs and the upper fifties ahead of the front southwest wins again\nThe vet a strong front coming in Wednesday night now whether or not but we a shower too is really insignificant or would that the main story Wednesday night is is pretty strong Russia northwest wins this will be the coldest air masks albeit brief\nComing in Wednesday night and Thursday as I said earlier the wind

the wind chills will be down into the upper twenties at least a with temperatures factual air temperatures in the middle thirties so you think it's called this morning or at least cool or you can add a Fifteen or twenty mile an hour wind and\nThat's why we're talking about so autumn like wind chills if this were January we'd be saying that this is just the typical morning everything is you know what relative to what's happened recently Thursday or hide in the mid forties that's it coldest day time of the season coming up Thursday after recalled starting friday morning\nLikely to be our first widespread frost I fear of fear meeting and if you have plants out there that might be in rough shape of cold temperatures well keep that in mind will monitor it but right now I'd say our first threat that widespread frost will be friday morning friday itself\nThey are first threat that widespread frost will be friday morning friday itself a recovering commit hippies and again if you ... hours on Saturday Saturday maybe a little like today with the milder temperatures within colder\nMoving in on Sunday early indications are Monday of next week about a week from today it could be dealing with another threat at frost as a ridge of high pressure a built in so again do we have a few colors in the sky this morning maybe not quite enough clouds to run really bright colors out there but we still have a few\nMore minutes to go to the rule of thumb are usually the best colors for sun rises and sunsets is about Fifteen to thirty minutes before or after depending on sunrise or sunset tropics what

because up on the hill\nThirty five meanwhile Fall River only filled with about forty five because up on the hill they had a bit of a breeze bottom line\nA coal morning but we will warm up if you want to call it that but with a few scattered showers not raining all the time but I Will be dodging a little bit of rain or through early this evening\nFalling back to the upper forties with a drier breeze after midnight it's going to be still quite mild this evening or or just don't be fooled by the mile temperatures might want to close the windows 'cause like wanting the wind not only will be in the forties but it'll be a one about twenty miles an hour then tomorrow sunshine still a little bit of a breeze\nHighs and the mid fifties pulling back to the forties tomorrow night setting the stage the sun and clouds on Wednesday\nI in the mid to upper fifties and then much colder when coming in Wednesday night and Thursday Thursday morning again\nA cold is warning of the season in terms of wind and temperature\nOnly reaching the mid forties for high on Thursday again nothing too unusual it's just we haven't had a lot of it lately and then friday starting out prophecy in many areas in the morning should reach to the mid fifties right now a few scattered showers Saturday and Saturday a little like today\nFifties and then Sunday colder when the sun and clouds back down into the forties and next week we'll have to monitor a another front that could approach by Tuesday or Wednesday not a lot of rain this week but a lot of up and down temperatures the way it looks right now it's on Saturday at six oh three will have a high tide at one o'clock\nAnd once again a reminder the sun this time of the year now is really cooling down lowering in the sky\nThe main reason why we cooling off as we do every year this time just like in the spring when the sun gets higher in the sky each day we start to warm up through a this time of the year or the opposite and in fact uh the situation is that we're going to have this pretty much of the entire week one long range thing I'll throw this out for the first times on\nAnd as you know I always like to look long range of people are already asking what do you think's gonna happen around Halloween well again Halloween is still\nPeople are already asking what do you think's gonna happen around Halloween well again Halloween is still a little bit I'll go too far no exactly but\nBefore Halloween and a few days a few days before some of the long range tracts of setting up to something and it's not I'm not surprised by this laugh though I tell you the last couple of days I've seen around the weekend not this weekend but next weekend of some sort of a a storm that forms on the front\nEnd develops into maybe a major sub tropical storm\nA and it's going to move north and maybe somewhere off the east coast now for example this morning and I'll say this right now or if it were to ever verify we'd have a raging major coastal storm allow the twenty ninth maybe twenty eight twenty nine that we'd have to worry about which is just a few days\nBefore Halloween and all of the next couple of days will start to get into that Halloween time frame but\nUh it's surprising to see this because of the weather patterns so potentially one more sort of sub tropical ... threat of a storm somewhere near the east coast may not be purely tropical it does remind me of the season dominant you'll remember this\nYear we had hurricane Bob we also had a storm around Halloween remember that one\nI certainly do yes uh the they'd be all of Nineteen Ninety One\nYeah they did a movie about it though the Gloucester fisherman there\nAnd that was a storm that was sort of a hybrid and I'm seeing signs that possibly I I guess you know I like to throw these out early because ah it's always like well who cares and the next few days I Know what it is but long range what do you think\nWe'll have to monitor this now it's obviously going to flip flop but if it's going to happen this was the type of set up this weather pattern that we're in for the last two or three months you might remember that was the year we had hurricane Bob and then we had a strong writer on Halloween it with many people called it the Halloween storm it was near around Halloween because it was around for two or three days\nA devastating storm for offshore shipping a special\nBut we because it was around for two or three days a devastating storm for offshore shipping especially obviously\nThey move that ship sank a fisherman brown so again not to sound negative on an empty note but uh it's not surprising that we may threaten the east coast may be threatened one more time\nOr maybe into the first day of November this year although coastal still and how that is about two weeks out so I'm not trying to sell like us\nWho we got to be worried about it now but just keep it in the back of your mind between now and that was just going to have for the most part not much rain ... scattered showers today here and there and just changing the temperature is a little cooler for a couple of days and then a little warmer for a couple of days back and forth so\nThat is something a first time will mentioned again if I'm looking at one model right now which is a pretty good one I've seen in the past one of the American models\nIt shows a raging storm hitting us on the twenty ninth of October as a blazing nor'easter so again I'm just keep it in the back of your mind\nWe shall in that job I'll be I'll be positive for the rest of them and they go that's that's always good right another update coming up well okay\nSo we'll have to see what happens down the line well\nPrince Harry and his wife yes Megan Marco yes are expecting a child in the springtime yes the announcement came there early this morning as Harry and Meghan Margot arrived in Sydney, Australia as strong as they're sixteen day visit to the country\nA pack of Australia Fiji

will be starting to close and\nDoes that have been around for a long long time unfortunately will be starting to close as I said it's kinda sad to see that because\nYou know there are I mean yes there are a lot of churches and cathedrals out there that people can get to down the line but you have a lot of the time you know ... you know say it's either way whether it but it's a\nYou know the age of the parish ah of course a lot of the ah the um the ... the priest and the people in there there's not as many go into the seminary these days and of course you know a lot of the times\nYou you'll get that you know talk about ah you know some of the ah\nSome of the conduct back in the sixties and seventies with some of the priests out there I mean you don't have to you don't have to be you know a professor of a theology to you know\nTo think about that you know it happened here in the Massachusetts area you know some number of years ago when father Porter how you know from St Mary's in a in ... when you know he was a convicted in the Nineteen nineties\nUh so you never know you know it's it is basically you know closing a lot of these parishes that have been around for a long long time so uh\nAs I said there's about a month to go for St Anne's will that stay open probably not a this it's too much money or you know and there's you know especially the people in Fall River I mean this they're very generous with their amounts of money that they have\nYou know and you've got some beautiful people out there in all denominations of languages a you know like in every other community you know you got beautiful churches in our area that you can still go to and unfortunately you know\nThings like that ah you see too many of those churches that are that are closing but anyway\nUh that's

I was a cutting the lawn yesterday and made sure it was all ... up and ready to go and of course uh the uh boy I tell you what a mess a lot of areas are at least\nThe uh the ... the um my area in the front with two major um trees on my land on the front of the house at least we got that cleaned up but\nIt's a it's not over yet and that's for sure\nI'll probably be maybe might still have to do a one more than ... who knows a again as long as we don't get you know keep freezing temperatures are still things ... have a tendency to grow a little bit but\nUh you know at the end with this delayed it with everything uh you know it's probably a good chance some people might be still mowing the lawn sometime in November\nBecause we've had such adequate rain so there's no issues with that so you might have noticed a drop this late this summer season ended early fall not a lot of really dark brown lawns like rain we'd get right or some of them you can tell you you can usually tell them this is a funny joke thing\nWhether the people in the neighborhood that are generally don't care much about their lawn watering or or they don't ... fertilize it then again I'm not a big fertilizer at all but you can always tell the people that don't deal with the lawns too much every summer rom\nOr even some of the ones that don't care about it this summer of ... pretty good compared to what they usually do in September and even our early October but not as we end the season the lawns green up again\nBefore we get across the deep freezer so\nAgain that first threat at frost for the first time the season at this point looks to be potentially friday morning the only thing that might hold it off would be the wind but at that\nPotentially friday morning the only thing that might hold it off would be the wind\nBut at that temperature would still be down to about thirty degrees so again uh nothing too unusual by the way on this data reminder we've talked about this before a hurricane hazel Nineteen fifty for the third hurricane of the season to hit New England ... different areas\nKelly at noon hazel but how about that you think it's bad enough to get a get hit with a hurricane one year one season but get hit three times that a hurricane season of Nineteen fifty for a while so it was a bad one and of course a lot of changes were made after that as we talked about in the past but\nNothing to worry about now again I'll end on this on down the road will be monitoring the Atlantic the abnormally warm Atlantic water's could there be something similar to what we had back in Nineteen Ninety One to get them two weeks out a lot of people say they like to hear not just for myself but others\nSome of these long range thoughts and just put it in the back of your mind just like I was thinking months ago that we were going to have one or two close calls with hurricanes like we've had\nStarting to worry about it a little bit before a Halloween this year that they maybe uh some major coastal storms are the very least it could be a big storm that affects the ships out at sea and we'll have to wait on that that would be in about two weeks from now until then let's enjoy\nThat's for sure we shall do that and that's for sure that I'll talk to you again in the morning or a\nGym sounds good All right as we get our file look at history on this a Fifteen day of

N. A. test and yes yes\nUh it was a six page report on the DNA tests was administered by some guy from some group\nOr the guys won a genius genius a Wylie coyote genius award and it proves it proves that Elizabeth Warren has has Native American DNA coursing through her veins can be anywhere from\nOne thirty second of the DNA\nCoursing through her veins is Native American that's if it's six generations ago if it's ten generations ago it's like one one hundred and fifty second per cent of the DNA coursing through your veins is Native American so there it is um the proof is out there we now know we have the proof\nSome woman and Elizabeth Warren's family background was a loose woman a wanton woman low morals\nShocking shocking up with some Native American and we're supposed to let that go wow wow you want us to to to support and vote for someone from a family with such week moral character as that\nWow [noise] so so\nShe's proven proven the shadow of a doubt I think that there is Native American DNA in her system just like just like\nAnyone who comes from Oklahoma you know was called the Indian Territory before it was called Oklahoma anyone from there probably has some Native American DNA coursing through their veins as well uh but so fine and established\nNative American DNA coursing through their advantage as\nUh in our house growing up who does and who doesn't who does have books in our house we had the American heritage series books we had a oh crap what are the other one's called the covered all kinds of historical stuff\nI'm like we had encyclopedias remembrance cyclic ... remember what encyclopedias mattered\nThe Internet before the Internet we didn't you know sneaking into Web we had encyclopedias for crying out loud wow how long do you think we did our term papers you just copy copy word for word out of the encyclopedia and then change if you ... to ... a few butts tea yet\nMaybe switch around the paragraphs bingo bingo term paper done but any who um we also had magazines we at time magazine Newsweek Magazine us World Report for a while a life magazine Sports Illustrated of course um\nFor a while a life magazine Sports Illustrated of course um maybe\nMaybe having books growing up improves educational outcomes even if they don't read them uh 'cause I didn't read a lot of the books through but I flipped through just about every one of them and I read a lot of the captions under the pictures\nYeah [noise]\nThat's how I knew a general Wolfe was killed during the French an Indian War defending Quebec um\nBut anyway this study finds that adults with college degrees\nBut who grew up with fewer books had the same literacy level is folks who left school in ninth grade\nBut had a lot of books at home as a teenager the research shows that the number of books owned at age sixteen had a direct positive relationship with literacy math in IT IT skills later in life yeah 'cause having lots of books shows intellectual curiosity it exposes you\nA\nExposes you to all kinds of different knowledge it gives you more empathy you look at the world or through other people's shoes not just your own um\n\nThey're making a big deal now in schools about um pre pre kindergarten education you know what pre kindergarten education is\nBooks books exposure kids to books especially a young ladies only smart women can save this world men have been in charge since day one and we screwed it up to a fairly well if there is a young\nDaughter or a granddaughter or nice or grand niece in\nYour life by them books books I tell you from my little sister\nChristina was Nancy Drew it really doesn't matter what it is as long as they're reading books gosh that's helpful helps wire circuits in the brain and all kinds of stuff like that\nBooks gosh that's helpful helps wire circuits in the brain and all kinds of stuff like that\nThat when you have to take my word for I don't remember who said it but some of the lot smarter than me explained it was made sense to me I'm not as much sense is ancient aliens and the X. files makes to me but a lot of sense researchers also figured out which countries owned the most books per household\nYou might think Americans were topped the list how could America's possibly topped the list where the dumbest developed country on planet earth\nWow you might think Americans would topped the list but that honor goes to ... yes ... in the Baltic region ... former members of the Soviet Union way back in the day yes a ...\nA ... came in first by owning an average of two hundred and Eighteen books per house two hundred and Eighteen books for a house\nI think we have two hundred and Eighteen books on three shelves in our Dan and there's about Seventy four shelves and are then we have ... books Norway Norway came in second with two hundred and twelve books on average\nA per household how come we get more immigrants from Norway why would they want to come here they've got a better deal there and they're smarter\nThe U.S does not even crack the top ten landing in eleventh place with an average of one hundred and fourteen books per household just under the world average of course of a hundred and Fifteen here's the sad part sadly\nThirty two percent of us households own only sixty five books\nAnd one in five American households own only five books\nFive American households own only five books\nYeah\nI'm sure this who does the noodles of impure magazines stuffed away somewhere in those households but only five books so it may be time to beef up your book collection to boost your kid does brains the only part of this story\nIn all seriousness that had like more information on according to a new study from the Australian get I might get a throw a shrimp all the Bobby\nNational University and the University of\nNevada\nSince when is the Australian National University and the University of Nevada worked together on a study but any who according to them having more books growing up improve educational outcomes even if they don't\nRead them I Wonder how that works can you just hold the book up to your head and by osmosis information seeps in books matter books met her I Love it um\nOccasionally you know when you're out at a restaurant or on a plane or anywhere in public you see kids would they're evil electronics evil electronics you know those are the kids who are going to grow up worshipping worshipping microwave ovens and plastics I Love it when I see kids with books and whenever I Do\nI go over and say something and only once only once have I complimented a

presented the first challenge to President Trump's travel ban order known as a Muslim ban\nAlso presented the first challenge to President Trump's travel ban order known as a Muslim ban\nHis argument resulted in a nationwide injunction welcome back to democracy now so many great to have you with us we've been trying for a while I Know you've been traveling back and forth around the country particularly in California where you were intimately involved when the negotiations on around\nGetting these kids back together with their parents to meet the judges deadline right but in any war or not brought back we still haven't got them all back what are the numbers\nYou know the numbers are shifting because the government's numbers are shifting we believe there is somewhere between a hundred and two hundred kids who still needs to be reunited and that the crazy thing about it is that they're talking about a new family separation policy haven't even got\nAll the children back together from the first separation policy\nThese kids are so traumatized little children are going to be potentially permanently traumatized and now they're talking about having new family separation\nThere is going to be such an outcry just likes to was the first time may be bigger we'll be back in court I mean I I cannot believe that they're actually talking about another family\nSo impossible to do it I mean after you have the judge's ruling they have to be reunited isn't is defying the courts\nLaw so what they're going to do is we get a little bit and say this is different whatever they want to call it will be back in court\nAnd what about honesty numbers sank ... six thousand families right afraid\nWe have been concerned for a while that there may have been more families separated and the government was really I don't know whether I Am the numbers are exactly correct or not we'll ... we'll have to see what we're waiting for\nIs the government to respond to all the government's doing a sort of categorically the nine seconds and accurate we need more specifics and we will keep pressing the government on on those specific\nWe need more specifics and we will keep pressing the government on on those specifics and and wait to see we have no reason to distrust amnesty is numbers but we'd like to see the government response specifically to them\nSo you're talking about for example the hundreds several hundred children right now so where are they\nThey're in government facilities in the U.S the biggest book where we've been fighting now for about eight weeks is they deported roughly four hundred parents without their children so those parents are all over the world largely in Central America so we have been trying to track those parents define them to ask them\nWhat do you want to do these are your legal options and I was in Guatemala a few weeks ago talking to some of the parents it's an agonizing decision because the government's saying we will bring the parents back we're going to still try and get the parents back but if they can't come back\nThey're having to make this brutal decision do I leave my child in the U.S to pursue asylum and keep them safe or do I bring them back and reunite them and about two thirds of the parents are leaving their children in the u._s. which goes to show you just how dangerous it is there and conservatives are saying well look\nThese parents don't even care about their children are abandoning\nNothing could be further from the truth when I looked in these parents eyes they're such agony making this decision but they said to me I Can't bring my child back here it's just too dangerous I'm old my life's over farm killed 'em killed but I Can't bring my job back here\nI Want to go to a top health and Human Services official told lawmakers that the Senate Judiciary committee hearing that he repeatedly warned the Trump Administration against separating immigrant families important this is Jonathan white commander\nOf the public health service connection core a branch of ha chess white or ... or ... are are which stands for the office of refugee resettlement\nDuring the litter deliberative process over the previous here we raised in them\nDuring the litter deliberative process over the previous here we raised a number of concerns or in the ... program about uh\nAny policy which would result in family separation at ... due to a concerns we had about the best interest of the child as well as about whether that will be operation Lisa portable with the bed capacity we had\nDuring the hearing Connecticut democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also question China than white about the psychological impact of separating children from their parents'\nSeparation of children from their parents entails significant risk of harm to children\nWell it's traumatic for any child separated from his or her parents am I correct I say that as a parent of four children\nThere's no question there's no question that separation of children from parents until significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child\nJust spy Jonathan whites testimony a top official ... immigration and Customs Enforcement agency try to defend the Trump administration's practices separating kids from their parents comparing the child detention facilities to summer camp and this is Matthew all bats had been forced men and removal operations for ice\nI think the best way to describe them is to be more like a summer camp these individuals have access to twenty four seven food and water\nThey have educational opportunities they have recreational opportunities bill structured as well as an structured there's basketball courts there's exercise classes or soccer fields that we put in there\nA veritable summer camp right I\nThink when we see the administration's own kids going to summer camps will know that there really is I work as what I'm so glad you played that clip of commander was talking about the trauma because in some ways it's just starting the or the next phase is just starting these kids are so bad and the government's doing nothing to ...\nPhases just starting these kids are so badly and the government's doing nothing to provide trauma really if we're going to try to get doctors to see all these children pro bono\nBut the children I mean when I talked to a mother of foreign ten year old separated the four year old just keeps asking another reunited are they going to come and take me away again I mean that's the vulnerability that's set in for all these children\nThe government's trying to stop the and to expand the twenty Jay Leno and parents and friends that are in prison right\nSo what they're they're basically saying oh you have a choice you can keep your child with new essentially immigration jail\nOr you can lose your child let your child go out I mean that's no choice at All right and so\nThe government knows very well they have another choice which is to release the family under supervision even if they want to take the harsh step of putting an ankle bracelets on the Trump Administration of ... and then the ... the Obama administration's\nUse of a program that was Ninety seven percent effective in assuring appearance and now they're saying the only choice we have is to keep them in immigration jail or to separate that's absolutely wrong they can release these asylum seeking families under supervision\nLike do they say you are in Guatemala what are these kids and families facing why apparently make the excruciating decision to remain separated from their child on because they fear for their child did I\nI mean absolutely so take this one father we went to see we said we want to come see you will see anytime during the day that I Can't get off work we said farm come at night he said no the gangs closed down the tower and have a curfew I'm not a lot out of my house\nYou certainly can come here I mean that's the kind of danger these families are and what what parent would willingly give up their child they're making the kind of decision that know parents should ever have to face\nYou were in San Diego a lot of negotiating with the documented in court write an ending\nWe're in San Diego a lot of negotiating with the ... minute in court right and and in court right trying to meet this make the government meet this deadline to release than children the first set under five and then the others are going up and to their teen years\nUm what was in the government giving you and what have they even admitted now they didn't when it came to giving information that would connect the parents when they came to information in\nThey had but said you will look for yourself\nExactly so it was like pulling teeth every single step to the first step was\nLook we are and how they actually set in court we don't have a budget item to bring the kids back to their parents they had a budget item of course to separate them\nThe judge said absolutely not his parents are not panic at their own children rather than when we say we can't find these parents without information they said no you go find them the judge said absolutely not it turns out that they get phone numbers for the parents were driving around Central America looking for the parents\nThey were sitting on the phone numbers finally we have the phone numbers we're calling the parents all but tens of the parents are at least out of the last report have been reached but only because we of how to do this legwork\nWhat has to happen now they\nWell I think all the children up the comeback we'd like to see the children get relief we'd like to see the children get a fair asylum proceedings and we certainly don't want to see\nMore separations and we don't want to see a substitute for family separations be long term indefinite detention these families the medical community has said if you detain these families that will cause severe harm to the children long term essentially we don't put four year olds in long term detention in this country\nI saw as I got Trump interview and she said the family separation with the low point of the presidency at she's not just the president's daughter but she is a senior advisor to president and now the president's once again\nHer but she is a senior advisor to president and now the president once again even with hundreds of children still separate in front of the parents saying that they're going to separate them again\nIt's remarkable I mean anybody who was opposed to it hopefully spoke out at the time I mean people need to speak out in real time and stop it\nNot after the fact I cannot believe that the administration is thinking about going back to this this is the only place the musicians ever pulled back and that's because of the public outcry\nNobody has been held accountable for his killing a and no one has has gone to jail in El Salvador or even been put on trial there so there is the second is as important as the ... was there is now the second piece that has to be achieved after all these years\nWe're going to do ...

invited you when we got no you and while it was what a great person [laughter] for the city council I thought um\nAnd you are now nine months in tune you out with and so I still very much for like a political newcomer so I appreciate this opportunity to go on here and I introduced myself a little bit\nYeah well I one of the things that we that I wanted to do for a long time to talk about leadership leadership in general not you know specifics 'cause this there is something that we can learn there that will make us better leaders whether it's in our families\nOr in our community or you know\nAt our church or whatever um that are followers to 'em so you know there's some skills this knowledge that goes with it and I thought you were just three deployments to Iraq and only two ...\nWe just three deployments to Iraq and only to one of the Iraq went to Afghanistan one term Iraq and Afghanistan and how old are your kids then\nUm they weren't around when I was in Iraq in um but then my oldest was four when I was over in Afghanistan and uh it is interesting so I I left him at home with mom for ... for about a year and when she potty trained them and\n[laughter] it was a little piece of is yeah his childhood and plot you felt that you had to do to go and serve the country\nIt was really a choice necessarily um I I definitely felt obligated to re enlist time and again it and\nLook at my military service and my decision to join the Army National guard as one of the the best decisions I've made my life mhm wow it's it's taught me a lot and it's in the Army National guard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer it's sort of thing\nIn Philly you wait for Eighteen months to go to Iraq or a year to go to Afghanistan and all of that but normally it's it's a part time thing um and it's really fascinating to sort of be working at a civilian job as a as a as a software guy and then balance a way to go\nBe an intelligence analyst and have meetings with all sorts of interesting people\nDirections you [laughter] enormous lay their two completely different worlds\nYeah um but it's also I I'm very proud of of that service that I've done it yet and I I I met my wife in the army and like the joke that you learned how to drive in Iraq\n[laughter] was she in the army she if she wasn't she she was over in Iraq with us you know should understand no absolutely very much so\nShe was over in Iraq with us you know should understand you know as much on a\n... you you have um a wonderful Facebook page and and I seen taking your oldest son\nTo climb mount Washington ... ... you know so I Would say that's that's an example the\nFamily leadership okay you know you and your wife lead your family you're near a natural leaders in that role one parent um all kinds of leadership though I'm Talking about a far Italian leadership and authoritative leadership\nIf you ever thought about that I I don't know the difference but I Know um\nIf somebody tells you to do something of forces in in ... years ago for all day and you're supposed to obey you're not going to do that to your full potential in it and whatnot as opposed to was in ...\nI ... you know like as parents if we've been around children we know a lot of our children we love children then we're you know we read up on how to be a good parent and and we just bring all those skills to the floor for that task was a\nPort in anything you do as much as possible has meaning and you have you ever ... and all those yeah absolutely yeah\nYeah but mine fully to do that that absolutely um if you're a day and then it's kind of mindless it can be\nSo in the only reason I hesitate is sometimes I'll push my kids to do something and say we're going to go do this and it's not until aware that the top of mount Washington that they're like oh this was the coolest things I've ever done yeah\nWell I think that's that's that's our bar attained his leadership is like I Know these kids\nThat's our Barra taint his leadership is like I Know these kids will come alive out there in the woods\nIn I don't necessarily agree with that style of leadership but sometimes you have to I Choose to use that to to get my kids out on the adventures of any sort of I I think those those life experiences are incredibly important\nI disagree with it I made the amendment I argued my point that gets it and ultimately I lost it everything has been restricted to industrial zones\nNow for now are for this which is a brand new in the city and in the state and so\nWhy not give it a try an experiment and then later on it can be change when people like more familiarity with it I mean I I'm a raging liberal so [laughter] but I mean I can see the benefits as a compromise\nIt I did too and I was very proud of it because after that change it it I May of ... I didn't get what I wanted\nBut ultimately the overall ordinance changed passed unanimously and I was very happy that we sort of supporting came together for that matter um in that\nAnd you live in a little bit of indirect effect on other is that you were in\nAnd you are doing a little bit or indirect effect of other is that you weren't going to\nPush and be of noxious that you were going to continue to respect them even though you\nDisagreed and I could have tried to play games and ...\nIf an amendment was made and it was a perfect I could've been tack that aspect of it as opposed to discussing the ideas are based on the merits of the ideas somehow I thought that was important there was one of\nIt is the the one moment that I'm most proud of and so far not not necessarily passing the the ordinance itself but the way or another that work together ...\nSo what are the qualities that a person needs when they have to change their their mind or cooperate or collaborate in order to get a good decision way I've no idea [laughter] I think one of the I mean I I come from a ministerial background so\nI'm thinking you have to have a certain humility I agree\nI very much agree I I think you know we can come in and say I know all the answers and I'm right and you're walking in and you know that leads to what we have in Washington [laughter] now and and um you know the authoritarian mentality down there\nThat everybody that disagrees should just roll over and play dead is is poison I mean I think that's why city councils are great because we have to live with each other you know you\nHave to go there I'm going to see\nEach other and and buy you a compromising or being flexible the next time there's something they want you know they may be more give and take\nOr at least the merits of the ideas right we'll hope with two guys are a nation\nGiven to different viewpoints than they were all and I don't mean this in terms of personality is on the city council\nTwo points than they were on and I don't mean this in terms of personality is on the city council I mean general and how we get along\nI in that comes with the middle humility to like you said yeah yeah it's it's incredibly important yeah um I could use more of it but [laughter]\nIf you ask my wife [laughter]\n[noise] um but ... it's\nNot sure she has ways of telling you that certainly that's coming out in our spouses that me and my spouse\nOr my husband is is is at my desk and go hide in just about everything I Do you mean 'cause I Know he he sells fair and he's so kind and he knows how to put things in the general is way\nAnd I don't get my feelings hurt and they don't come I backed out um but I Do come to that place of humility because of the respect that we share for one another\nIt's common set of values [laughter] it is\nYou talked about the the army values of loyalty duty respect\nLoyalty Judy respect\nThe fourth one is self uh self with service which is selfless\nService so which isn't giving over of yourself to a greater benefits and then we'll come to us he will benefit others and we may not get any benefit from\nIt looking at the overall benefit as opposed to any personal gain is um\nWhat's the best thing for Alabama or as a community that you know the question that a lot of leaders would ask themselves\nAnd there was at one point or a friend of mine has suggested oh why don't you go to this event or or do this and it'll be great come reelection time to to show us ...\nThe multitude of people within the community that I wouldn't have met normally I mean I wouldn't have knocked on your door but it was it was a ... it's it's great and it's\nIt's personally very touching to me to to be that that much more involved in community just set the example for like kids but uh it's super excited my my son Jake ended up running for ...\n... it's just your Facebook page [laughter] really [laughter]\nAnd he won in and it was I was so proud of both for just having the the nerve to\nTo help out that they can be bold and he might as well learn that now\nI I loved it it was so proud of them not not necessarily not for winning but for having put himself out there and it was great mhm that to me about failure it never happens to me\n[laughter] I'll meaning of the mines was that sky rocket brewery to discuss the themes in elemental Ron Carlson novel five guys\nThis weekend ablaze yes catch five guys five guys a presentation sponsored by outer boroughs big read the ties into the story with the help from a cast of characters from the community you can watch this program and all of our quality programs from around the area in high definition on double A.

ask I'm Kerry Baluch community relations coordinator at for the hospital and out of our Massachusetts and with me is\nDirt ... hand and I am a sufferer of mental illness and I'm trying to be here to try to break some stigmas that go along with it to carry um what are we trying to where we tried to do with this podcast year\nDerek I really feel that this podcast is meant to make individuals aware of mental health and mental illness in our communities to break stigma to educate 'em as somebody who has a background\nThe very diverse background a mental health um I can say that education outreach and community outreach are so important to the care and the continuity of care for individuals who are suffering from mental illness so I think we just really wanted to get the word out there\nSo I'm for people who don't know us while we do a little bit of a background ourselves but you know nothing to link thing so um what brought you into this field carry\nSo I actually started off on with a desire to be an art therapist\nBecause I had a passion for our and I had a passion for psychology um when I went to college items to my major to art in psychology and just figured you know what I'll see where life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my first job working\nAnd and I had the absolute blessing of having my first job working for a a clubhouse model and hope deal math\nAnd I worked with the chronically mentally ill population but even beyond that there is there's a deeper passion that I have for the population besides the experiences that I've had\nWorking with these individuals my father my father is he diagnosed or individual with bipolar disorder and I seen him struggle throughout my entire life\nAnd I've always had this soft spot in my heart\nFor in a perspective of mental illness is not just your label mental illness is just an aspect of you so from the outside world someone may see for instance my father and say that so and so that's where he has bipolar disorder\nBut I always knew him as dad that's my dad and he just happens that bipolar disorder\nThat I strongly feel influenced my passion for understanding I got the human mind focusing on psychology and then leading into I'm\nLeading to working with individuals with chronic mental health disorders\nAs I said in this field in Massachusetts for about five years\nAnd then decided to make a life leap I moved down to Pennsylvania and I had the opportunity to work with a very different population and I've worked with individuals with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors as well as kind of mental health disorders\nIt gave me a very different aspect of Human Services and healthcare\nUm I was a a case manager for\nThe majority of my time at the campus facility that I had the opportunity to make a leap and moving more towards be missed\nTo make a leap and moving more towards the\nAdmissions outrage community outreach marketing piece of the field which is quite a different step right to go from case management to marketing how does that work I offered him very unique and different aspect\nTo the role I had the opportunity if he truly both sides of or all sides of health care one of my things is often that facility organizations or in the business of providing care\nYou want to provide the best quality care for the individuals that you're serving but it's also a business and there is also needs to have to be addressed on on that end as well ah so fast forward um I stayed with its facilities called would services down and they were in Pennsylvania\nI left there after about nine years to move back home and now I'm here at full or hospital which\nBrings me to a follow up question with all that experience under your belt what is your ah what is your role here at our borough for all spittle\nSo my official title is community relations coordinator um I where many hats I work as a liaison with a referral sources doctors' offices hospitals in Massachusetts Rhode Island\nI work on um marketing and he sort of marketing needs I also focused on I'm planning on events and community outreach events such as to pay for health and wellness fair um and I also work with our service excellence committee and teen here\nToo I'm sure that our standard of care that we're providing individuals' is I'm being met\nAs well as promoting an environment of excellence with in our hospital excellent so did tell me a little more about your history with mental illness\nI Belong history with mental illness um I remember having my ... when I was six years old and\nBut I think the truth is is that we are here to deliver a compassionate care\nBy license clinicians and psychiatrists we're here to do good work and so we spend our days\nGoing to groups and I'm Talking to physicians and doing therapeutic interventions mean that that's I think not a perception of people are sitting around medicated and not receiving services and not getting engaged and that couldn't be further from the truth\nNow is one person or on my own I've been trying to break the stigma of mental illness by becoming very open a talking about a very openly not being embarrassed about it I Know why breaking the stigma of mental and this is so important and why do you think it's so important and why is it so hard to do\nRight you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um and it's\nRight you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um and it's rampant in our community because of the taboo of what people believe I think it goes back to the institutional comments I just made\n'em but the truth is the vast majority of us us ourselves have a family member or friend who suffers from mental illness or substance abuse and so the truth is when we realized that it touches many many people in our lives and across all demographics\nUm socioeconomic genders race\nWhen we start to look at it and the impact that it has then I think people like you are opening people's eyes that that it does it impacts all of us I mean\nI have people who work for me or some of the most amazing employees I have who have mental illness and carry a diagnosis and they're productive and engaged and compassionate and I would say they even bring an added level of care\nUm to our patients because they understand on what it's like to live in those shoes I think the disease impacts a massive amount of the people in our community\nIn this facility works to treat those people in a compassionate patient centered way um and we also serve as a beacon in our community for those who are in need or who seek help to say we're here walk in our front door you know let us assess let us off or resources\nAre carrying I think you had a couple of questions I did [noise]\nRachel how do you think gender plays a role in mental illness I think that's an interesting concept because um and when we look at gender and societies impact on gender um we have all kinds of conceptions about how men and or women should behave and so\nThose social contracts of gender we we actually makeup and so what we believe about gender today is not how people perceive gender fifty one hundred a hundred and fifty years ago or in different countries for that matter the truth isn't impacts both men and women um but in some ways\nThe way it impacts can be different we have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations I'm an act like we\nAnd expectations on how ... we we set those expectations I'm an act like we know how many should be um and when they act less than that we call them weak or other more inappropriate names\nSo it makes it harder for men to seek treatment and so we see 'em for depression and anxiety less men receiving treatment for depression anxiety you see more women receiving treatment and so it's our job at this facility with the help of people like Derek to say\nThis is an impact across the board because people experienced trauma\nUm similarly and so how do we set the stage for a man to be able to walk in and say I need assistance with some of the stuff but also to honor that the vast majority of women have trauma histories and so how do we also creative facility\nAnd a team enter treatment team in physicians who are able to accept\nUm sexual assault survivors into this facility and treat them in a way that allows them to heal I think it's also important we are talking about gender to acknowledge that transgender gender community and so this facility has worked really hard\nTo make sure not only we abide by state statute and abide by hate crimes but that we worked diligently to create a facility that accepts all people period and so whatever that looks like man woman transgender patient who comes in here and can be expected to be treated\nAlong with best practice to not be re traumatized by coming into a facility that doesn't know how to engage all patients with equality and respect and dignity\nCan you give us an example or even a story of of of something that you've seen where you have been able to address this gender roles this gender issue within a mental health facility or setting\nI'm I think I'd go back to um the trans community and I think it has been practice that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single room so we'll have ...\nIs that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single room so we'll have separate and apart bathrooms I think certainly history has told us um that separate is not equal\nAnd so we've worked diligently here to honor someone's known gender and so we have a trans man who comes in um we're putting him with a male roommate access to the male haul 'em as well as access to mail bathrooms and so\nWe frequently will get pushback around that and say what about the other clients\nBut the truth is we navigate this every single day in a vast majority of different circumstances so people who are struggling with race issues and meant and may make racial comments we appropriately placed patients in rooms where they're going to have the most success and sometimes with some of those around\nAnd that's the way it goes but setting the stage for every single person who comes in here to be treated with dignity\nTo honor their identity um honor the work that they need to do and create a healing space for them in fact to do that and we can't do that um if we set the stage from hello that we're not doing the right thing and not honoring who that human is and so I think at full or we're done an exceptional job all the way from intake\nTo honoring people's preferred names um and how does that look and how do we set the stage on the unit for that to be carry through from beginning to end from admission from the very first time you walk into this facility to the day you leave in every single staff is on the same page\nAbout what my expectations are of my staff about how we treat patients but also setting the stage across the board for other patients who are on the unit who may struggle who may not have information who may not have knowledge about that I'm In a way that's appropriate in confidential but again honors that individual patient\nI have I have a follow up to that um how tough has a learning curve been with the the transgender problems that the you know that you face here at the hospital right now\nAnd their problems that the you know that you face here at the hospital right now I'm you know I mean I\nI think the learning curve is ongoing and I think it will be because you know I've done L G T trainings for hospital systems for schools for H R departments for Twenty years\nAnd honestly the training is I did Twenty years ago were super different than the training I Do today because language changes um expectations change statute and legislation changes\nUm and the truth is more often than not it's the adolescent population of the gay lesbian by trans kids who kind of drive and push forward some progress so the language isn't the same as Twenty years ago and so\nThe learning curve is ever present quite honestly\nHowever I Will say that the best practices we put in place here kind of set the stage for expectations so we have a policy on how we engage and treat ... patients\nThat addresses language pronoun use name use 'em while we can't change a healthcare card or a medical record that doesn't mean that we can't honor someone's\nName restroom room designation in a way that meets what their gender is so it's ever changing and were up for the task and I think we do it better than most quite honestly\nI think that it's been practice I'm not best practice but practice for a while for trans patience to be placed in single rooms and have access to single bathrooms\nI think all the legislation around that particular that have come from students and parents\nI'm litigating with schools shows that that's not an acceptable practice and so a\nTrans kid or in fact now a trans patient shouldn't have to go use quote the principles bathroom or the nurses bathroom or be taken off the unit or be put in a single room now might not be an occasion when a transformation it is appropriate there's lots of reasons it's appropriate to put any patient in a single room for a vast majority of reasons\nIt is appropriate there's lots of reasons it's appropriate to put any patient in a single room for a vast majority of reasons\nHowever we should come from the place of we're honoring the gender of which they come in and identify as the name the pronoun then we move forward accordingly and it's quite honestly that simple\nI think the whole bathroom issue has been caught up on\n'em in a comical sex which is very very different from gender and so when we honor that someone's gender is exactly what they tell us that is it's super simple to move forward when when you break it down into its its most simplest terms we honor the gender of what a person identifies us and it's very simple actually to move forward\nAnd will we have bumps of course we will but we have bumps for all kinds of different reasons and we navigate patients around those bumps so yes they board longer 'cause people are waiting for single rooms\nUm they board longer because people will struggle with doing the right thing and I'm I'm not even saying those things necessarily are malicious I think it's a matter of progressive Lee catching up to where we are today and it was more and more people identifying as trans and being more comfortable\nIt it's you know that we don't have more trans people than we've ever had actually trans people have been revered\nIn our country and across the world for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years they were known as our ... which doctors first nation doctors however it's in the last hundred years that we've started persecuting and the level of violence in this community particularly a chance trans woman of color\nUm has gotten completely and utterly out of control so it's very simple when you break it down to its most simple terms do the right thing by an identify gender and everything else falls into place\nSounds like that there is a definite need for education um within our state I think our our country and our communities I Know that for um our health system\nThat was my big thing like I said it was a huge weight lifted off my shoulder and there was no blowed everybody's like proud of you you know and I knew some people knew but I don't think they knew to what degree in how bad it was\nAnd doing that you know people you know the chicken I hey how ya doin' haven't seen it on Facebook and awhile haven't heard from your while I'm having a tough time so like I said you know I just wanted my life back that was the biggest thing so I don't I don't understand why you know I I you know from when you said before you get called names and stuff like that but\nIf you've got friends and you've got a great support system\nThey're not going to hold it against you got and granted I lost some friends\nBut most of my friends when I came out and I told them what I was suffering from they did research on it so they could try to help me right handed or engage conversation right they would go on the Internet and they just wouldn't say oh it's an excuse is it's an excuse he's using his\nHis anxiety depression and his panic as an excuse well no I'm not and if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use as an excuse I use breaking down\nAnd over the past twenty five years you'll know I don't use it as an excuse I use breaking down my cars an excuse to cover up my mental illness don't cover it up anymore I wear like a badge I own it but it doesn't define who you know who I Am anymore\nYou know that was part of the reason so I I live in this community right I used to live six minutes down the road and I would drive by the hospitals consistently and actually only knew of this hospital because I also random ... health\nFacilities in Rhode Island and so when I first got hired here I thought you know that that's my local grocery store next door um this is the main thoroughfare\nMore people need to understand what the White House on the hill is because when we start to understand that fuller is integrated in this community people who live and work here I'm living this community\nAnd so when Kerry came on the first thing I ever said to her as I went to community fair on our front lawn\nAnd lo and behold less than half a year later you know she produce four hundred people in\nFifty um community resource vendors\nAnd so and that's where I'm at you and so that that's important right that's how we do this is come on my front lawn meet my staff\nSay hello carnival games for the kids let me show you who we are and what we're about and what we do here so that we can again we're always working to kind of reduced the stigma that you continue to talk about\nBecause the truth is people work at fuller because we are looking to help people make their lives better and people are here because they're struggling there's not anyone in this facility who isn't currently sick and so\nHow do we get them better and part of it is isn't a community fair is things like the semi colon project so that we started to have some visibility around mental health and so we'll have another community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to come on our front lawn\nWe'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to come on our front lawn to hang out with us um because the truth is that's the only way to start to break it down\nYou know I had to put us I put a banner out front that says walking welcome because I Want people to know that you can walk into our front door you don't have to make a call you don't have to get a PCP referral you don't have to go to an emergency department\nAnd that doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either it means I'm struggling can you help in our answer is always going to be yes what does he need and how do we make it happen and you know my my staff kind of makes fun of me consistently but what am I saying as we come from a place of yes here\nAnd so can we make it happen the answer is yes can I help that patient the answer is yes can I get you to where you need to go next yes can I make you feel better yes\nAnd what we can do it alone we can't do without the patients engagement we can't do it all out with a whole team um but the answer is yes we come from a place of yes how can I help yes come in my front door yes come and ask for help yes we will be there to answer\nWhat would you like people to know about fuller aside and you know you don't want people just think oh that's the house up on the hill with the crazy people go right so your your final thoughts what do you want people to get out of today's a message\nI liked him to see fuller as a resource there are engaged staff there are you know my CFO started here's a housekeeper and never left and he still has his housekeeping shirt on the back of his door\nYou know my director of facilities fuller on the entire neighborhood out behind here and ah his mom was a nurse here and he grew up with full of rent and his mom one of those houses and he's never left here um that is what fuller is\nFull or as a place that has engage staff who are here saying we want to help we're here to help\nBut this community should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to any do you do not have to go to a clinic you do not have to go\nBe a resource you know you do not have to go to any do you do not have to go to a clinic you do not have to go to your PCP and it doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either we have a partial hospitalization program where you can go for the day I have an intensive outpatient program where you can go three times a day or do half days there are many many options to get you help\n'em that don't necessarily end up an inpatient level of care however we have that if that's where you are as well\nAnd so if people could start to see fuller one is a place that's accessible because that's very important to me um but to as a resource um and even if it's just to go straight to outpatient\nHow do we help you set up that therapist appointment that has just been too hard for you to do on the outside because patients if they could have done it they would have already done it right no one's more committed to a patient care than the patient themselves and so frequently I find if they could have made something happened they already have\nAnd so how does fuller offered that next step to actually get them that peace will ever whatever it is we should be accessible um and we should come from places yes\nRachel I just honestly want to say thank you for your ah participation
