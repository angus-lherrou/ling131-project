I'm stepped back from his cohort watching him freezing to him ability as he did so\nSteve was vulnerable again moving one small with all the other men in the stream of time\nWhen asked and re entered the museum yard\nThe treasure had already gone standing where it had been lost his visit to of how long ago she was still poised and graceful about Ashton fooled looking a little tired\nHe approached until that feels much to me when no longer separated by an impossible Gulf of silence\nAhead dissatisfied you said how did you move to stuff so quickly she talked to bracelets around her own wrists\nAnd gave a warm smile we have many other powers besides this\nThen why did you need my help\nLiberate technical reasons it was necessary to remove the objects be required from the presence of the matter in this way we could only needed\nAnd not waste a limited watch like Colin transporting facilities\nNah nah half the price slipped back\nHim slowly handed over the one he was carrying not make no effort to on fast and he's out in\nThat might be a danger in what he was doing was intended to retreat to fess to sign a bit I'm prepared to reduce my fee he said in fact a wave old payment\nMy fee he said in fact a wave old payment in exchange for this he touched his wrist she was watching him with an expression is found them less than the ... come to smile had Matt asked and wanted to go on to join the trust that he had gathered\nI Would not cool that reducing you'll see all the money in the world could not purchased one of those bracelets all the things I have given you\nYou are greedy Mr Ashton you know that we can accelerate the entire world would be yours water that do you have any further interested on planet now you have taken what you need\nThat was a pause when unexpected Lee she smiled\nSo you have guessed I Do not belong to you all wild yes and I know that you have other agents besides myself do come from Mars or why don't you tell me\nI'm quite willing to tell you but you may not affect me if I Do\nHave to look at our Web really what did you mean by that no I'm not from moms or any kind of what you have ever heard you would not understand what I Am yes I Will tell you this\nI Am from the future\nThe future that's ridiculous indeed I should be interested to know why\nIs that sort of thing what possible a past history would be full of time travel is besides going into the past could change the president and produce also paradoxes\nThose are good points though not\nAlso paradoxes\nThose are good points though not perhaps as original as you suppose about the enemy refute the possibility of time travel in general most in the very special case which consensus now\nWhat his ... budget asked\nOn very rare occasions and by the release of an enormous amount of energy\nIt is possible to produce a singularity in time during the fraction of a second when that singularity occurs the pasta becomes accessible to the future so only in a restricted way we can send a minds back to you know somebody's\n\nYour main said Ashton that you are borrowing the body I see oh I have paid for it as I Am paying you the owner has agreed to the times we have very conscientious in these matters after much thinking swiftly\nIf the story was true it gave him a death sentence advantage you mean he continued that you have no direct control over matter and must work through human agents\nYes\nEven those bracelets were made yeah on a mental control she was expanding too much too rapidly\nRevealing all her weaknesses a warning signal was fresh and in the back of asked his mind but he had committed himself too deeply to retreat and then it seems to me he said slowly that you cannot force me\nHand this bracelet\nThat his puffy for true that's all I Want to know\nWas smiling at him and there was something in a smile to shield him\nShe was smiling at him now and there was something in that smile the shield him to the marrow\nWhether or not vindictive stashed and she said quite honestly what I Am going to do now appeals to my sense of justice you have asked for that price that you can keep it no I Will tell you just how useful it will be\nFor a moment astronaut wild impulse to hand back they send a right to she must have guessed his films now it's too late I insist that you keep it\nWho can be groomed for high office like e and

literacy center I Will be with us at a nine thirty ish or so\nA polo sick arrow is a in Studio right now ... uninvited once again oh Apollo good morning I'm but first day or a remote correspondent from agent number six\nNot sure if any of you are watching baseball last night but the Boston Red Sox won the American league championship last night the American league championship heading back to the world series for the first time since two thousand Thirteen like that's supposed to be a long time why back when I was your boy\nWe we had to go back to Nineteen Eighteen to think about that Dr the red Sox won a world title but agent\nSix rights has time to give a big F. you can you say FU yeah I'll say wow okay or to the Boston sports radio talking heads who crucified David Price and Jackie Bradley all year long I'm I'm going to gently disagree age and sex\nDave Price was old and ten lifetime in the playoffs all intent as a starter I tell you what did he done and Jackie Bradley junior tremendous defensive outfielder I think his batting average with negative four hundred and Seventy three during the season I'm pretty sure it was negative four hundred and\nSeventy three uh Dave Price came through last night actually look confident I'm\nChallenged ... challenged hitters throwing inside\nI'm actually challenged hitters challenged hitters throwing inside fast balls wow end up in the fifth inning I sent out an email to some friends of my brothers who is this guy pitching for the red Sox tonight I've never seen him before he didn't look like the Dave Price we've been watching all year so I'm\nI'm although although the talking heads a constant criticism of the red Sox bullpen all year that I'll give him a nephew for but yeah I think they were pretty darn accurate regarding Dave Price and Jackie Bradley junior Jacki Bradley junior MVP but any who pay Paul Oh hi how are you good good good\nUm I failed miserably [noise]\nUm I meant to call you on what does day but I think you were at work so you could promote the forum you had regarding ballot question one yep yep um which is ah should or should hospitals\nUm should be a a a mandatory a limit of a number of patients wow [noise]\nYou introduced with the former allowed for crying out loud wow a forum I had\nTo ... so the ballot initiative for the mandatory staffing ah when\nYou're looking at notes that's not fair and honest and these are just names of the people do it all [laughter] All right but it was a summit stories staffing\nFor nurses patient ratio and then uh\nWe had two two organizations in Massachusetts nurse association who are carrying out Coughlin represented a who was a union kind of behind in support of it and then we had um the American or nurses association who David ... for\nA smoke for them who's the vice president a patient services and the chief nursing officer at\nA sturdy Memorial Hospital and they were against the up there are there are opposed to okay\nAnd if it passes nurses will be assigned to a certain number of patients ...\nAnd if it passes nurses will be assigned a certain number of patients ... shoes ... period and it could go above and beyond that yeah this is a weird question because normally with referendum questions\nI kind of know how I'm going to vote oh I don't know the day the question first comes out yeah and the press this one I mean I've read more about this issue than any other referendum question in a long time\nDidn't have to read a thing about the marijuana question on that [laughter] and I'm Still undecided on this and I still undecided 'cause we because um\nYou don't want nurses overburdened with too many patients but I spent a lot of time in hospitals over the last few years with my parents and well heck with myself in France um and I I haven't seen anyone waiting are suffering because no nurses around\nUm but the other thing that that it makes me wonder if this is a\nNone of us are experts in hospital policy currently there are people who make a living I'm\nA running hospitals so we're going to ask a million or at least thousands of voters across the state with no experience in hospital policy to decide probably the most important question in hospital policy shouldn't hospital policy makers be deciding this I don't know\nYeah I mean I I I kinda feel the same way I think it will be the question you really want the government involved in it or just let the hospital run itself because those are the guys that are operating it but there's always kind of and just that's across the board and whenever there's a union pusher union yeah um [noise] excuse me a union pool for something they kinda\nIt's just awesome but yeah I don't know if it and it's weird because I was on social media looking at the feedback from people and that's the biggest thing too is they always say should we be the ones really deciding this you know and it's that basic question but it's on the ballot so well yeah you know tax policy\nThat's the question but it's on the ballot so long yeah\nYou know tax policy things like that even while the while the marijuana referendum things like things like that yeah the voters should decide but this is kind of like\nFive a week two two to twenty so free from anywhere just use a friend's phone\n[laughter] [noise]\nGive me\n\n\n\n\n[noise] welcome back to pontificate I was a little while sorry folks\nWelcome back to watch a beginning with Paul end the ... area here at Thirteen twenty W. A. R. A. and all over the world that W. A. R. A. radio dot com\nWe're getting some really really good remote correspondence regarding a proposition wonder question one a ballot question one coming up which will all decided on November sick\nUm should hospitals\nHave such tapping level for their nurses or she'll be back off ... hospitals run the role of dark buildings for crying out loud aged Seventy writes in regarding the nurse nurses patient question I can tell you from first hand experience that the nursing staff during the overnight hours\nYou from first hand experience that the nursing staff during the overnight hours is a joke\nAnd this law would fix that when I was in the hospital for surgery there was one nurse for the whole floor during overnight hours okay I can certainly understand agent Seventy how that would motivate you\nTo um vote yes and then one more before we get to our first guest of the day hello Amanda Hi how are you getting who just sit there and wait young lady I got one more row of correspondence to read\nA Ned rights that is one of our quality control engineers I'm In charge of um\nNonsense opinions ... we have to quality control engineers who makes sure the show was sometimes occasionally ground it infects a lady from out of borrowing dead from Westboro Ned writes remember if we vote yes the legislature can always fix it\nLook how they fix the marijuana question yeah we voted to legalize that three years ago and we're still waiting for that tax revenue I'm way out if ratios oh there is a way out if ratios end up being too restrictive\nOr not that they not that what\nThey did to the marijuana was correct thank you vacuum net as someone who's never used marijuana he's still still at least he understands how they're ruining it for those of us who do now moving on [noise]\nAmanda blunt is where this hello Amanda undermining and you're the a new arena is it or or chief cooking bottle washer at the literacy centered teeth thinker and she will think [laughter] what what is your exact title ... executive director okay um\nWhere did you go up what are your qualifications to be executive director of the literacy center\nGreat question following up on the great Joan Ritchie for him yes absolutely replacing ... and ...\nJoel Ritchie yes absolutely replacing the very great tune Ritchie um so yeah I grew up in New Jersey\nAnd a big state what part of a right outside of Princeton oh okay mhm ah so we ... we call that central Jersey actually my grandfather lived next door to Albert I'm not really up yes on Mercer street while fun fact\nWalter mass house depiction of ... in the movie I too was that accurate that well I wasn't around for either although filming over the actual live I can probably not the best person to judge that okay she grew up in New Jersey yeah\nI went to Rutgers University and then I went to Washington University in St Louis for my master's in social work excellent yeah so I've travelled around a little bit but I just moved to this area in June\nYour master's in social work so where does your parents screw up how come you didn't go to school to be a successful capitalist and it's still going to help people [laughter]\nYeah I think he can play my grandmother for that she was a social worker as well\nOkay All right so what brought you talked to this area\nUm this position so I was actually living in Hawaii for a couple of years my fiance is a marine biologist so we were living out there and\nA real marine biologist George stand [laughter]\nReal one okay um so he ever taken a golf ball out of the blow hole of oil\nThat I don't know that would be a great question he maybe he'll call in this morning and let us know okay um so we were living in Hawaii for a little while and we decided to move back to the east coast to be closer to family and I started looking for some work up here and found this position which was just absolutely perfect for me and my background and my interests and you know just loving this area and loving literacy center\nWow so you have a wonderful rewarding job and you got away from that awful awful Hawaiian whether well with the volcanoes\nHurricanes right now I don't know how wonderful it is but it was probably isn't better than here especially now I'm ...\nAnd right now I don't know how wonderful it is but it probably is better than here especially now I'm realizing ... more than ever what this cold weather is about to be like\nIf you ever miss Hawaii and it happens to be a Tuesday Afternoon between four and six PM [laughter] junior radio to W. A. L. ray and you can hear Henry Roman with this dry time a business in Korea show oh he's a born in Hawaii lifelong Hawaii resident\nNicest guy in the ... well no Tom rep Tom reference the nicest guy in the world one of the nicest guy in the world it away wicked smart\nOh awesome there is no it's up on a Tuesday Afternoon\nI Would say to order a literacy center what is it why does it matter\nSays literacy center has been here in outer borough for Thirty years actually this coming years our thirtieth anniversary um and we provide adult basic education reading writing math\nOr digital literacy computer classes in ESL classes to the greater out of our community ESL English as a second look exactly okay All right yeah so it it matters quite a bit um ... as a community that it's about ten percent\nUm immigrants lots of non native English speakers um we're the only ESL provider in the area so um that we have over five hundred students a year\nWow now why why are you helping immigrants who are president tells us role rapists and murderers coming here to steal our jobs and ruin our American way of life why are you on their side\nI it's a great question I don't know that I agree with the president on that um [laughter] um but I also think that the reality is is there is actually non native English speakers who are us citizens are not native English speakers who live next door to you I'm and lots of people\nWho also have low literacy rates so uh you know that might be an inability to read it might be an I'm not a strengthen writing um so we're helping people at all different education levels mhm\nAnd uh where is the center when is it open\nAll different education levels mhm and ah where is the center when is it open how do people contact the center of his ...\nSure so it's right on main street it's I'm right next to the courthouse um eighty north main street it's in the first um first mayors house are usually how beautiful do then yes\nUm we're so fortunate that building is actually donated to us by the city we pay a dollar a year so we're really really really grateful for that um and we are open a Monday through Thursday eight thirty to eight thirty so all day and night and on Fridays eight thirty to twelve and I we have some Saturday classes as well\nOkay that is a beautiful beautiful old building with a wide wide staircases\nYeah it is a really studying building if anybody ever wants to come and just take a tour for architectural purposes it's absolutely beautiful and it's almost in its original um condition mhm very little been changed inside\nActually we are talking to a man to blunt not blow Amanda blood she's the executive director of the literacy such or how long have you been in the job\nJust since June so very very new and in fact I wrote a letter to our staff last night thanking them for their continued patient says I Try to\nFigure out where everything in the building is I feel like I never know the answer you know I'm Still in that that plays I'm always asking someone else for the answer but where does Joe where did you all ... and vote yes where are the ... really and support Jones she's getting weekly phone calls from me so she's not really retired at\nAll what has gone way we could well since you took over in June and what has surprised you like ooh wow didn't know this would be part of the job\nYeah it's actually really a great question um I came into the job at the beginning of our fiscal year so\nIn non profit speak you never really know what that means as far as what grants are going to get and what funding is there um we have a partnership with Bristol County Community college to provide ESL because they don't have an ESL program in this area um and so I ...\nWow do you need anyone to do\n\nFor the ghost story reading yeah it certainly you need to come and do that will come on now you've made a promise you have to keep Oregon recording or [laughter] a lot I don't know what happened last\nYear we didn't get involved in your Halloween swallow rate last year there must have been a reason but I'm old and don't remember\nWhat last year we also had a we had a clue sort of like a mystery man show okay there's a little bit different this year it's more of a a Halloween party\nOkay 'cause two years ago two years ago or our listeners donated ... noodles and ... of bags of candy or to the event of an because Joe Richard they were planning on handing out to the two or three pieces of candy to each student\nAnd the real nonprofit budget that sounds like a real nonprofit joke well yeah but you know as the great gene burns my favorite all time talk show host who I have nothing in common with used to say everything in moderation including moderation [laughter] two or three ... two or three pieces of candy on ...\nIn moderation including moderation [laughter] two or three ... two or three pieces of candy on Halloween so we made it our mission to have every single kid leave that building in a diabetic coma [laughter]\nWith seven eight nine ten pieces of candy well I Will say that would be wonderful if anyone wants to donate packaged candy to our story we will be very very painful\nSo we are officially [noise]\nWhat's a lot of rings for good news when I make a mistake it's one room um\nBut to see what we're going to open it up then again folks or any of you if

thank you that's so wonderful young so much and I'll take credit for all of it and I won't mention your names to anyone [laughter]\nOh so we can um well I I Know we agree on a lot of stuff we disagree and a lot of political stuff but we could all agree on this I think yeah absolutely who doesn't like candy exactly and and we can come together and get those rotten little chrome crushers some candy\nOr for the Halloween swallow right at the literacy center is there any charge for that\nUh so yeah it's it's ten dollars for adults unless you're a student at the center and uh all kids twelve and under our free\nExcellent yep no if you were like fourteen or Fifteen year old kid like me who was the shortest born his class and looks twelve years old can I could I sneak in are you checking id\n[laughter] we would now check your id because it has to my attention but I Know what they were going on the honor system okay excellent but if you're if you're an eight year old wearing a an adult person costume you still are free\nExcellent [laughter] All right I as I said yesterday um this Halloween I'm dressing as a mature adult oh nobody will recognize the great cost to a well you know you

politicians are the number of moderates has not changed\nNot at all not at all but\nTheir influence has disappeared\nDisappeared [noise] um and this uh call him by David Brooks David Brooks of the New York times the rich white civil war talked about this study from a group called more in common\nAnd it basically separated people into seven different political groups seven different are hidden tribes they recalled everything for traditional liberals moderates politically disengaged\nExtreme left wing extreme right wing the whole bit and um the group's eight percent of the um\nOf a\n... all of the seven different groups eight percent of the people are belong to progressive activists on the left\nEight percent of the people are belong to progressive activists on the left that's eight percent of the people and uh they donate millions and millions of dollars to their causes\nSix percent of the people are on our devoted conservatives on the right and they donate millions and millions and millions of dollars to their causes so you have seven different\nGroups of people but only two of them the rich white liberals and the rich white conservatives basically donating all of the money\nUh all uh they they engage in almost all of the lobbying efforts so fourteen percent of the people\nA percent of them rich white guys in the extreme left six percent of the rich white guys

Headquarters out of Washington to the D.C suburbs\nMany speculate the move was designed to benefit Trump's namesake hotel which is located in one block away from the FBI's current headquarters the Trump International hotel has been the subject of a high profile lawsuit charging Trump profits from the hotel\nAnd that foreign dignitaries may choose to stay there to curry favor with the president a possible violation\nOf the monuments clause in the constitution\nIf the FBI were to move out of Washington DC that property could be developed as another hotel just about a block away from Trump's hotel\nWe welcome you to democracy now thank you so much for joining us on professor or shade\nThat without actually the finger pointing to the involvement of the Saudi regime and possibly that tall person in the Saudi regime and that's his crown prince Mohammed bin Salman men\nSuch a horrific crime if it has been if it has happened inside the embassy or consulate no but they could just take the initiative and execute someone without orders from above\nI think many in this country and around the world are shocked that President Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo continue to say we simply oh wait the Saudi investigation\nThis is a Saudi investigation of themselves when the FBI was asked Saturday investigating they said no there were no orders to investigate so the U.S government is waiting for those accused to come up with their own investigation\nAnd when ... when I'm secretary state pump pale on the tarmac in Riyadh after visiting with the crown prince and\nAnd his father the king um and when the video showing them laughing and smiling together was asked what he learned he said it wasn't a factual discussion\nWell\nIt is bizarre ah it has never happened as far as I Know that the accused are involved in the investigation but this is how\nAre they in equality in this world works it is and inequality between countries that are wealthy that are capable of transferring to hundred million dollars to the U.S on the day off the visit of it's a secretary of state\nAnd it isn't that money that actually meat sauce to stagnate\nAnd it isn't that money that actually meat sauce to stagnate in the relationship with the Saudi regime that continues to attack\nA basic human rights inside this country but this act if it actually happened or inside the consulate in Istanbul word is a new phase that we are seeing a and and Saudi Arabia\nBut it's the Saudi regime is allowed to find\nA scapegoat or a cover story that with a low with from any responsibility for the murder of Jim I ... I Would attribute that\nTo the purchasing power of the Saudi regime rather than its integrity and\nThe integrity of its patrons that you United States of America\nTo talk about that relationship talk about President Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner's a\nRelationship clearly what it's called the romance between um a Jared Kushner and the crown prince some of talked about the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and the clown prince Jared Kushner\nBut why they are so close although it shouldn't be confused with the U.S not supporting Saudi Arabia for ah you had President Obama visiting Saudi Arabia I Believe something like four times President Trump's first foreign visit was to Saudi Arabia where he did the famous or\nA a a vent and I did the shore dance et cetera\n\nWell this is the history of this relationship goes back to the ... after the second World War and the discovery of oil and Saudi Arabia the United states did not have any interest in ... at that time\nYour abs they United States did not have any interest in ... at the time as it was called\nOn to a oil was discovered by a an American company\nAnd it is the oil company that brought the U.S government into Saudi Arabia rather than the other way round\nSo we have the oil we have the money that needed to be protected after the uh uh they signing off a contract for a further exploration off the possibility of on a on the floor of a rape yeah\nSo the ... the United states government was brought in to protect the interests of the corporation the oil company that discovered the oil and started pumping it\nAnd the United states found in Saudi Arabia a strategic ally it's had initially administering base in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia where oil was found\nAnd the ministry base was used by the United states as an ... at a at a place to stop on the way to the far east during the Nineteen forties in the Nineteen fifties\nSo the the boy was extremely important and at that time a child you or it was important for the United states and the rest of the world because at at the moment we find that the U.S is less dependent on sovereignty or\nAnd the justification for this close partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United states from the U.S perspective had always been that we need Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is a force of stability in the middle east\nAnd they use Saudi Arabia in the Cold War to launch the jihad in Afghanistan with the U.S approvals and support and Saudi Arabia was actually conveying that and\nSupport and Saudi Arabia was actually conveying that and uh actively participating in that ah you had in the Nineteen eighties\nBut also that as they start to eat in addition to the economic importance of Saudi Arabia the strategic location of Saudi Arabia the importance of Saudi Arabia to the rest of the Muslim world and the Cold War\nOr Saudi Arabia and specifically it's religious tradition that is known to everybody as the ... tradition was a very convenient ... ideology to counter for example\nAnd to imperialist to a a a ideology is in the Nineteen sixties or\nArab nationalism and also socialism so as Islamic fundamentalism was promoted by Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the United states as a counter strategies to all those threatening forces in the world at the time from the perspective of both the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nHowever at when we come to the present and we come to the election of Mr Donald Trump Saudi Arabia had at as you said of course it did to receive that President Obama\nA in Saudi Arabia and frankly if President Obama sold more weapons to Saudi Arabia than any other president but that was one issue that they did not agree on and that is the Iran nuclear agreement which\nAllowed Iran to be happy birthday to enter the international community\nAnd accept are they the conditions off\nThe as they are they're agreement to stop a its nuclear program and Saudi Arabia I felt threatened by that because it felt that President Obama went behind it and behind closed doors and did not involve them in the ...\nAnd I went behind it and behind closed doors and did not involve them in the in the agreement or the negotiation in fact Saudi Arabia at the time wanted the United states to bomb Iran together with Israel\nAnd I wanted to keep the momentum off their rivalry and the and the up a antagonism between the U.S and Iran to make sure that it had the it isn't the only\nA regional power that the U.S could rely on and its relation with the rest of the Arab world\nAt but this agreement went ahead and the relationship went into some kind of um attention at the time until the election of Mr Trump who wants to turn the page and reverse all these agreements and\nBut he continued to be very very close to the Saudi regime\nAs a writer but also as a defender off a policy is that's where it introduced over the years so to get me outta example he had probably his best days where during the day ruled often got dumped\nSo he he was promoting not democracy because if\nSo he he was promoting not democracy because if he did that at the time he would have ended up in prison\nAnd but he was almost like the praising King Abdullah and praising his so called reforms I mean the the the word reformed comes up every time we have a new king but we we we don't go far in that reform\nSo at all so that was a ... he was close to ... who is probably a known to western or just says as the ... the businessmen who uh\nOwns a media empire that he started in in Saudi Arabia\nAnd uh he wanted ... to be the director of a new news channel based in Bahrain called allied up and how she was she was meant to go there and interviewed rate this I'm a news channel\nBut it is very very interesting that that news channel last uh two hours and it was shut down by on orders from the Saudi regime\nAnd therefore should return to Saudi Arabia I continue to rise at until\nKing settlement unemployment been set in mind came to power and that's when he and began to and have a difficult relationship\nAt all so let's not forget that one of his main jobs at was as an advisor and spokesperson to prince Turki al ...\nWho was the ex director of intelligence in Saudi Arabia nature he became the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington and London\nSo he he was very close to that person\nThen ... at the time when ... came to power he ... he\nTime when ... came to power he ... he\nAlmost like we had no patron anymore because he wasn't close to the new guards that came with ... settlement and therefore he was banned from writing he was suspended and ... on Sunday he appears in Washington\nAnd started writing for the Washington Post so my guess is your mom how should we should not be regarded as\nAn opposition figure as a dissident he is a defector from within the ... of power of the Saudi regime\nAnd he moved to Washington which really wanted the Saudis I think simply because he's close to the patrons who the protectors of the Saudi regime that's not forget that Saudi Arabia dependence for security on the U.S\nAnd and therefore ... he began to write to critically off that time of the settlement and his reforms knocked off and then he appreciates that some of them for example giving women the right to drive introducing cinemas\nAnd theater in Saudi Arabia but he was desperate to have freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia as a journalist and uh he started writing and for a different audience a\nAn English speaking or dance which probably water in the factory regime as ... knows too much perhaps and they did not want this to go further\nSo that was the story of him attending conferences in London and going all sorts of stumbled onto a we saw that video of him\nEntering they sowed they called ... and looking for adults\nAnd entering they sowed the call so that ... and looking for a document that's the story that we got from his fiance who was waiting for him outside the ...\nThat he needed a document to say that his divorce his wife and Saudi Arabia and therefore he wouldn't be able to be married in Turkey\nAnd so this is the story that we had this isn't the machine\nI appeared with Jim how should we see on TV and Andrea Jew or when he was the spokesperson of ... I saw that ... in London we disagreed about so many things but I must say that he was a very polite person who wasn't defending that\nAround here was defending the king the policies of looking at the time in his role as the spokesperson for than buses\nAre interestingly the middle east I is reporting Saudi authorities band show chief from writing a newspapers appearing on TV and attending conferences after his remarks during a presentation he made it a Washington think tank on November tense\nI'm In which he was critical of Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency was right after Trump's election in the last\nMinute that we have viewer peace in the New York times like king Solomon must replace NBS talk about what you think has to happen that\nI mean I think we should leave the investigation of the possible murder of July is to have the right to people who are actually who know what they're doing what what is that they're going to happen in Saudi Arabia and what should happen is that first we need to know who the murders are\nAnd who gave them orders and is it is proven that must have been sending men as responsible that are two things that could save Saudi Arabia at this moment\nMine is responsible that are two things that could save Saudi Arabia at this moment won a king sounded month must sack his sons and find an alternative crown prince\nHe should go into a sink into oblivion because his name associate is associated with the smarter and if that if there is evidence to prove that\nThe second thing I I Believe that's just replacing them ... mind with another ... is not enough\nThat has to be a political change in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the murder just off a new MBBS\nAnd an absolute monarchy we can't just simply wait and hope that the future king would it be better than the previous one\nThat is no mechanism in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the margins of somebody like MBA as all previous kings I mean we focus on M. B. S. as if Saudi Arabia had like enjoyed a certain kind of openness or democracy or\nThat they added a month off of free speech it's never been a free country\nAnd therefore ... says mad if he wants to save Saudi Arabia from future upheaval civil wars et cetera he needs to start thinking and making a pledge that Saudi Arabia will become a constitutional monarchy in which the U.S our ... become a\nSymbolic fingers in order to and now a transition to more democratic system and we haven't even mentioned I Do not support any monarchy whether it's a a a an absolute monarchy or echoes the tuition monarchy like the ones that we have in the Arab world\nAnd even in that constitutional arrangement we still have\nThe kings interferes in everything and we have examples at from Morocco to Jordan to Kuwait\nIn everything and we have examples from Morocco to Jordan to Kuwait to Bahrain\nAnd therefore but as a transitional period as appears to prepare Saudi Arabia for a better future then the king must act now however I have my doubts because kinks out of mind is very old and he may not be aware of the severity of what his son may\nHave done and and therefore to focus the mind off of the the world are on this change is extremely important\nBecause Saudi Arabia is not a country with the resources for its own people it's a country that is relevant to the world economy and if we have a situation in Syria in Saudi Arabia or along the lines off for Syria\nYemen or Iraq than the whole world with feel the shock\nAnd we haven't even talked about Yemen as a crown prince is being accused of orchestrating the I'm a killing of a Jamal ... him um\nPiece by piece you have the children of Yemen being blown to pieces you have a country being destroyed by Saudi Arabia backed by the United states we just have thirty seconds\nYes absolutely I think from the very beginning almost ah two thousand and Fifteen I predicted that the Yemen warn that the Saudis are launching is a war impossible to when you cannot to bomb a very very poor country\nAnd a tell all over ten thousand civilians and stabilize a country it's just not going to happen that the Saudis should have\nStayed outside back to a country and not into\nStayed outside back to a country\nAnd not interfered so much and it's in terms of politics that had been a struggle for power in Yemen but the Saudi intervention\nHas made the worst and had as actually contributed to that or a struggle for power not ending soon so the war in Yemen should stop immediately because it's going nowhere and this has become a a Yemen itself has become a\nRights will be delivered a quarter thing they're going to do for the people live in the future agreed upon solution and there was one obsolete incompatible future with their lives they shouldn't have those rights which is what we're living in the ones that reality does includes within it a perpetual occupation\nWe're going to end it here and then we're going to continue in part to his ... posted online at our Web access that democracy now dot org\nGuy an odd is the executive director of the human rights go at selling testified for only the second time before the U.N Security council speaking in Gainesville, Florida ...

Hi we're back and not tonight where are we talking to allies on the show as I mentioned before um for the past few weeks I've had school aged transgender students finding out how the question three is going to affect them and people on the front line\nAnd today we are\nNo real problem over here sorry\nUm I don't know um [noise] anyway uh\nTill they were going to talk to some people from um the flag and also people from freedom from Massachusetts\nI'm so\nToday we're talking about ... people work for normal human rights for the dignity of all people and want to help others who may not know why they should vote yes\nAnd then um I Want to just\nRead while we have this um technical difficulty over here I'm just going to read to you on the the law that we're talking about for questions right and what it says\nOn the on the ballot or\nSo into doesn't sixteen with provision that was put on to the public accommodation laws that\nUh\nPut prohibited grounds for discrimination and places a public accommodation resort or amusement such grounds are race color\nThis is a public accommodation resort or amusement such grounds are race color that religious creed national origin sex disability an ancestry so the governor added sex um gender identity to the list of grounds that cannot be discriminated against\nAnd so that's what we're kind of talking about now and the opposition now wants to take that off of the uh the ... the law so that\nGender identity is not part of that and can be discriminated against yeah so um we have a Joe and Diane or drive with us today Hi guys thing high so now you're coming I really appreciate it and um we um\nWe're just having a little bit of a technical difficulty but um maybe we can um I get that taken care of us\nJust to have some guys that's all\nI can hear me but I Can't hear you\nOh that's interesting yeah um I Can't hear you either got so I'm probably not even on\nI'm On right okay\nI Know my mother up here now I can hear you [laughter] maybe I just wasn't up enough okay well good and we should be okay right right\nI mean look the feeling bad for that but the problem [laughter]\n\n\nAll right so I'm going to just ask a couple of questions um I mean can you tell us or our listeners what ... is and what your association is with them or people\nAre ... is a self help organization or support education advocacy for um parents family friends and allies with the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender communities um\nIs it the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender communities [noise] um and for members of the algae P. T. Q. communities that um are having difficulties in some way or\nI'm wish to participate and help us advocate for non discrimination basically I'm human rights and\nUm it's a\nCommon issue our\nOrganization we we meet\nOnce a month on the third Wednesday of the month that second congregation will church seven PM and anyone and everyone is welcome and\nUm we\nCome out to things like this to lend her support to the ... community and [noise] um it really doesn't make sense to\nTry and remove human rights from a law that is supposed to allow people to go to hotels or restaurants or even funerals and be discriminated against it it just it makes no sense at all to\nUm take a step backward\nAnd um we hope that our listeners will understand that this is significantly more than just a bathroom bill or a locker room bill it's any place where people serve the public\nThat you're not supposed to be able to discriminate against people just because your perception of who they are doesn't agree with some\nFeeling that you have\nSome feeling that you have\nRight ... thank you for saying that um isn't it more than a bathroom bill because that is what the opposition is trying to get people to be afraid of they're saying that women and children are are\nIn their safety that's against their safety to have this on\nThe um on the law\nBecause it they're going to end supposedly dressed up as women just because they want to or just men are going to do that and then um I saw them in the in the in the bathrooms so that's not what's happening\nAnd it's interesting that in the two years that this law has been on the books there have been no violations that the opposition can point to so the the fear mongering over the whole thing drives you to distraction um\nPolice officers support the continuation of the non discrimination against transgender individuals I'm and I'm Paul Tucker who's a state rep and a former police chief from Salem\nUm\nAfter serving thirty two years in the police department says that there's been a zero uptick in public safety incidents as a result of the Massachusetts law protecting our transgender neighbors in public spaces zero up to\nTheir yet ... so I don't know where they're getting it from there just doing it because they think that people are not going to see those numbers that they're zero uptick in public safety issues so they're just going to tell people this is what's gonna happen just to make them think ahead it is\nYeah this is an example is the good of the one outweighs the could have been many right yeah\nYeah this is examples the good of the one outweighs the good at the many right you know it's like who would want to take their rights away from other people based on a hunch or fear mhm no fun is saying that where there is fear there is no face ...\nYou know right and half the time it's\nThat very right sided Christian to say that you know they're all thinking that right it's\nYou know folks I'm born again Christian right and I'm a centrist I guess I mean I I don't believe in politics really I Believe in God right well you\nKnow hopefully on other people will see it that way in and vote yes on this question I\nHave a full I find it interesting that they call themselves Christians and price never preached have poor exclusion right\nSo but so I Want to know where they got that from yeah Paul Tucker went on to say it's always been illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass someone and if someone commits a crime there'll be charged prosecuted sets how the law works and yet in the two years since\nGender identity has been included\nIn the public accommodation ... know uptick\nRight [laughter] right I mean and that public a combination I it does have a section at the bottom that says it directs state um commission against discrimination to adopt rules and make recommendations to carry out the law and also recommendations of legal action on any person who was searched gender identity so it's All right there\nIt's all you know ready for a\nLegal action but nothing's happened I I think happened so um [noise] kind of um [laughter] ... exactly [laughter]\nJust wish that you know they can see this or more people who are in opposition to hear a show like this\nIs there more people who are in opposition to hear a show like this or could see that a real numbers of you know what it's doing to people or what you know the public safety issues are\nAnd and it's not like Massachusetts is\nAt the forefront are out in left field with this they're Eighteen other states in the United states that have\nNondiscrimination laws for public accommodation so it's amazing it's just you know yes there's still work to be done to get the others in the fifty states to come up and\nAcknowledge that people are people and we shouldn't discriminate against one another but\nAt least Nineteen states have said public accommodation if you're running a hotel if you're you're running a restaurant\nAnyone who wants to come in and be civil and have dinner or rent a room that's their right\nRight and this is Massachusetts this is the state that um started marriage equality it's like the state that started all this equality for for all you know to that in four in the sky hasn't fallen you know and [laughter] we're still we're still here and that's you know ... and\nOh you're not kidding because uh I actually asked a few children are here and there in the last couple of years of what they think and\nTo them this is just normal you know the children are\nYour sponges from one day and open minded um [noise] I Am a woman is faith and there is something in in the Bible says uh be have to have the disposition of a child I think like a child um there is love their your trust\nThere is no judgmental isn't I'm Talking about nature versus nurture but my gosh like\nPeople are taught to hate aren't they\nKnow and and I'm back right yeah it's not when they are any now you know can I don't hate I'm purpose I mean it's not just what they know they don't just do it it's tone taught to them\nAnd if anyone wants to cite the Bible is saying that we're abomination so we're wrong or ... or the triple a thought no it doesn't ...\n... yeah I think again it's it's important to circle back to what's really at stake here right said this is a no campaign like to focus a lot on restrooms him and other private right like that but what\nTruly at stake here is every place without work Homer school and so every place that the public usually generally takes for granted when going about their day and ensuring that those protections in place\nWe take for granted when going about their day and ensuring that those protections are placed in those places is going to be really important that people had to the polls and think about how they'll vote on the ballot question\nReally is and it's um just everywhere people go I don't think is um you should be discriminated against\nThis one more point that I found out over the last week is that a ... people do not know what questions three is ... or the questions in general I Know people do have lives they do carry their day to day um and I've\n... I've seen what question three years too many people in the last week\nGive it away from science for freedom in Massachusetts and who I Am trying to reach out\nRight I actually had to explain it to somebody myself to the other day so\nYeah ballot questions by their nature can be really hard because people are as you mentioned there just busy with their regular lives and maybe I don't tune\nInto the very last moments before they had to go you know vote so that's why we are we're working really hard\nTo raise enough money to uh be able to air TV ads on radio as we can really get our message\nOut there um but also it's really comes down to people just telling their friends\nAnd that's why workers I'm there and catch in a vote yes on question three so that we can spread that message I mean you know it's a valid question this particular about washing is pretty confusing because you have to\nGo to uphold the law where it's a no vote with yoga which is in some ways counter intuitive and so um you know we are again robotic able to vote yes to uphold the law a because it may not be their first and then when they had a ballot box\nA colleague of mine at work set this past week in fact that in his experience that those who bring up ...\nExperience that those who bring up ballot questions just by the sheer probability and statistics of it do have an agenda ... do have a point there might be extremist or not I I was the point of view rather than extremism sorry\nAnd uh you mentioned that you're in an argument with something like that and no matter what you can't like to say you can't argue with the media the beach with experience and bring you down to their level so when you're arguing with someone either they can force a twist your arm to prove that they're right\nOr they could violate their own credibility arguments such a silly point\nIt's just amazing to me that ah sometimes these things tend to happen\nRight well that's what they did now physician [noise] saw that he had put this um provision on the law\nAnd me almost immediately they went out and to get seen insurance now what were they telling them when they were getting signatures you know right there probably telling them this thing about the bathroom and how women and children are now going to be so I'm I'm safe going in there\n[laughter] [noise]\nYeah I think that's a good point I mean I I'm you know the bar to get a repeal valid question on the books and Massachusetts is pretty low uh are the opposition only needed to I gather about thirty thousand signatures took place if I'm a ballot\nAnd so that really is a low bar either you know see how easy it would be to collect that many centuries just because a lot of people probably find out even knowing what they were shy\nAll my good and it's only ... percent of voters that that they have to get I read that part of that crack\nAnd what did they seem to choose from to us and all of a thought I was thinking [noise] did they ... they had they had paid\nCanvassers who which that outside of grocery stores and things like that you know people are busy so they may even be with us but just trying to get through you know getting\nPeople are busy so they may even be with us but just trying to get through you know getting to the store and they assigned the paper to get it on to get all of the other day\nActually

forest exhibit and all the work that we've put into it\nRight now are basically in the final stages\nA little bit of touch a pain systems minor repairs here and there and ah\nLast few materials are coming in or more installing knows and\nWho should be ready open soon for those of you who remember the building before I'm One of the major problems is visibility uh we've moved the visitor railing actually further into the rain forest area so you'd be able to look up and see everything from the trees above you\nOr we've changed some of the smaller exhibits are actually added a few of the building as a whole should have a lot more to offer the public basically will never do any new exhibit here the important things that we have to take into account is the animal's going to be spending majority of his life there so we have to make sure that\nAll the needs are met and that's comfortable\nWe also to make sure the exhibit\nLooks attractive to the public and represents correctly where the animals from\nIt also has to be safe for the animal and the visiting pubs\nLastly it needs to\nBasically just looking ice has\nTo be attractive the eye and people want to come back and and see it again\nOne of the main focus of this and we want to maintain the central is called a free flight exhibit where the animals can interact with the public it's up to the animals whether or not they want to do that\nSo you might get lucky make 'em in one day and maybe birds out here walking around a flying back and forth\nUm that's entirely up to them what it is a more interactive experience for the public when they come through and it's something that a little more enjoyable you don't get to see that much and others the official opening day of the building is October twenty second\nThe ... and others in\nThe official opening day of the building is October twenty second\nBasically the elements are essentially the same them just all been upgraded essentially more\nAppropriate size pond for the size of building waterfalls Ben repaired\nUm sprinkler systems are for the benefit the animal and the plants that's another thing that you have to take into account when this building\nIs we have\nProbably for over a hundred plants in here that we also have to take care of along with the animals um so that helps to add to the whole reinforced feel and we'll rein in here several times during the day both in the large exhibit and the smaller satellite exhibits\nTried to have something new every season especially every spring\nOr doesn't always work out that way but\nUh we are dealing with a facility that has new and old elements to it so the older elements constantly to be\nUp to date so central like this building\nWhich are the opportunities that they had to be repaired any way\nWe read the whole inside\nSo essentially is brand\nCome down October twenty second and enjoy all the work we put into it\nThat's it for today's update you can watch all of her content by

on right off the middle of the draw that's going to be humble at the end of the Rhonda [noise] and it's recovered by Franklin the first run by number four Sean hearty formal recovery by number Thirteen will Davis\nSo I guess you have to give a ten yard gain on that you know for the first down even though it's a recovered fumble big play\nSo Franklin moves to the ... thirty nine yard line first and then the third down conversion again Gordon left hander\nSenior six to one sixty five\nThey fake the jets we wide open heavy Raasch all a great blocked by number Seventy six were Franklin we'll get to that for a second completes the pass on the left lots of the Arab world twenty nine close to a first down the lemon yard game what are blocked by numbers Seventy six Matthew\n... he's the left tackle he took out James weird and Nick Evans with one block like uh who\nMade the cashier number six yep\nAnd then number six by the way fans is Matt derives I guess yup\nYup match Ross was that number eight I'm Sorry\nUp the mental number forty four is Adam Mick moral you started at the outer boroughs twenty nine yard line I think you're right Mike that less catch was read Sean let her know yeah that was not a hundred and sixty pounds right that exactly\nAnd then that run on first intent by number forty four actually that made it first intention was nine yards gained over the past to Leonard\nOkay and then a second and one forty four with all run to the outer boroughs twenty seven for two yard gain and our first and ten from the outer borough twenty seven heavily rushed by Nick Evans\nAnd basically thrown away\nFully rushed by Nick Evans\nAnd basically thrown away by the quarterback Gordon\nIntended receiver was dressed school\nSecond intent coming up from the outer borough

down by ... and ... and he moved from the out of oral forty four to the outer boroughs thirty nine\nThat's again of five and then once again allegedly as a pass yeah it's a pass ... of a maybe a foot yeah\nSo second and five and they've got to change the rules about that they really do it's a it's once again you know coaches a smart that take advantage rules but that's not to go\nReally do it's a it's once again the coaches a smart that take advantage rules that's nonsense\nGordon dial the mental overthrows the receiver now is they try to go to Jack on three straight plays Justin theory and on

... makes the first head he's still on his feet as the rugby rock not to be confused with us from continues and he gets all the way down to the adult ... Thirteen yard line so uh for yard gain [noise]\nAnd that was number twenty four on the carry ... ...\nIt's a five yard gain their problem areas hard runner or they get he got his hands on his shoulders but once again the when the guys running hard and laterally and he cuts you just going to get thrown off the amount of how big you are that's exactly what happened good pursuit by the inside backer saved a touchdown\nSeconds six to the change uh they give to the back again number twenty four\nSo second six to the chains uh they give to the back again number twenty four this time running behind the left guard down and the left tackle Leon ... that was a goody amid the tackled\nIn St Paul Mariano carrying over twenty four\nTell ya if I had a chance to coach his team I've moved ... who's a good linebacker I think you'd be a great defensive tackle as low as powerful very quick good notes to the ball you know\nFive ten two hundred pounds third and three coming up\nOnce again stream in line again from the adult borrow ten yard line\nAnd so that was a three or again there are a number twenty four pulmonary they give to hit but bounces off the tackle attempt by go to yell and then dragged down nice\nPursuit but my mind is for the idea was that was really a gap but let's once again\nThere in the three men lined the right line backers right over the outside shoulder the guard the guard doubled down yet knows 'cause they get these three hundred and fifty pound right good shot through like a can and missed the tackle but he's bounce the running back for yards I'd still give them into the system wouldn't call that I miss\nYeah Mike striking came in and cleaned it up now are attempting a field goal attempt to Franklin's outstanding kicker from thirty two yards right know wide to the rise right on the left to right kick in that case was tempted by Parker shepherd\nIt is no good Adel borough dodged a bullet score Romain seven seven\nWith three twenty four to go and

in much better pursuit you know when you get you spread offices yeah would they spread you out\nIt's the spread offices were they spread you out\nWhen you start looking to try to find the ball it's over you have no chance and that last series there they just attack they really did a nice job well done Adel\nAdel borrow their second or first possession really could have first ... and they have three twenty four to go in the first quarter\nWeeks a defensive and Jason where also I think the strongest on quarterback in the lead you out of this is illegal good quarterbacks to\nAnd last week against Mansfield not only Jason we're start normally see nobody does a defensive end thirty second time out for the game and the the\nIt just drives you crazy with all these mistakes they tried to do so many things now that some coaches thank goodness for that that they have the five time out there because they need 'em\nBut anyway Jason we're defensive and starts as a weak side defensive and um when queen Charles needed a breather\nQuarterback Jason we're moved to defensive tackle you don't see that often let a nickname him Tarzan\nAdel borrow moving right to left first intent on their own ten that's an eight men line Mike\nThat's a fifty to Rob monster\nOut of his office of law yeah and there is a flag down for a legal procedures out of world came out in the Cape ... formation with
