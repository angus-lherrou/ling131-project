our city councilor I taught Kobus Todd thanks for coming in today they\nFollow it was a pleasure to be here I Love you have to give it to be\nAbsolutely so ... this thing that's going to be laid back and I think um they weren't going to be a end up doing this image will try to do like every uh the last Wednesday or so of every month to try to do not like a city update\nKind of what's going on in the city a tide Kobus for some of our listeners who don't know is a newly elected to our city council\nAre so tied for ah for some of our listeners who may or may not know you could you give us a brief background\nI for ah for some of our listeners who may or may not know you could you give us a brief background on you or experience kinda just like it was a little profile on you\nAbsolutely thanks again for having me on this great and would love to come on a on a regular semi regular basis a\nLittle bit of background about myself I grew up here and out of ... my my wife and I grew up in ... we have three young kids I'm One of the day care and then when it suddenly went and bread and\nA group relatively for um it had to join the Army National guard to help pay for college uh went to U. mass Dartmouth I'm In the army it was an intelligence analyst enough of deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan I'm On the civilian side I work as a software engineer and\nIn general business areas which I think are better suited for that that type of business um this was there there was some disagreements on on how to do that I I Know famously the the chief of police came out and spoke against that and and he and I also had a lot\nFamously the the chief of police came out and spoke against that and and he and I also had a long conversation at my kitchen table about this in in his concerns um\nIn the the mayor felt differently and thought that a blind everywhere um or ... in general business\nSo when this finally came to vote and we voted out of committee\nPeople would raise some concerns about where the zoning should be and whatnot and the the ordinance being of Lebanon pages or so of uses it for the draft ordinance was fairly complicated and by splitting things into two separate zoning regents\nIf if it complicated things quite a bit and so I was concerned we bought his out on Tuesday and then on Thursday we were going to vote it in front of the ... a council\nI was concerned that in front of the council somebody would try to amended to put everything back ... to restrict everything to industrial areas and so even though I I very much disagreed with that decision\nI thought it was important that we have the discussion on the council floor so I stayed up fairly late on Wednesday night ... reworking the the ordinance and drafted\nThe amendment and printed out copies for everybody to say here's\nThe the original ordinance in and here's what it would look like if if we restrict everything to industrial and in here all the amendments we need to make 'em\nAnd so I propose that it in front of the council in and said I disagree with this but let's have the conversation let's what if we do restrict everything to industrial and I had all of my arguments against it um ultimately that failed or the amendment passed my my arguments against\nSee that failed or the amendment passed my my arguments against the against the amendment failed um and so we move forward with the adult use marijuana restricted to industrial zones in that passed unanimously and so\nAs much as I was disappointed with the with that aspect of the outcome yeah I was very proud of the way the process worked in that democracy worked in that\nYou showed a little bit of respect for my fellow counselors to say hey I Know this is important to you I disagree with it but I'm not going to try to play games in order to to get this passed so I'm not going to\nLike let you try to stumble and maybe ... ... you don't forget the night ... somewhere in the amendment and that strike the whole thing down as opposed to having a discussion on on the topic itself in in really looking at it on the merits of\nOf the idea and so\nAs much as I was disappointed that I'm I'm incredibly proud of the way the process work yeah I mean that's democracy right\nI think ah the word that I'm going to use and we probably don't use it too much in a in politics was compromise\nThat's basically what happened [laughter] so it's almost like something was better than absolutely nothing\nUh you know in the city and and that's what I was always curious to when I was a you know reading the paper and for those listening that probably or maybe they don't know what we're afraid to is that\nI'm right now it's all zoned industrial ally versus hiring or the industrial versus ... as well as commercial in our city and you know there was an article or I Can't remember what it was but uh\nI think the mayor said he wanted 'em ten as opposed to we have five right now and that was like a big backlash going back and for the newspaper I'm just reading like ...\nIf right now and that was like a big backlash going back and for the newspaper I'm just reading and like when like what's the problem it get a five to ... see how it works and then later on if you know and this is just me thinking and later on then expanded if that calls for it you know\nAnd that was so that there are not any limits on the number of cultivation centers manufacturing centers that we have in the city there are limits on medical marijuana within the city the only thing we restrict it to five was the number of retail locations for adult use marijuana within the city\nIn that limit was based on\nGuidance from the state that we couldn't limit um the total number of retail locations to fewer than twenty percent of the total number of liquor licenses we have and we have we we had Nineteen at the time so the the ... the fewest we could limited to would be for retail locations\nUm but then some guidance from Colorado suggested that in order to effectively replace the illicit market in in your city\nIt's good to have people need access to to marijuana\nIn a rough density number that's that they've found works best is one retail location for Seventy five hundred residents\n... anniversary of roughly forty five thousand that would have been six location so I said let's meet them at all it was an arbitrary number it was based on those those two numbers that I was looking at\nSo I set it up by and said it would start there and at this point it's a number of we can just we can increase if we need to but if we just open up the floodgates it's really hard to put you know to\nThat back in time to be completely honest I Would like to see some of the industrial zoning actually being utilized an outer borough you know he said we have plenty of it and you look at all the buildings that you know I Am done a couple of segments on him before where [noise]\nAll the buildings that you know I Am done a couple of segments on him before where\nOut of our was the the jewelry capital I say that you know people are ... province but no I I truly believe it was out of our other Julie capital and all these factories or an ... an outer borough and now\nThey're just not utilize just because of what's happened you know and you know jobs going overseas or people moving to different states so to be completely honest uh I I like your idea when at separating the retail in the commercials and actually I mean if ... industrial I think that's\nBeneficial to have that and you're actually utilizing the industrial buildings in Arab world that hasn't been used in in so long\nOh absolutely you know so I'm already folks who were in Studio with a ... go ahead and so one of the things that that I'm looking at now that will be coming down the pipeline potentially by next year is the candidates control commission this the state board that that is regulating adult use marijuana\nIs looking to vote on October Eighteenth on whether or not to move forward with\nMarijuana delivery services there were there were two pieces that were initially on the table for for the state which were home delivery and social consumption both of those were pulled back I'm Around April timeframe when when they you know finally finalize their their regulations\nSo in October they're going to be voting on delivery services social consumption is still very much off the table here um\nThat delivery services something I I think we would definitely benefit out of ... and so ... worked on a memo and and the mayor signed off on it and in a\nGym Hawkins a signed off on it that we're going to be sending forward to the C C C encouraging them to move forward with that and the rationale and the reason behind supporting that is everybody has\nThe rationale and the reason behind supporting that is everybody has concerns about people driving in intoxication aspects so this is in theory safer for for the residents\nBut it's also when we talk about replacing the illicit market this increases the availability so it's it's good for the businesses increases their sales also does does well to ... place that illicit market by by increasing availability yeah but one of the other aspects um\nIs that the surrounding communities that have been move forward and passed an ordinance in outer boroughs one of the the first twenty four cities in the state to to have passed anything so we're out of three hundred three hundred and however many cities in the state where we are definitely a head of the the pack\n'em so for all the surrounding communities\nIf if we allow delivery into their communities which the state would require like if if they pass delivery they they would say that these\nCommunities that may have voted no can't forbid delivery into their states all of that tax money from surrounding communities comes back to Adam wrote and so that's\nI I think that's that's great for the city in general\nAbsolutely I think anyone who [noise] who has research or even seen the news with the cities that have legalized is and the benefits have named proceed from the funds basically physically and um but you know to me it's I Would say just legalize it throughout the whole thing to stack the hell out of it [laughter] [laughter]\nBut er but already folks very studio ... or ... or ...\nAnd I were to give them a little city update talking about is for us first year on the city council ... what he's worked on when he continues to work on\nUs or if anyone wants to call and have a question for a tide you can call in at five a way to do to a Thirteen twenty or you can send me an email\nTodd you can call in at five a week to do to a Thirteen twenty or you can send me an email at polo P. A. U. L. O. W. A. R. A. radio dot com if you have a question you can send send me an email and I'll I'll ask them although they take a quick break so stick around we'll be right back after these messages in order to

it's fair yeah and it's also if you look at a map of of Massachusetts in this the cities that have passed\nA map of of Massachusetts in this the cities that have passed similar ordinances within their cities it's all on what's called the urban sprawl sort of line it's as cities built out and build out and have less and less land available\nThey they tend to pass these these ordinances and so you can see it sort of moving west from from Boston and there's there's just a band around Boston this sort of stops around Edinburgh yeah so I think it's it's time for us to pass\nSomething along those lines here talking about common sense legislation [laughter] it makes us to make absolutely no I I completely agree 'cause he was injured because when I when I read too I was running into hunters all the time that we're you know\nA ... ones that are common sense would always say that when I asked I asked him a ... the the people that I'm the proper them onto anyway be before of course you know and then there's just on his like I'm not doing that that just isn't land for everyone blah blah blah\nAnd in don't get me wrong there's challenges with enforcement in it though the ordinance wouldn't be perfect\nBut er it's similar to what other towns of fast and and it's just it just makes sense to me so that's one of the things that that I'm working on um additionally going on in the city there's this whole discussion\nAbout the area moving forward and paying back their money and do they get to can they can they keep the four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to to clean up the the old landfill or not um me personally I think\nI didn't like the air is saying that that they wanted the city to just forgive the money that that\nWas a a tough pill to swallow especially with with the high school and everything going on in taxes going up like ... now it's not the time not that any time is over the time for us to just\nNow's not the time I not that any time of the time for us to just be loose with with our money but yeah especially now it was it was bad timing\nBecause it's so for the area to come back and say we'll give you back all of the money but in order for us to to move forward we need four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to clean up this land filled that we can't get grants for its the city's responsibility as the city's landfill in order for us to continue developing things downtown\nWe like we need this four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to clean up the land and so that was a a logical thing it keeps the air a moving forward it keeps the downtown ... revitalization moving forward um\nThere was there was just a letter to the editor in the paper talking about how parking at the um at the the train station\nFills up by eight o'clock in in the question was what's going on with the the parking structure there\nWell there's a number of things that need to happen before they can build that parking structure and one of them being cleaning up this landfills so that they could sell the land and move forward\nSo I'm so supportive of giving them this this four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to clean up that land so that they can then move forward and it's the city's responsibility anyway of\nGrants for cleaning up landfills are are provided to ... to to the area for to clean up land that the say like a a company had dispose of watches with trading him or whatever in there and\nThen the company went out of business and so there's no way for them to recoup that money the state funds in grants available for that but where the city was the responsible party it's this that there isn't a money it's a similar thing to cleaning up and Bert field yeah absolutely\nA similar thing to cleaning up in bergenfield yeah absolutely\nAlready folks were a city with a city council adversity counselor taco vis we're discussing his first year as a city councilor a kind of the car and proud or something going on\nI talked

as well so Thanks Tom and uh hopefully I Know that he's got a couple of a request ready to go as well so we've got bad standing by for tomorrow morning right now we're going to check in with Jim Corman without next check on the forecast for us once again Jim\nAlthough I'm a ... what else is new is that a lot of these days over the last few months with with this locked in weather patterns\nHowever we're going to see a southwest when today and that's kind of warm things up at least for a little while this afternoon eventually getting to the low seventies will have some sun\nBasically the clouds as the day whereas on again a frequent the type of forecast we've had with clouds in Sinai which usually can't seem to get either completely sunny or completely cloudy on many days now tonight we're going to have just a sprinkler to otherwise a low impact situation back to the mid fifties by morning\nSetting the stage where mostly sunny skies tomorrow against some filtered son at times or with a front against stalling off to the south as we've been talking about\nUh everything is a little further north and it should be this time of the year\nThat's why I normally on this time of year early October I'd be saying bright blue skies refreshing northwest breeze but this time it's northeast with a front style to the south close enough so the bottom line is we're going to have a mostly sunny sky but it may be filtered at times by some clouds then\nAfter we get to the low sixties tomorrow it's back to the mid sixties seasonable sunshine on Saturday and then back to south west wins on Sunday as I said a easy thing to remember it's ...\nSaturday and then back to south west wins on Sunday as I said are easy thing to remember it's going to be probably about the same Sunday as it is today low seventies and then back to the mid sixties on Monday Tuesday of next week\nAt least Seventy if we get enough of a south west low perhaps some mid seventies Tuesday and then up near eighty possible Wednesday and a couple of days next week would actually get into the low eighties\nThat would be almost near record highs for this time of the year at that time of the year next week\nAnd then again that's some wet weather potentially moving in by late next week are determined by the approach of that front they talked about and also a if there's some tropical action in the Gulf whether some of that voice it gets in here if they combine just right we could have a rather wet stretch\nThat quip linger into next weekend not this weekend next weekend\nAgain and we talked about one month ago today setting the clock back or going back to Eighteen sixty nine ... here's the question of the morning for you in terms of what was going on in this state weather wise and Eighteen sixty\nNine and when you if you get it right there will be great but if you do you'll say oh I remember you talking about that like last year\nThis this time of the year Eighteen sixty nine\nI was a bad situation there was a hip\nHow our well why it had to be this time of year we've probably had a one probably had an early snow fall\nA good guess and uh actually will be talking about that as you know [laughter] or early next week when we got it early snow fall no or you're the good guess though it's close Saxby scale the big hurricane Eighteen sixty nine that was just before the weather bureau was formed in fact that was the storm that was predicted by a guy whose last name was ...\nA and a three years later eighty well two years later Eighteen Seventy one Eighteen Seventy two is when they finally established the weather bureau built a based in Washington and they started getting better forecast for hurricanes bad hurricane it's slim Nova Scotia but we've got heavy heavy rains as we were on the left side of it\nIt slammed Nova Scotia but we've got heavy heavy rains as we were on the left side of it as is often the is not a lot of wind here we get some went but floods\nAre like up the union as they say job one a almost a foot of rain in some areas because it was not all that fast and again I noticed through history was not that old at that time but Eighteen sixty nine once again indication that we still can get some action in October but certainly not this time\nHopefully we won't see too much of that uh this year yeah sure\nI'm quick questions about the music ... was that was was that the stylistic\nWas that the stylistic snow no that was the job is just any ... any ah any homo basically did on his own his own stuff he didn't he wasn't with any group at the time no\nOh okay because it sounded like\nSilos sounded like Russell Tompkins the former lead singer on this island six I Know they they both had a similar high false ... voice back then you know\nAnd that's the thing I was gonna ask is that I could hear that the music and that song sounds had that same style what was that that you know the the music they were using in that song sounded a little like with a stylistic so I only know this\nBecause my parents as a kid I remember them playing the stylistic so a lot and that's on as well which uh I always thought was the

that high temperatures briefly getting to about Seventy one Seventy two so you're up to thirty three o'clock this afternoon there'll be a southwest breeze tonight\nJust a few scattered clouds which may produce a sprinkler low impact them mostly clear by the way a late night well we can't forget the mold it's a just a boat last quarter now so you don't see it until late\nFalling back to the mid fifties and then tomorrow\nSunshine's of high cloud perhaps the son of it but no problems low sixties again about ten degrees cooler than today or less warm\nAnd then the who warning for the rest of the week Saturday morning forty five many areas right at sunrise a bit of a sea of red threat there then nice recovery to sixty five with mainly sunny skies Saturday afternoon in low seventies on Sunday\nCoverage of sixty five would mainly sunny skies Saturday afternoon and low seventies on Sunday as again and saying in terms of temperature Sunday and today quite similar\nAnd then a shade cooler on Monday almost like going from today to tomorrow from Sunday Monday back into the mid sixties warming up to the seventies on Tuesday and we have a shot at eighty\nOr even a little higher than that perhaps by Wednesday and Thursday of next week something to monitor and then could get wet here late next week perhaps extending into part of the weekend but let's not worry about it now we have the overall good weather weekend holiday weekend where they're coming up six twenty\nThe sunset today with a low tide at ten o'clock\nAgain a reminder and we'll talk more about it we got one month away from studying the clocks back so we're going to have for the next month before we do ... mornings if especially if it's cloudy\nAnd we do have still have mentioned it all morning but it's out there ... hurricane lives with ... mile an hour winds seems like it's been out there forever\nAnd it will continue to be out there for forever more until it finally dies or maybe it another week it has not bothered land though\nA storm that's been around two weeks without affecting land so that's a good thing\nAs far as that's concerned snowed in parts of Alberta, Canada I bring that up because even there that's a little early uh you know the one in Calgary there the big city or they had several inches or as they've as written centimeters there\nAre many centimeters that's an indication that we have the cold in the west and we're going to keep the overall warmer than average weather pattern here in the east and that's why\nAre we will have temperatures that will not be cool certainly no worries of frost anytime soon as we start to go through October and we have to worry about that\nWhere we meaning in terms of we have tender plants and he's late season vegetables that could be growing but do threats of frost anytime soon so that is the good news and by the way ... talked about fishing especially down in\nUh the uh Jamestown area and stuff like that well we actually also have some good fishing in our ponds\nJamestown area and stuff like that well we actually also have some good fishing and our ponds and lakes the main reason well temperatures but also have cooled off a little bit over the last couple of months but also we have uh just perfect water temperatures and the waters are filled up\nBy the recent rain so ponds lakes anywhere you can fish and I understand it's a good time of year right now for large mouth bass fishing if you like to do that in inland pawns of lakes where it's available and I know they do it\nIn the ... reservoir every time I go by there and one forty there's usually somebody or a bunch of people they're fishing there and so uh that as well as the Waterman reservoir or island and also other parts of lakes around the area with fishing is alive good large mouth bass fishing fishing\nAnd also you get those bait fish that are good as well\nYou know I Know I'm going I Know the macro is usually out right around between September and October as well and that's what we used to show uh we used to fish for all the time we had these bamboo poles that my dad used to have these macro pools and\nUh you know they are still at my my dad's house a by tied up more on the ceiling of the house in the basement\nBut I always remember you know going out there and I was one funny story that I Do what we did one one um [noise] uh Columbus Day weekend\nOr that we were down there and that for getting in Jamestown where uh my mom and my sister were like bring in like I think I think we probably brought home about twenty five fish because they were just coming out bam boom boom I mean\nOnce you know and my mom you know my mom was the one that she said that she'd say oh I've got I've got a fish are not going to do this and I'm a as soon as she loves going out there and so and then when I was reading that\nCould actually ... you'd actually added cook cook it at night or whatever\nOr what we basically did is we we brought it home and we based\nNight or whatever or a well we basically did is we we brought it home and we basically are froze them we actually had a little we've frozen for after a while we did actually have them um the next next night or something I didn't particularly care for the ... I didn't like the the bad thing I Love fish for some reason I didn't like the mackerel\nBut ... to another story but\nAs I said we were going back and forth you know my sister and my mom was going back and forth back and for a while my dad\nUh I was actually grabbing the fish off the pole and putting them in the bucket and giving it to my dad and I was helping him you know clean them and fillet them right there maybe about twenty thirty feet away from him a from where my mom was a he was near the rocks there\nAnd ah and then all of a sudden we had this huge pale of laid back row coming back at home\nAnd uh you know we put them in ice and stuff like that and then by the time we got home you know my mom put them in the freezer down in our seller\nAnd then uh we had we had fish for another month or so for a while so we ... but then at one point uh we also had blue fish of blue fish I've actually had tastes the same blue fish actually with\nA talent and tomato sauce or tallying tomato paste and tomato sauce is actually very very good I've had that my mom used to make that every once in a while on friday for us\nThat would be off Jamestown\nOh yes we used to go to James down almost every in during the summer we were probably there I Would say in the summertime we were probably they're not just\nFor Columbus Day I'm a Labor Day weekend but a lot of times we would go almost every other weekend we would go to Jamestown Narragansett but most of the time we'd stay in Jamestown because that was our that was my favorite place\nAnd you know right now if you were to go down there the exact spot where you used to fish oh sure yeah\nAnd you know right now if you will go down there the exact spot where you used to fish\nOh sure yeah in fact a gallon I we're down in that same exact spot about three weeks ago a cause you don't fit they still people fish out there but it's it's kind of a\nIt's it actually been ... renovated the or the pier down in Fort Getty has been renovated but there's not a heck of a lot of people who had fish down there because it's more of a a\nYou're listening to W.

about sex the oldest profession\n[noise] ...\nUm but yes yes keep robots out of the oldest profession they've taken away factory jobs they're going to take away farming jobs\nUm oh there's another one um they go on it now now\nWe might get some pushback finally against robots that story here robots I'm going to be going to be taking the jobs of human resources for assistance\nImagine that now we'll get some pushback finally yes you want to be interviewed by human being anymore a great interview was all about connecting with your interviewer right eye contact be charming be curious ... sorry folks\nHold on let me hit there's\nNot any more you may have to rethink that as more and more fortune five hundred companies are looking to robots or artificial intelligence to perform initial online interviews for prospective job opportunities [noise]\nWe can have sex with robots good but you will the interview that by them possibly for example they say a company like apple would interview a software engineer candidate and the robot would match that person would it be\nA software engineer candidate and the robot would match that person would they pay attention ... job that would line up with their skills employers say quote it opens up opportunities for candidates who may not fit the typical\nOh here's a little premiere or is it primer on tools this is from Tuesday's daily problems she gives me Monday I yeah Tuesdays daily probably October second uh dueling what it meant\nBy Cynthia Fernandez theater fans might get caught in a bidding war for a chance to see Hamilton currently wow in Boston crowds hopefully they won't have to resort to a tool to score the coveted tickets\nFounding father Alexander Hamilton the subject of the play famously died in such a face off with Aaron Burr in Eighteen oh four and a landmark bio musical references to other tools they used to be pretty popular things to shed light on the deadly custom metro\nMinutes shut out Yale professor Joanne Freeman an expert on dueling and political violence in early America and the author of\nAnd political violence in early America and the author of\nAffairs of Autor national politics in the New Republic ... ... yeah the Aaron Burr Alexander Hamilton dual a ended Hamilton's\nLife and ended Burr's political career [noise] excuse me what\nAre the origins of dueling you may ask yourself in a sense dueling the general idea of trial by fire dates back to ancient Greeks enrollments\nIt was a way of settling group differences by having to individuals fight each other on behalf of their city state nation or Klan\nYou know if I'm if we tried to settle the Cold War with Russia\nBy actually having a real fight between rocky and I've enjoyed go by most break you yeah see they they they used to really do that\nWhich um I always when I was a little kid he used to think of that concept why the whole country's go to war why are we doing it that way why to thousands millions have to die let's just send our best they'll set in their best to\nLet them fight it out for ten rounds and whichever wins that country lands we don't get buildings blowing up wedding parties blown up we don't have thousands or millions die you know like the star trek episode where they fought wars by computer so the infrastructure remained intact\nAny who where it was a guy\nIn early modern Europe dueling as we currently understand it took shape to men facing each other on the field of order and shooting at each other to defend their reputations it came to the new world along with settlers from the old world\nSince it came to the new world along with settlers from the old\nWorld during Hamilton's time how widespread was dueling\nIt was relatively widespread though why wouldn't necessarily call it common and again the I there is um\nYale professor Joanne Freeman\nJoanne were you there when Kavanaugh was there did he ever throw up on your shoes\nI don't know anyway are dueling was relatively widespread though Mr Freeman wouldn't necessarily call it common\nThere weren't tools happening every day but gentlemen and the Eighteenth and early Nineteen century knew that if they said the wrong thing the wrong way to the wrong person they might get entangled in an affair of order\nLaunching negotiations that might lead to a dual interesting hey one of us has gotta die we'll call it an affair of owner\n... ...\nOver the course of his life Alexander Hamilton was involved in nearly ten dual ...\nExcuse me\n[noise] read that wrong\nAlexander Hamilton over the course of his life was involved in ten near near dual negotiations that didn't lead to a fight on the field of honor before his final duel with Aaron Burr\nUm what were the weapons of choice sorts of twenty paces that's what I Would choose anyone challenges me to a dual and I get to pick the weapons swords at twenty paces that'd be much safer for me\nIn the old world there was a good deal of dueling was swords as well as pistols in the ...\nWorld there was a good deal of dueling was swords as well as pistols in the new world pistols were the most common weapon partly because fencing wasn't all that common\nSoutherners tend to prefer traditional dueling pistols excuse me southerners pretended to prefer traditional\n... [laughter] westerners\nSometimes resorted to bully knives and win northerners became entangled in tools with southerners in Congress they sometimes decided to fight with the rifles the kind of weapon they were most familiar with in the north where's the time okay now\nIf you're if I haven't boards you to death and you're still listening this is the most interesting part to me and or something I have talked about\nBefore okay um\nWas there a code of ethics [noise] there were rituals and rules designed to ensure a fair fight or ideally to unable to man to negotiate their way out of a dual without compromising\nTheir honor and this is the part this is a big part and it's funny this is I speculated this and I've said this on the radio before it's nice to get confirmation of this view from a Yale professor\nI'm a Yale professor Joanne Freeman yesterday Yale professor who's not Brett Kavanaugh\n'em up up up a bomb\nAs counter intuitive as it may seem dueling was not about killing let that sink in dueling was not about killing\nThe point of a dual was to prove that you are willing to die for the sake of your honor not to kill your opponent in the vast majority of tools that vast\nNot to kill your opponent in the vast majority of tools the vast majority of tools\nNo one died\nTools were designed to provide many ways to avoid bloodshed if possible as far as gaining the moral high ground was concerned the best way was to ensure\nExcuse me the best way to ensure that was to be the offended party in a dual not the person who gave the offense\nMen were often somewhat strategic and maneuvering insults and responses to same in an effort to avoid being the person tossing off an insult so you wanted to be the insult the not the insult tour and again the point of dueling was to show you were brave enough\nYou were sincere enough and your beliefs that you were willing to die for them the point of the dual wasn't to blow away your opponent in an act of anger or revenge and that's why the Alexander Hamilton Aaron Burr dual\nAlexander Hamilton shot first he shot up he missed Aaron Burr on purpose Burr had done enough\nBird enough to die he had shown he was willing to engage in a dual he was a gentleman a man of honor to defend his principles yeah yeah so ... so Alexander Hamilton shoots first Mrs on purpose\nAnd then Aaron Burr raises his pistol and blows Alexander Hamilton away I think he died two or three days later wow which is why that dual cost Hamilton his life and it cost Aaron\nBurr\nCareer and his place in a polite society last paragraph when and why did dueling die in the U.S ... when the dueling died\nLast paragraph when and why did dueling die in the U. S. how when did dueling die interesting\nWay to put it dueling in the United states died out in the first in the north because again we're smarter up here that's just the way it is\nA dueling died out first in the north beginning in the early Nineteen century it persisted for quite some time in the south of course because they're dumber than we are and the west despite the fact it was illegal in many states\nThe power of dueling\nIn redeeming reputations gave it an extended life in the realm of politics a profession that was and still is grounded on reputation\nAnd public opinion\nFor a time southerners used dueling as a weapon against northerners particularly in Congress intimidating northerners into compliance or silence by threatening them with dual challenges but the civil war dramatically change the dynamics of this kind of cross section of fighting\nViolence of that sort of lost some of its panache and Silberner ... lost a good deal\nOf their clout and for of auto there it is everything you wanted to know about dueling\nSo if it comes to that if we come so become so tribal you know at least you'll know how to do it rats um and who is the south Carolina representative who nearly beat the apple a Massachusetts\nSenator was that some nerd Massachusetts a congressman or governor nearly beat him to death on the floor of the house with this metal tip the Cain yeah yeah that's on her\nGood remote correspondents Asian three six and I will try to find that they might be giants on 'em and then Kevin Callahan writes I almost sent you this Bugs Bunny clip great minds thinking alike yeah Bugs Bunny\nAnd Yosemite Sam dueling ten o'clock folks will be back on the other side with the now and always amazing Jim\nQuarter listening to W.

are slim strict\nSon's trying to peek through but it's still a little bit cloudy and Leanne is doing a very very efficient job sweeping the sidewalk out front either that or she just trying to avoid real work inside the industrial museum I'm not sure\n[laughter] or obscene her out there for a anyway well it's dry at least during a dry run you know what I watch salary is whether or not it are careful I'm Sorry Jeff yes you know let's say a we've got a I bring that up because of course we do have increasing signs\nNo it's All right ah we've got a I bring that up because of course we do have increasing son out one completely clear out we've had a lot of these days Paul this is the time of year we get this typically uh we start out with low clouds and fog and then tries to burn off and that's what's happening right now\nWe're going to have a a southwest way which already kicking in and I'm Still going for the warmest day of the week so far Seventy one Seventy two by say around two thirty three o'clock this afternoon so are those of you that like that late season into early October you'll like this afternoon\nA couple of sprinkles perhaps the patriots game other than that or should be dry and a fairly mild for this time of the evening or for the game time then and anything else going on tonight falling back eventually to the mid fifties and then\nIt's back to a cooler northeast when we're going to go up and down up and down or back and forth back and forth with little or no rain but with temperature for the rest of the week and even into much of next week\nTomorrow is the down or back to the low sixties but again that's not bad again very comfortable forty five still looks like a C your breath or sunrise on Saturday and then back to sixty five for a high on Saturday mostly sunny skies tomorrow maybe some filtered son with the front stuck to our salt bottom line is\nEssentially no storms the next week at least then Sunday sunshine back to Seventy two Sunday looking similar\nTemperature wise to today\nAnd then Monday a little cooler again ... ... in upper sixties with the north east wind and then we begin with could be a late season I wouldn't call it a heat wave but a warm wave\nA mid seventies on Tuesday your age and maybe even a shade above eighty on Wednesday and Thursday of next week before some potential a wet weather gets here by say friday so again or not bad at all Paul we've got six twenty as the sunset today\nA with a perhaps some colors in the sky blue or a little bit of color last evening again ah for various reasons or so may see that again in a one month from today\nAh for various reasons are so they see that again in a one month from today called guess what can I ask this with dominated yesterday after about ten seconds\nMike okay again when I talk to the microphone has to be on or no one can hear me [noise] I'm All right one month from today will be November fourth\nYes it's the weekend right before the election doesn't mean anything to do with the election but it's something that we all have to do on November fourth if as long as we\nDo see November fourth or it's two days before the office 'cuse me four days before the two year anniversary of possibly the most depressing day of my life\nWhen I started the show for the entire first hour by playing a Mozart's funeral diverge requiem yes no that's not at all you have\nThat you have that queued up of on November for November fifth if you have to play it\nOh I can I can ... so what happens on November fourth\nWe set the clocks back\n... oh oh that's good good an extra hour early very good by the way when I come in Evelyn ... when I become benevolence are enough of this enough of this no more changing the clocks there's no reason to do it we're no longer an agrarian society cut it out\nKnow what they did that here is that the best thing especially where we are at a time zone I say we just leave it at daylight savings so ... keep ... from now on no changes at the clock but the future just keep it where it is right now we're on still daylight savings\nAnd just let it go because you'll still get throughout the year more daylight in the late in the evening so if if I I agree with you if we just kept the clocks where they are right now constant daylight savings all year long that would be my way of getting out of that\nAnyway uh right now Paul the situation the tropics still have the lovely lovely out there a meandering around the Atlantic for two weeks or it's just been keeping the ships that go from Europe to New York\nAround the Atlantic for two weeks or it's just been keeping the ships that go from Europe to New York us back to Europe but that's about it it's not gonna bother anyone so we really are in good

desperately seek forgiveness for that terrible terrible event in that horrible man Christopher Columbus or coming to this continent and ruining where can you imagine what a paradise this place was in fourteen Ninety One can you imagine\nI mean it wasn't he still I'm sure they had their wars in battles too but wow wow this must this was the greatest continent on earth and then came ...\nWould we still there'll be living in the peace now if that hadn't happened\nYou know well my brother in law used to talk about that you know you you you give all this praise to the Native Americans Paul for

the form our in our first on Wednesday to in the ...\nShe didn't understand that folks it's a nice for her [laughter] honestly really fill [laughter] we just hang up [laughter] anyway back to why this\nIs so important to you know we are not for profit organization we work hard all summer and we and we purchase pumpkins from our and our farm and seekonk\nAnd ah we transport those over um I have a friend ah who owns full drop arm when we're hoping that he grows corn stalks and he's incredibly generous and donates\nAbout a hundred corn stalks to us while and then um we actually had a private donor come in and procure Seventy five moms so we donate all of these things to\nNap Seventy five mothers none I'll be back a lot of moms oh chrysanthemums it was like mom okay so [noise]\nDonate all of that to the human food pantry they sell them a pumpkin corn stock ten dollars pumpkin ...\nIf your pantry they sell them a pumpkin corn stalk ten dollars pumpkin corn stock mom\nFifteen dollars if you want to buy one individually it's six dollars\nAnd here's the best part is that for every dollar that they raise they have twenty dollars worth of buying power the greater Boston food bank wow this is what we do to help\nLoad up those shelves just before the holidays get their freezer filled with turkeys and chickens and ham and everything that we can for no stinking gorge no stinking [laughter]\nSo this is a it's a big deal it's a huge deal for me personally I'm\nYou know I work with Michelle Burnette on a regular basis over at the he brand and they've actually had to add a third food pantry in the week because the need and our community do great\nSo you know I'm really hopeful that um our friends out there\nWill come and support this great cause um they also accepts regular financial donations if you want to just flipping five bucks if you don't need a pumpkin\nUm they take a non perishable food items and personal care items that day so um for me personally like I said

him sweat is not a pretty ... bills would like to like sugar\nCube fit but not me do it you know we get to meet all these great in a meeting people and honestly the response from our vendors to is that there is something truly magical about farmers market now it is not reproduced at any other market that anybody else does\nSo it is like they they're vendor on vendor conflict duels if you will and that just doesn't happen people are happy to be there the clientele that we had that customers that come in\nThen people are happy to be there the clientele that we had that customers that come in\nOn the chest grateful that it's here and they love it um you know you really form connections with people who come to the market every week you know the first six weeks this woman was enormously

received four hundred and Thirteen million dollars\nFrom his father not only did he receive another hundred and forty million in today's dollars in loans from his father\nBut that that amount the amount of money was significantly increased by a series of tax schemes that\nThe tax experts that we consulted within our reporting laying out to them said this these things go way beyond the normal tax avoidance strategies that wealthy sophisticated\nI'm a people will will employ in any event to lower their tax bill views were is this was a set of of maneuvers that were actually intended to deceive the IRS about the value of things that were being given from Fred in Mary Trump\nTo Donald Trump and his siblings\nAnd I think those are the two main\nPoints that you know there's a huge amount of money flowing not just when he was a young man but actually throughout Donald Trump's life especially when he was in a financial difficulties especially when he was taking on new projects\nI'm In the ... river of money um was fed very much so by tax evasion\nEvasion and tax digestion we're going to find ... prize winning journalist and David ...\nIt was World War speaking to three times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist David Barstow stressed been attacked by the White House for this massive experts say in New York Times about how Donald Trump I gained his well stay with us\n[noise]\nThat called old men\nTrump um the song was written but never recorded by Woody Guthrie again by Ryan Harvey Anita Franklin Tom Burrell oh I'm yes a Woody Guthrie never recorded it but it's about his landlord Donald Trump's father Fred Trump\nIn the Nineteen fifties Trump believed in the Trump on on a Woody Guthrie lived in a Trump owned apartment building in Brooklyn that says democracy now democracy now ... war the war and peace report I'm any good\nClinton that says democracy now democracy now for the war and peace report I mean he couldn't ... with the army in shape\nAnd the New York times excellent they on Trump's ... tax ... to the report has reference several reporters who did groundbreaking law on Trump mine on for\nOne of them with the late ... beret who wrote the book Trump the deals and the downfall he appeared on democracy now in June to have the sixteen and said Frank Trump financial support of Donald Trump was quote unbelievably crucial\nAnd Donald's rise to prominence\nHe opened his first office in Manhattan the rent was paid by his father's company out here on avenue Z in Brooklyn and ah everything that he did with whether it'd be the grand Hyatt\nThe grand Hyatt for example to get the financing he got the financing from to banks that his father had used used his father's relationship banker\nAnd the father had to sign the financing agreement I mean they're not going to give a thirty year old kid\nThirty five million dollars in Nineteen Seventy eight to build a hotel it has to be done with Fred's resources and Fred Trump was a great outer borough builder\nAnd really built good housing twenty thousand units totally all over ... all over Brooklyn some of them ... hours like Trump Village many of them single family homes uh that uh he had a great reputation as a builder\nHe was politically wired as the sun was I mean they played the political game both of them expertly but for the Trump was indispensable I mean even Trump Tower which comes along later\nAnd Donald's career\nCould not have been done without Fred coming in and supporting the financing of it when he opened this first casino in Italy\nAnd supporting the financing of it when he opened this first casino in Atlantic City when he when he bought the first properties least souls for the first properties for Trump Plaza his casino in Atlantic City Fred wrote down in the limo with them\nAnd signed although we sold documents nobody was going to be financing this kid developer kid casino operator was Freda was the key to all of it it's so ridiculous for him to call himself\nA self made guy when\nWas critical at the political until two I mean everything that came to Donald came through political connections and they were political connections forged\nUm and this was actually a kind of a remarkable and aware\nThat were we were when we were peeling back to where it was on this that felt it was\nLike one of these sort of gritty scams that you might see in the Sopranos right it's it's setting up this company to make um basically this huge cash gifts from for Trump to his children look like legitimate business transactions let me give you a just a really simple examples is one that we describe\nLegitimate business transactions let me give you a just a really simple example this is one that we describe and we actually show in the story the actual invoices and purchase order so you can also see for yourself exactly what I'm Talking about\nSo they set up this company all county building supply in Maine it's not a real company there's no corporate offices it's actually headquartered in the basement of Fred Trump's ... a favorite nephew\nUm ah the owners of all county building supply though we're ... for children and his nephew\nAnd off all that happened was so Fred anytime Fred Trump was going to improve his buildings um she had to buy stuff right and in this case as soon after they form this company they bought sixty boilers sixty big expensive boilers from a company in the Bronx\nFred Trump himself personally negotiated the purchase price of these boilers\nHundreds of thousands of dollars worth of boilers\nThe man who sold Fred Trump these boilers Leon these men I'm told me in an interview\nOne day he comes back to his office so there's an envelope\nAnd as a check huge check\nFrom this company all county building supply say who the heck are these guys never heard of them didn't know who they were and what that was was it was all county building supply was paying him the price that Fred Trump had negotiated\nBut then all county building supply would turn around and would send an envoy to Fred Trump for the very same boilers but the invoices padded marked up twenty thirty fifty percent more\nSo all it was doing it was basically there's just a a a a a invoice padding operation it was taking the ...\nA a a invoice padding operation it was taking the things that for Trump was already buying adding twenty thirty forty fifty hundred percent more\nAnd then charging Fred Trump for Trump was effectively overcharging himself that's what it looked like on paper but in fact all of those profits are then flowing directly to his children that's point number one\nAnd that child Donald Trump like forty county late ...\nAbsolutely absolutely and this was part of a fairly well considered an orchestrated strategy that the Trump family came up with when they realize you know we Fred Trump as he's getting up there in age she's starting to suffer some ill effects dementia or other problems and they're realizing if he dies\nAll of this empire all of the buildings and and huge amounts of cash sitting in his accounts [noise] those are going to be subject to a fifty five percent tax\nOr inheritance tax and so the idea was well wait a minute how do we how do we get how do we pull that cash out of the empire before it gets taxed fifty five percent how do we shift all of those buildings into our pockets before they get taxed fifty five percent\nAnd in this case I think one of the things in the all county building supplies in case\nThe ... and I think it it it helps you sort of see at least the mindset here is not only do they come up with this ruse basically to disguise cash gifts as a legitimate business transactions but then they submitted those padded invoices to the state regulators who govern\nUh rent increases in New York and they use those inflated invoices in order to justify rent increases for thousands of that\nThe justify rent increases for thousands of the tenants who lived in in ... uh uh apartments mostly we're talking I'm ... you know these are working class middle class folks who we are seeing are rents go up\nYou know five ten Fifteen dollars a month in part because of these inflated invoices from all county building supply and maintenance\nAnd can you speak to me about that I think he meant an end in frontline which ... made an impact and I came in the Nineteen Seventy\nSo yes so I'm so start sending is really one of the largest federally subsidized I'm a housing developments in the in the country it's massive it's even bigger than ... Trump's\nUm apartment complexes and and in the seventies when they were trying to build stare at city\nUm they needed some extra money and are looking for private investors who is basically going to be this investment that would create huge tax law says that's why rich people wanted to get in on Sterritt city it would create huge tax losses so Fred Trump to use his losses at stare at city\nTo shelter all of his profits from his empire\nSo he made an investment and to stare at city but he also made an investment for his kids as well and so Donald Trump starting at a very early age was getting these huge tax breaks from stare at city in fact those tax breaks help them avoid paying any federal income taxes at all\nIn the late Nineteen seventies and ah and then and then of course as as time progresses\nStare at Seventy is now worth a heck of a lot of money it recently sold for nearly a billion dollars and in fact that investment that Fred front made way back in the seventies is going to give Donald Trump a windfall\nThat's Fred Trump made way back in the seventies it was going to give Donald Trump a windfall of sixteen million dollars this year\nBefore we go to Frank how much money you save ... Trump avoided in taxes\nHundreds of millions of dollars\nHundreds of millions of dollars and something like this and I think he's had fifty million instead of something\nSo yeah I mean who so it's pretty simple pretty simple math right we we didn't receive that'd be transferred well over a billion dollars\nIn wealth to his ah siblings\nFifty five percent tax rate so you're talking about a tax bill unexpected tax bill around five hundred and fifty million dollars\nThe tax records that we obtained show that the Trump family paid fifty two million in a in gift in estate taxes so rather than paying fifty five percent tax rate\nPaid about five percent tax rate\nQuestion is how did they avoid the other five hundred million dollars what happened to that\nFirst of all just to be clear\nNot all of that we're not we certainly don't say in the store and we don't we don't allege anywhere that every penny of that was invaded money some of it was just usual tax avoidance measures that all rich people use\nBut certainly a very significant portion of that\nCame through tax\nSchemes and maneuvers that the experts that we consulted with said really crossed the line\nWe're going to go to Frank and then come back to this discussion what was it legal ... was improper David ... three consulates are pressuring asking him before and our lead reporter on this massive Thirteen thousand where these investigating a Donald Trump's wealth and\nWhere it came from that title Trump the engagement suspect tax gains that she ripped riches from his father that says democracy now back but they are showing them\nFrom his father but says democracy now back with the Barstow in a moment\nWhen Lulu\n[noise] you can use\nMother again do a\nFather and a\nWhole new thing [noise] you know\nHow do\nThey want more um polio rather the dry\nAnd the good old [noise]\nAnd and all around [noise]\nOh Bryan times by Roberta flak fusses democracy now I'm Amy Goodman within their means shape our guest for the hour is the three time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist David in Barstow did a massive expertise and the New York times this week that's going to be re issued on Sunday\nThe New York state taxation is already responded to the times report on Donald Trump's tax practices with a statement that it's called vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues investigation\nMeanwhile New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted I've directed NYC is department of finance to immediately investigate taxing housing violations and to work with on why state to find out if appropriate taxes were paid the mayor told reporters he is looking to recoup any money Trump ...
