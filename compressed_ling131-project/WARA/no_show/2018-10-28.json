from the bucket\nAnd I really believe we had a a spiritual breakthrough last week of all things from the book a job but anyway I really believe like repressed and\nAnd um you saw the effects and so uh I Would just like to have a time of publicly giving thanks to God for\nProtecting us this past week and I'm I'm going to have you do something we were not very ... around here we try to be formal sometimes and I can't do it\nUm you got that Bruce up their Scott\nThere's a a passage out a small one twenty four that I Would like to have you uh read and every time I raised my hand I'd like you to re read that phrase\nUm and then I Will prayer for Thanksgiving after we're done with it and here we go uh let's practice altogether if the lord had not been on our side\nOkay that's pretty good

let us be torn by their teeth we have escaped like a bird out of the polar snare and we have a skate\nIt's like a bird out of the polar snare and we have a skate our help is in the name of the lord the maker of heaven and earth let's pray heavenly father we just thank you for your divine protection this past week\nLord\nThere's what the news media says then there is ...\nWhat happened in the unseen realm lord we believe that your hand a protection was on this campus\nLord you watched over the attraction of this man to this facility you watched over the events that led to my coming in here lord I thank you that it was me and not somebody else I think you that you had your protection was on this campus\nI think you that ah he was able to leave and and did so willingly lord I thank you for the protection over our two police officers that engaged him lord I Am even grateful that you're spared his life\nHeavenly father if you had not been on our side watching over all of these events who knows what we would be doing here this morning\nIt would be completely different instead lord we thank you we give you praise truly lord the unseen Rome was interacting vibrant late Monday and we thank you publicly in Jesus' name amen\nWell the lord did not give us a spirit of fear but of power end of love and interestingly self discipline in other words he's also given us commonsense so\nIn light of everything let me updates you what is going on with our security here or worked we've been taking a two prong approach and there's been a lot going on behind this\nWe're we've been taking a two prong approach and there's been a lot going on behind the scenes\nAnd uh the very first thing and most important is actual people doing the job or we currently are ah recently approved Henry chosen to be our new head of security and he's looking for recruits you'll find this email on the bulletin and I've given him a list of names so when he calls\nYou please say yes I'd be delighted to another personnel thing is that the next\nAll team meeting in October we're going to go over protocols with all of the ... ministry department heads if you're not aware there's fifty two ministries it's a very busy campus\nUm there's a lot of moving parts here\nAnd all it takes us for one thing to break down in this case a door not closing on top of a alarmed ... not being set\nAnd uh so all of us we're going to really going to re brief everybody in October the second thing is we're going to move ahead with a um installing security cameras\nA recording device for the campus we got an estimate earlier this year and we're just going to move ahead with it and then D.C aids presidents security system will eventually be upgraded an integrated with that\nIf you're not aware we have a a school and it it currently has its own stand alone security system but we're gonna dove tail it so that we have one security system\nHere very good that aside we thank God for his protection we also thank God for his provision if I could have all of the people I asked about the mortgage shredding to come on up at this time\nThese individuals are a church council members they are members from the good steward campaign team\nThey are ministry staff have we got enough for\nMinistries staff have we got enough food and drug and and the ...\nOh here we go here we go there we go that's what we need we want to thank God that this is the mortgage of the property next door the White House next door\nAnd I'm pencils out one day everybody I'm\nForty two months ago we launched a campaign to pay off\nThe White House or the mortgage was roughly are pretty close to three thousand dollars a month and if you know anything about it in your own personal budget or if you have all if ever it's possible to have all your decisions made for you\nKnow\nWe weren't quite that bad but three thousand dollars a month is a lot of money out of our operations budget in other words how can you do outreach\nWhen you're doing this so the lord put it in our heart to pay off this mortgage as quickly as possible in the forty two months we made forty one extra payments that are obviously almost the payment amongst praise God [noise]\nNow this has saved us forty eight thousand dollars in interest\nHere's another interesting thing\nOne forty two months ago when we came to you we said all we're asking us for five dollars a month for five dollars a week\nFive dollars a week and do you know most of the contributions worth five dollars a week per person so just a little just a little bit of sacrifice on behalf of everyone here\nOh just a little just a little bit of sacrifice on behalf of every one year we say forty eight thousand paid it off and now we're able to move forward or before we read these I Want to give a special thanks to the boys and girls\nWho over the forty two months gate eight hundred and Ninety seven dollars [noise]\nLots of shredding began go ahead\nThere was a machine right there [laughter]\n\nI've got to take a while\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words that Jesus had to be fully human fully human for this\nFlash this world to be recreated in the new happens in the new earth\nNow if if the if people believed this deception\nIt would've changed from Christianity to something other than Christianity it was an attempt to deny the very foundations of Christianity by denying the historical physical Jesus look again\nMany the sabers of going out into the world they do not believe that Jesus Christ came to earth and a real body such a person has to deceive or an an anti Christ I love John's response\nNow here's an elder he's an old man by this time\nAnd he doesn't even say Hi it's John he ... he just starts out right from the beginning the one who existed from the beginning is the one we have heard and seen we saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands he is Jesus Christ the word of life\nThe old man the church affectionately called John the elder doesn't even Greece has friends who just as opening line of hey we've heard on we've seen 'em I touched him\nI Am an eyewitness sayings methods do not change the content of them changes he is still a deceive or who wants to deny something that is physically real\nChanges he is still allowed to see everyone wants to deny something that is physically real and if you think this is a must the old thing\nSt still in the deceiving business I'm going to give you two examples and a quick trigger warning because it's not these are now political\nIssues how do you answer this question these two questions determines about the level of deception you are willing to buy into number one when does life begin\n\nThinking about it this was an important question because it leaves the how you answer leads either to the dignity of human kind that we are created in the image of God or just a bunch of tissue that can easily be discarded\nThat's next one it's it's a hot button right now is gender an identity or reality how\nHow you answer that question ... ... e bleeds either to a moral rightness or wrong or sexual liberate teen\n\nSaid his message remain the same he's denying reality however in our ... our content today that it's changed it's it's ... it's all the issues that we wrestle with today but humankind believes the substance because they love gardening us\nInstead of light that's the bad news\nNews there is an enemy to artist soul he wants to see he wants to destroy our faith and he has a plan to do so but there's good news the good news and you may not see how good the news is right at the first\nBut by December you'll have it down look at Johns thesis sentence every good writer has a piece of son didn't tell you this is where I'm going here there was no difference this was the message has given us to announce dude God is light\nAnd there was no darkness in on the metaphor of ... the word picture of walking in the light is the answer to being deceived\nThe word picture of walking in the light is the answer to being just saved we know that God is wholly how Baca says that um you're too pure are to look out evil\nWe know that God is immortal Paul wrote that God is immoral and he lives in on approachable light we know that God is full of glory it says and saw him that he he wears glory like a a a coat of light\nBut John's perspective is that internal life\nLight equals eternal life excuse me and said that wrong each a light equals eternal life and he you know why because he's jumping to the end he's like hey if you want a turtle life you're going to walk in the white\nHere's here listen to the good news how John phrases that this one who is life from God was shown to us and we have seen them and now we testify\nAnd announced to you that he is the one who is eternal life he was with a father and then he was shown to us we are telling you about what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us and our fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ\nWe're writing these things so that our joy will be complete let me give you the logic got Israel\nWe've seen him God came centers son Jesus fully human and divine to earth\nOur means to eternal life\nAnd Jesus came so we can a fellowship eternal life with father and and the sun\nAnd that equals joy that's a simple as it is friends live both illuminates and exposes darkness if I had a microscope puppy or a common microscope for many high school a classroom\nCommon microscope for many high school a classroom\nThe light would go through their there'd be a reflection of light of of natural sunlight through lenses and it would magnify\nIt would expose what is dark to the human eye so that we can see it in the same way the light of God God is light and his his shining on us exposes\nUs that's not necessarily good as if you haven't heard all my stories I have one more\nDuring my teenage years my home church bought the local theater in tone\nSo we had a sanctuary building it was just a little little tiny country church like\nAnd we bought the only theater in town and it was during the Jesus people revival one and what we called it the state of Jesus center in every weekend we either showed a Christian movie or we had a Christian concert on some sort\nOr the youth met there on Tuesday nights and being youth we enjoyed running around the state Jesus center\nWith the lights off\nIn fact we played many your pastor has played many a game of hide and go seek at the state Jesus center\nAnd we often would run into walls we would\nTrip over chairs which in our knees on something I mean we're playing hide and go seek in the dark in a big building\nEvery now and then one of the sponsors would turn on one of the theatrical spotlights and\nTry to find them and we would die [laughter] light exposes things that's just point\nIs good even though it eliminates all our sins if we walk in a life where we're going to stop singing and the\nIf we walk in a life we're\nGoing to stop singing and the result\nWill be eternal life\nVersus Evans says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his son\nPurify as us from office and\nJustice sunlight kills mold so walking in the light kills sin\nIn the life of a believer the message God is light light equals eternal life therefore walk in the white well that but there's more now not only ...\nReceiving these three against them but send in and I will throw in another\nAnyway here's another point there was more good news every good writer not only introduces his letter\nOr his topic with a good these centers when he's closing at all he'll say and this was what I have said to you know unlike a preacher who says in conclusion\nIn conclusion you know Ninety five times John actually doesn't he concludes and he writes this I write these things to you who believe this was in his last chapter I write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of God why so\nThat you may know you have eternal life\nJohn is a pastor at heart he seeks to assure his friends that they may know for sure that they are going to have eternal life\nIt's as if he is saying look if you don't believe my testimony if you don't believe I saw the rhythm art if you don't believe I ate with him after he rose from that that if you don't believe any of that\nYou can still know for sure that you're gonna have eternal life here and there is verification and we're going to go through these in the next couple of months [noise] there's an assurance of eternal life\nIn the next couple of months\nThere's an assurance of eternal life amoral ... verification walking in the white there was a relation no verification walking in love this is the great love book guys\nIt's all in the love one another is in this book several times there is a scriptural verification walking in through this is what it means to be a believer we are going to walk in the light and soon will disappear\nNow as we go through the sermon we're going to examine and test and verify the truth of walking and the lights and by the way there are rewards for walking in the white\nAnd each one of them has its own ... uh rewards but anyway um the story is told of a of a nomad in the desert and he was sleeping in his tent one night and they got hungry\nSo he lit a candle and uh there was a plate of dates beside as bad so he he took a bite out of one end of the date and there was a worm in it so he threw it off the tongue

a in a positive way and your relationship with God\nA very quickly I Want to share with you or\n\nI Want to share with you out of five and Romans chapter Romans chapter tens\n\nChapter ten first a Seventeen the apostle Paul is talking about faith and how we get face\nIt says ... comes from hearing the message and the message has heard through the word of crisis and I've\nAnd the message is her through the word of rights\nAnd I thank God for the opportunity to steady the word of God not only on a Sunday Morning\nNot only personally but also the opportunity to study the word of God with someone who study it up for a long time and with someone who admitted that\nThe focus to not only educate themselves but to educate others and the word of God so if you want to have additional face if you want your face it to grow\nThe steady of the word of God is very important and as a as a church we're trying to offer you numerous opportunities for you to come to study the ...\nAnd we know Sunday Morning does its part and we know throughout the week that many of your work many of you have responsibilities so if I offer something on a Tuesday Morning not everyone will be able to obtain\nSo choose the morning you would come to a Bible study and and Tuesday evening you could come to a this new pass away of freedom that we all Frank on a Wednesday\nAh I really want you to come and try pasta\nRogers Bible study you'll be blessed by it and those of you who've attended it you know it's good you know it's great pasta Roger has been a great friend to me it's been a mentor to me\nA as a pastor now I consider my pastor at times when I'm feeling a little frustrated filling happy and then we'll get together and he'll help me see things that I'm not quite seeing so\nUh I think God for sending him back here and I thank God for allowing him to do the ministry that he's doing in the church joined the Wednesday evening at seven\nUh I really encourage you to come\nAnd then Wednesday evening at seven uh I really encourage you to come and study with them or your faith will grow in a way that you will be amazed because he will help you understand the word of God\nSo I think a\nMaster Roger for his commitment to God's ministry at this time at Memorial Baptist and I invite you to join his Bible study if you haven't already\nTo this morning we're gonna talk on a subject that's very important because you're trying to do it every day or just you you're supposed\nTo say you do it every day but before I get into it I'm often amazed when I ask people\nWhat the tea you know have you ever watch individuals who have a wonderful relationship with one another or whether it be a a marital relationship of friendship or ... and if you want to ask them what's the secret sauce how do you get to have a good relationship\nBecause\nYou just passing through and God's lights and likewise gotten just passing through and you're like radically you know you ... you know\nIs just passing through in your life radically you know you you you may pause and you ask for a favor from a stranger but they tend to be something substantial\nBecause you don't have that kind of relationship with a stranger perhaps you may say okay I Need to get through excuse me and the person step to the side and the person let you\nGo out of your merry way and ah\nSo you asked for a favor their granted to you but it's not something substantial\nSo if you have a relationship with God which is that over strangers okay imagine I see a stranger on the street\nIf I tell him to excuse themselves so I could pass through most likely he will comply unless\nYou know I give them the wrong by unless I asked the wrong way I Would imagine that same stranger who just comply to let me passed through because I ask it in a great tone of voice in the great matter imagine I cause I just\nWould you let me borrow a thousand dollars\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa where's that coming from I don't know you\nIt's like you know with strangers there's certain things I couldn't ... with a certain things I cannot go ahead you because we don't have that kind of relationship\nThat's why I say\nYou cannot have communication without a relationship and the relationship will determine what you could talk about\n\nLike why the certain things are going to announce the stranger you cannot you cannot not ask for strangers some\nPersonal information you know what's your blood type ... where are you going with that\nOh I'm from Michigan you know what's your blood type ... where are you going with the\nSet up so\n\nThat was imagine that a\nYear to people who work together you have a professional relationship that in a professional relationship you know I'm every Monday through friday you talk about professional stuff work related stuff\nMaybe friday before work and\nYou might say oh I have a great weekend you know I really you know go enjoy yourself you know you might offer some wonderful a wishes to the person\nCome Monday when their combat as co worker you might change if you gossip hearing that a few things you know but nothing ... or those serious because it's a professional relationship\nOkay imagine you have a professional relationship with God right\nEverything is so formal everything's work related uh you know there's certain things you could never get into the gods as a professional relationship\nAnd there's certain things that you know it's not because the person does not have the capacity to be a black guy but he's a professional relationship and then when you reach\nCertain activities that might be normal in a different relationship you got ...\n\nIn a professional relationship that certain things you could not talk to the person about certain things you cannot say okay let's go and do it together because you know he's a professional relationship\nPrayer is sort of like that\nIf you maintain a relationship with God it's going to be awkward\nWere asking but you don't really have paid for what you're asking for because you know it was out of the bounds because lots on your camera and and your wife\nAsking for because you know it was out of the bounds because lots on your camera and and your wife you know\nA ... there was no solid foundation\nFor what you are asking for and likewise got cannot come and talk to you because you keep it a professional relationship now they're maybe they're maybe things that God is able to grant you within a professional relationship\nRight but they they're gonna be things that he's not going to a branch of the things I look at you you're going to be uncomfortable coming to talk about\nThe imagine you have\nA profound oh\nIntimate relationship with a person now think about what sort of conversation do you have with that person you talk about all kinds of different\nAnd it's all most all different times some of them might be trivial some of 'em are just so profound that okay the conversation gets to be a little tense and some of it or they might be life transformative things\nAnd there are certain demands that you make from that person that you would never dare ask someone else\nAnd there are certain times you make the phone call you know\nAnyone else you wouldn't dare call at this time but without crossing your good because you know we have that kind of relationship so\nYou cannot have prayer which I'm call of the communication of conversation outside of a relationship\nAnd based on the relationship that you have then you will know how that relationship will end up the communication and the top of the communication that you can\nHow that relationship will end up the communication and the top of the communication that you could have with the process and what you could ask what you cannot\nSo with these things in the back ground let us go through the tax settled to go through the tax and then think about how God how you work with ... and how God works would you uh\n\nJames size is any one of you in trouble here should try is anyone happy let them sing songs of praise is any one of your sick\nYou should call The Elders of the church to pray over him and annoys him with oil and the name of the law and the prayer offered and face will make the sick person well the lord will raise them up\nIf he had sent you will be forgiven therefore confessional since through with shelter and pray for each other so that you may be killed what James is saying is this program is so important that he\nOught to be done all of the time under any and every situation\nFor average so important it ought to be done all the time under any and every situation but because privates like communication or conversation it's going to happen in the context of the relationship that you have with the person\nThen how we engage in that conversation is important and its relationship is any one of you in trouble\nThere are a lot of troubles that'll taking place in the world\nThere are a lot of troubles that are taking place in the world I feel bad for them\nBut in my ways of thinking I'm like well that's not my problem\nAnd that certain problems you have that certain people you're not going to call you cannot called\nOK you imagine you've got a flat tire in the middle night\nYou're not going to call someone that you don't have a profound relationship\nYou imagine that you have you know a serious financial difficulty you not gone to a ball there's someone that you don't have a profound relationship with someone who having an intimate relationship what they're going to know about your flat tires whenever that happened\nYou know if they're in bed wake them up\n'cause I'm In trouble it's not anybody else who for me I can come to you because you know we have that kind of relationship so what kind of relationship do you have we got\nYou know it\nIs God the person who hear your prayers last\nBecause in some ways you already know that you can't even bring those things will God's or you have already brought those things for your financial consultant you would already brought those things where you'll say or if it's you you already brought those things to your friends and soccer even bring those things to strangers and there's\nOh none of 'em could have helped let me call got about\nImagine you have an intimate relationship with somebody and then they have already bring all the issues to someone else\nAnd then it's later one that you're going to hear about it honestly how you're gonna feel\nLater one that you're going to hear about it honestly how you're gonna feel\nYou're going to feel\nLike they don't trust you you're going to feel like for some reason\nThe conception you have about the relationship is not quite what it is because if that trust you if they believe in you if they're comfortable with you if the easy to talk to you than you would have known about this if the if the only reason you're not hearing about it is because they don't feel comfortable coming to\nMy brothers and my sister's a relationship with God is which is my main point will determine how we talked about how we behave around\nOne idea where if God comes through you\nWhile you're driving your car and give you the right idea you fix that problem so you may think you have money problem you don't have money problem you have one idea from the lord way\nThere's there's well I I have this issue if God wants to come to you and give you that one I did that only God can [noise]\nIf God wants to come to you and give you that one I did that only God can get your solution will ... so that's why he was he wants to spend time with you\nBut when you're already comments that I knew what I Want to know what I Want is I I'm not I'm not going to give your leftovers I'm not going to give you a second\nBest I Want you to be connected back to me and then once you're connected back to me and at times when you less expect that I'm gonna tell you how I'm going to care for you I'm going to tell you how I'm going to provide for you and I'm going to tell you know what\nYou're not going to have anything but I'm going to give you the piece that you need in the middle of this problem like into fall\nWill be what sustain you know sometimes we don't like to hear it\nWhere it says my voice was staying you because I Will renew your mind enable you to enjoy life\nFocusing on things that that matters to me focusing on things that matters I suppose of the things that you don't have as opposed to the things that are ultimately that do not matter\nMy brothers and my sisters God tells us\nThat prayer is powerful forever is effective when it's done by righteous person and I should which you are the reason why he says the righteous person it's not just talking about the piracy as much as that is important but he's also talking about people who understand what it is\nIn prayer cannot be separated from the relationship\nAnd the relationship will shape sit as shapes the relationships because lots of times the greatest thing that God will do for us to change your thinking you won't change your financial situation first you want\n\nYou won't change your financial situation first you won't change your physical situation for us but it's going to change your thinking\nAnd I was telling you some of them you\nKnow telling God do more joy\nTomorrow\nThen I Will do this in God's has already give you the day go enjoys a no no no change there's been a lot of joy says no no I Want to give it to you\nSo that things that got over to give to you guys and to me and he's telling us to\nWork on those things appreciating those things maximizing those things and change our perception around those\nMore and more\nAs I\nAs I read broadly not only within ... Christian scriptures and Christian communities writing and read outside of it yeah the reading this thing we're talking about you know how do you enjoy life how do you stop all this negative things oldest is that really brings you down\nAnd then you know that frame it in their own way but it comes down to\nStop enjoy the now that you have in front of your stop enjoy it give thanks to it quickly realize what they're saying is\nFor us when we pray that is what we do when you pray correctly what do you do you pause and the knowledge that you have somebody who is greater than you and your life and you have somebody\n\nStopped hear you on your try that you could bring all your\n... who stopped\nHearing you on your trial that you could bring all your burdens too that you could talk about every and somebody who was over who's going to open your ah not only to the difficulties that you have and tells you that he has a covered but also showing you the wonderful things that you have\nAn ... sometimes you're going to come and you're going to confess things that are when you die and sometimes you're going to go and you're going to practice grits furnace giving thanks right and sometimes you gonna come you're going to praise the lord\nBecause you cannot do something with that keeping some of it to yourself let me give you an example tried getting excited\nAnd worship service and still be depressed for that moment try\nTry bringing joy to the lord and not have it you know so it's impossible\nBecause as you doing it to the law that's what you ask me to do with God that God is not this person who's so uh uh you go to stick\nTo go just to go and just worrying about people doing things for him he asks you to do it because he knows and you're doing it for him you don't want to have at yourself\nBecause when you pause and you begin to confess\nPeople pay good money to go to a therapist confess the wrongdoing and sometimes if they don't go through a therapist to call you\nDon't you have friends call you were telling you about a death sentence because they don't look entering you as they look in you as a as a confidence\nRight am I the only one\nBut in you as a as a confidence right am I the only one\nNone of your friends who called you and says just what I did the other day the country's was bothering them they need to talk about the telling you because they know you're not going to lift the the information out but then if you talk about it\nI tell you to go and praise or I don't want to cry when you're going for what you're going to do what you're gonna confess whatever it is that that's in there it's going to bubble up and you don't need to pray about it you need to tell another friends about it because really telling God the right person\nDon't you have some moments where you want to shout and get excited and you want to share with somebody\nThat exercise when you happy like that\nShot through the law which is pride bring it to the law because it's not it's not every day a friend who's going to be available and sometimes it's not every day that are friends don't want to see him being so jubilant and excited about that and it's because some people are jealous\n\nDon't you have moments sometimes where you want to give thanks\nFor something you want to uh uh ... all the things that you were grateful for because in doing so with the help you\n[noise] well that's my primary\nWhen you go to the lord sometimes in your pauses as you know I'm really grateful for what you've done for man and and and I'm Glad for the fact that okay if it wasn't on my side there's no way I Will be here if it wasn't you who have gotten the adult this empathic\nThat hopefully no one else no except me and you I I wouldn't be thank you for that\nThank you for the fact that I got into traffic because my mind was somewhere else\nAnd you allow\nBecause my mind was somewhere else\nAnd you allow me to get into a traffic without another call coming up the same time thank you for the fact that I didn't get into an accident but somehow others have been killed by but somehow in some way you preserve my life so I Know it's not me being smarter and I know it's not just to make\nIt off the call I Know someone was looking out for\nThank you for the fact that before you let something happened to me somehow you give me a full morning about it\nSome of us should be told\nThe troubles that we've got ourselves into God did warn us about it you got about it later on when you're dealing with the consequences but truth be told God did warn you about it\nSo thank God thank God for the fact that the Holy Spirit every now and then\nAs you're doing right now are you telling you about something telling you about a a way of change in your life away of pausing and acknowledging what's important\nIs what prayer to pray forces\nYou to pause and acknowledge what's important in your life and this rock race mean we we reliving sometime we were running around we don't even know why are we running around but when you pause and pray and what doesn't do it helps you prioritize that which is important\nAnd then having prioritize ... which is important what do you do you commit yourself to do something about it as God is doing what only God can do about\nIt if you live by those principles given to you you like tennis but improve\nDo you have until you your life cannot but improve\nBecause sometimes we are in this downward spiral\nIf you would pause\nAnd pride God would stop negative thinking God would stop all this worrying and infighting because God was a I got this thing covered\nAnd if you were to pause and confess some of the guilt feelings that you're carrying will will be lifted from you if you were to pause\nYou're listening to W.

is taking place sometimes you just don't know what it is but all we know is that Jesus and God God is in control\nReally ... it you know you got to really believe that you know we're thinking about what's going on in our lives right now what we're seeing around us in the news and everything but we have to understand and realize that God is in control\n[noise] um [noise] um tonight we got um [noise] the jets tapestry\nAnd ... coming to the upper um they're great band um if you haven't heard them before\nUm and they've been they've actually played at the upper rooms several times and will give me a chance to hear a little bit about them right now just tapestry and ... and I'm looking for them as I speak to you right now because you know it's funny we have them here we have them recorded\nAnd the funny thing is is that sometimes are here they are\nSometimes things get moved around and we just don't know where where they go but\nIf you haven't had a chance to hear them we're going to give me a chance right now I'm here on hot rock radio the judge tapestry and stumble tonight at the upper room a free admission and will tell you also that um the revival that's taking place

no\n\n\nNo no no no we didn't\nAnd I\nI don't know\n\nYou know oh well I'm\n\n\nWe we\nWere there\n\nCan get the the the tolerated monitor\nSo it was in the changes that wasn't anything to do with what I was doing the things were changing because what I was surrendering ...\nSo as I stepped out further and further I Know they're slowly I was starting to see the fear but what I did when I felt fear I started to surrender and the more that I started to acknowledge the things I was afraid of\nAnd surrender it all of a sudden those same fears did not exist so where I'm going with this Mike one I think is happening in our political system is what has\nTo happen to the individual meaning war I went through also is now happening without politician and our government because if we don't align ourselves with principals\nPrinciples that Jesus God laid out universal principle system will experience a total shut down and Mike what I really believe is the communication that I ...\n... and my what I really believe in communication on August twenty no magic Mary structures or hurt and my dream on August twenty\nConstruction period and I believe is happening with our political system\nI think it's also not only with the country as a whole I think of the country as a whole is like one could be like one person or one body and we're all part of the body in the country the usa but were citizens of the body of price were part of the union of God\nBut the thing is is that the people with in the body I mean the past as I heard three passes said that so far that um\n[noise] you know in the beginning of the year I think even as recently as last month that\nThere would be one day where the financial system the way we know it will crumble and that they will be a new economy on this earth and it would be the economy of love\nAnd economy where um you know we do that's why ... that's why it's it teaches it teaches in the Bible about loving one another and doing things for one another um surrendering a show slaying are still dying to sell so we can help other people\nUm it because that's the economy of love see right now what we're doing is we're too much into the me me me and you and when we make in the in the ... and especially now when we we go to the polls if for those of us that that vote and I'm not criticizing I'm just saying this is something to think about\nBut this was something that came to me this morning when I got out of breakfast this morning with sue\nIs that you know as I was walking back home\nUm you know God gave me this is you know we make poor choices and not so much in the political realm but everything we do in our lives\nPoor choices and not so much in the political realm but everything we do in our lives\nYou know I'm you know when all of a sudden it's okay to do this it's okay to do that it's okay to again I'm not judging but this is something to think about and sometimes got allows things to happen to kind of ... or get our attention\nYou know we make poor choices we elect leaders who make decisions based on their own agendas and all like well you know Jesus was saying to me one time in a dream back in March that I had\nUm you know you guys brought this on yourselves\nNow in the dream that I had um I'll share this with you 'cause it's really you know I think this might be important I had a dream that I was in a in a in the house that I grew up in when I was probably about six or seven years old and my parents when I when I you know first years of my mother and father were married we lived in this\nBack then apartments were really like basically whole houses but on the second floor\nYou know it's not like now when you get an apartment you get four rooms and your work you can squeeze two people in them I mean it was different back then\nBut I'm In the stream\nIt felt like all the people in my church or squeezed in this apartment [laughter] you know that when I grew up and\nAnd everybody was all chaotic Li like ... running around or something and um and I saw Jesus in the kitchen like standing up against the the um you know the pantry or not the pantry but you know the cupboard where you put the dishes and the food and all that and there\nWere any way um and as he was speaking nobody was really paying attention because they were all on their own personal agendas running around all confused scared worried and whatever and I was paying attention I was watching from the sidelines and he said you people brought this on yourselves\nAnd then um he says the this isn't my fault you for you people\nAnd then um he says the this is my fault you for you people did this and then he looked at me and he said you need to tell people to pray for the United states of America\nYou need to tell people to pray for the United states of America\nAnd since then I've told pastors locally I've told past his friends I have friends you know in all the all ... in Australia\nHas told 'em I've told every pretty much everybody radio church um you know anywhere I get a chance to speak with a microphone I think that we need to get out of ourselves and start to pray\nFor the United states of America of this country was founded on godly principles and I'm sure that you know the fourth founders\nI'm like George Washington and um you know what's what Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin all them guys I'm sure they probably just saying wait a minute this is what we envision that I'm sure because when they were created this country and I'm not going to get too much in the politics but\nGod showed me this thing that ... that Thursday night when I was praying\nWhen we when we're in this country was founded it was founded on his system the government was founded in the system of checks and balances and that's why we have an executive branch which is the president we have a legislature branch which is Congress we have a judicial branch which is the house of or Supreme Court and obviously um I don't think they ever envisioned\nUm Congress or one of them or both\nAll of a sudden saying you know what I don't agree on this so therefore nothing's gonna happen I don't think they planned on this happening and I sat there and I said gee you know I I did some research I says the government never closed down anymore since the nineties because obviously we know that this happened in in the nineties when Bill Clinton was president\nAnd I said no I couldn't find anything and I says you know it took the moment\nAnd I said no I couldn't find anything\nAnd I says you know it took them almost two hundred years for all of a sudden now they'll be there to be a kink in the ... why is there a kink in the arm of think about what's going on in our society right now\nAll of a sudden you know you're trying to take God out of the prayers in the schools are trying to take God out of reach your God we trust um it's okay to do all these different things and again I'm not judging this was just something to think about [noise]\nYou know it's okay to do all this stuff will not put God first when I when I was a kid back in in the early sixties or late sixties you know there was no nothing was open it was that was church day and that was it\nAnd then you only sensual things were open you know and I'm sure you can attach to this to Greg so now the country more and more is trying to take God out of the picture and again not judging just something to think about [noise]\nBut now look what's happening and this is why we need as a nation to pray for the United states of America [noise]\nI Can't stress I don't I I don't want to predict or to I I just not my place to tail or predict what's gonna happen but I think what I think this is happening the get our attention to say okay you know it's like me personally when I wasn't walking and falling price [noise] the way I should be [noise]\nGod Forbid something in my life to get my attention and that was you know almost almost getting me in an accident and then in ... you know just the God does different things to get our attention he doesn't want to harm us or hurt us but sometimes if we don't pay attention he's going to keep ... listen to say okay now\nI got your attention what are you going to do about it\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] what I'm saying if we really take a look at it you know even people\nEnd up under\nLook at it you know even people who are\nAre in a place of not understanding because\nI don't understand but what I only have to do Mike is just look around if I really look around not only in the world but if I take a moment and look at what's happening\nInside of me and I'm honest with it the one thing I'm learning\nYou know when something happens in my life go inside your your yourself for us and just ask the question to get my feeling fear\nAnd fear can manifest in anger frustration anxiety lies I've been there I catch myself when I Do it now Mike\n... what I'm realizing is when I feel afraid when I feel the experience of being frustrated how do I ... how do I act what emotional state\nWhen I'm In fear when I'm frustrated when I'm lying when I'm trying to manipulate someone what happens at my outside world then\nNose\nYeah not a good Michael Jackson impersonate I Know but the word that the words to that song are just\nPhenomenal they'll knock you ride on your back side if you really stop and take a look at them wow because\nWe need we really do and Greg was talking about this earlier how we need we need to do we do need to take care of ourselves we need to look at how we're responding we need to look at how we're reacting but we cannot do it on our own [laughter] and he just cannot do it on our own\nDon't want to resonate with what you're saying\nOh besides the fact that it's true\nIt's true it's true [laughter] correct [laughter] but what I really believe\nIn my whole whole how can I change a system that governs the people I Know and myself I'm screwed up\nHow can I have a leader who has the same issues I have a whole\nHas stuck with me\nLeadership is in a outside the it's a personal thing and once I decide and begin to experience quote the tone leader is then I have hope [laughter]\nMm\nGood great I liked that because you know there's a lot of us out there I don't think that\nThat's good great I like that because you know there's a lot of us out there I don't think that we're I don't know if I like the words screwed up but I mean that's a great great not only the only\nUsing it in my case my honestly I always ask functional\nYes that's it but I think what it is to Greg I think on a better way of putting it because I I think a better way to put it spiritually and our times is confused\nAnd the research for the correction and ... and the reason\nBeing is because people don't know any better because all the way they\nBrought oh Hey Mike I didn't mean to ... I Know better\nHold it now when I was in my stuff not everything but some of the things I Know better yeah I Know what I did it yeah see I'm not going to leave I Am not going to make excuses for myself I knew when I was doing wrong yeah\nI Know\nBut you know what though I think there's a lot of um there's a lot of 'em are false I'm a misguided I'm a\nConfusion nowadays that that um people are they like they think that what they're doing and and and how they're doing it is the correct way and you know and um and they just don't know any better and they don't realize that\nYou know Jesus Says in his word and and again this is just food for thought you know the wages of sin is death\nYou know and everyone seems to think we live in a world now that everything goes and nothing is you know everything's cool and oh yeah it's a great\nThing about it [laughter] you know think about it you know it's\nInteresting Louis [laughter] someone told me recently were not punish for a second punish by power\n[noise] [noise] [noise] by our [laughter] [noise]\nWell I think Greg too is that it's about what's in our heart and and again to I said it's like growing up plant\nAnd I'm not saying we're plants but it kind of almost ... metaphor for ugly it works out that way that when you grow in in ... in the society is like the soil\nAnd when we growing a soil or were brought up in a soil that it's okay to do all these things and now all of a sudden ... you know we don't have to pray pray to God and and schools or or it's you know and we get away from God and and uh we get away from values and we get away from a morality and all this stuff\nAnd now all of us on what's the plant grow up to be the ... the fruit is weak there's no nutrients in it\nUm the plants wizard um I don't know it's just that's just my take\nOn it what do you think well as well um\nI see and I understand what you're saying and I can\nPut a little bit of yeah you're right in there [noise] but the the\nFact of the matter is is that God has placed\nEternity in all of our hearts and so there is no excuse and it's not so that there's no excuse the problem that gets back\nTo Adam and Eve where everyone\nWants to be like God and is number one if I denied that God exists\nNumber two if I denied that there is an enemy out there that have loads and despises God\n[laughter] more than me [noise] um [noise] [noise] we [noise]\nOur own died so it's not that I don't [noise] for anyone else doesn't know what\nI don't [noise] for anyone else doesn't know what's right and wrong we just want to be God and our own lives we want to make that decision for ourselves therefore if God doesn't exist\nThen I can roll my own life but what\nI don't understand is is that there is an enemy out there that can't be seen and any time you reject God for whatever reason you're actually worshipping him Mm So when you [noise]\nTake your heart and mind and but this is what I Want and it becomes selfish not only does it take the worship away from God it does not give you the worship it gives the worship to our enemy right and\nThat's the other\nThat's the other spiritual thing that's missing in this day in time and our is recognizing that we have a spiritual enemy\nThat\nGets all the glory for himself that he can however he can and if he can't get it for himself he just wants to take it away from God and that in itself as a victory for him and we\nForget we forget that we have a spiritual enemy that we're in a spiritual battle you know you have a disagreement with your spouse or your neighbor or your boss for\nEating the bus driver whatever you know it could be anybody the guy out walking the dog you know you have a disagree\nNo it it can be anybody the guy out walking the dog you know you have a disagreement with somebody that's not because that person is your enemy it's because you have an unseen enemy\nWho's driving you and you're letting him do it ... you're letting him get away with it and and you're letting him be your God when you think you are\n... and God needs to be we need to give God the glory you know I'm not saying this to give our enemy any glory\nI'm saying they were to to make people aware because the the secrecy of our enemies victory is in the secrecy of his moves\nMhm and if you don't believe he's out there he's already won\nIn in the attacks come subtly ... which is why we have to pray for all of the\nPile of foundations and pillars of our society we have to pay pray for our homes our marriages we have to pray for a job to pray for our\nOur bosses our economy we have to pray for our country I mean this or you know so many things that we need to ah to pray about our president she yeah we need to pray for our present you know there's so many people that are quick and you see it on Facebook a lot for those view them there\nUm with so many things out there about Facebook on Facebook about this crisis that we're going on now\nWe're going on what they are today is what they say six or five whatever it is that the government shutdown and all the things that are going on which you know up meanwhile\nYou know I think that all the media is just simply just hop and all over this trying to make it worse to and and just trying to build up the the um you know whatever it is to make it out to be\nUh no I'm you know whatever it is to make it out to be on the animosity yeah exactly when what we need to do is we need to turn in a movie and say okay\nWhat God are you trying to show us here in this\nYou know as as followers and believers in Christ which is more powerful than any government on earth and then um and I can certainly shake I think God's trying to do is just shake up this this whole system and saying hey this is some flaws yeah I think that's what's going on\nPretty much I actually do oh go ahead Greg Noll I interrupt you know you can you can go ahead because you might have something\nWell you know as I listen to you and low if I ah and the idea came in my mind that ball crowd um mentality you know you can get a crowd going by a spiking\nFear uh-huh\nPanic panic and I think in general if you look at it the media does that ... to get a crowd going it's box fair to spot truth because\n\nMm\n\n\n\n\nWho\n...\nWho [noise]\nYou are listening to W. A. R. S. Thirteen twenty am Adel borrow noticed that Mike or or\nVice versa or either I say something and you've already wrote it down or you ... you wrote it down and I just seeing it on the radio\nThat track so when you mentioned something about the structures\nI had a strong feeling to again\nRead was told to me and I'm just state ordinary man no attachment I Do not I'm not interested in any powerful position but I there's one thing I Do know now yeah God uses all of us even people that I might\nNot expect but this is what happened again Saturday morning\nThree fifty am on August twenty fifth the two words came to my mind the reconstruction period ... afterwards is what happened matching every structures structures that are real structures that are now\nStructures that are real\nStructures that are now being built on earth as it is and having\nThe structures are serious\nDon't doubt them in your mind and heart protecting structures as God protects you tell people about these structures share this with your past or present an ordinary men\nPray about these structures don't allow one day to pass without telling someone about these structures ... this is your father sharing this with you more hold the broadcast\nSignal is about to change\nThe changes represent changes in the atmosphere also this change will affect people from all over the land in different ways represents the changes and man's heart and soul\nShip is communication with pastor Perry and your friends now thank you\nExactly what I heard Mike\nYeah that's exactly as Walter Cronkite would say that's the way it is [laughter] so um why don't we do this because we're we're a music show here will and breaking up a little bit with some a couple of songs yeah maybe come back more discussion but um you know folks we're not trying to tell you one way or the other on how to believe\nOr how to think\nOr how to act really that's not a place to tell you what to do but we are um hopefully trying to give me some insight or some food\nTo maybe she won to think about and pray about if you ever hear something whether it's from us from a pastor at church from a priest or any person um and you have this ...\nChurch from a priest or any person um and you have this question in your mind about what is this from God what is this about take a few steps back I think I was sharing this with someone the other day maybe it was you Greg I forgot\nIf we're not sure about something pray about it ask God to show you what's going on [noise] half God the show you what we what you need to do right now in regards to what's going on in ... or God to exploit me well if you asked stuff if you ask God in prayer and come to him or this and sharing open heart\nAnd and willing heart to be humble to learn to seek him and to seek the truth he will provide you with the truth and the truth shell set you free as it says that in his word the truth will set you free\nSo I'm saying this is not as um you know that we're right or wrong or anything but the thing that we're trying to just say is to make you aware that there's something going on\nAnd that and you need to take this information pray about it and for them what God is trying to tell you you ain't got as a personal God\nSo I think each of us it's not one I think it's you know what's clear to one person may not be so clear to another person because God Speaks to us individually on a one on one basis um that's why it's relational not not really the religiosity\n'em and nothing against religion ... out there but I just think that um we need to have that relationship no matter what church or denomination that we go to or fall under [noise]\nUm so pray about it has got to show you what is going on what he wants you to take from this that's going on in our world in our society and with that you know it's funny because I just think it would be setting to play this you know the Michael Jackson peace\nWhat do you think what do you think right [laughter]\nThe what do you think we think Greg rate I read I Will play that and then we'll come back we'll also hear from cross purpose um which is coming up to the upper room will tell you when they're coming up and um and we'll be back with more here on our rock radio\n[noise]\nYa [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nHold on to you are you going to make an argument going on may be an ally\n[noise] never\nRemember [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\nYeah [laughter]\n\nI don't know\n\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n[noise] on [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere are you\nYou know\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nAnd\n\nCut them either you're able\nLaugh at all\n\nOh righty we got um we had a couple track yeah we just played we heard from a cross purpose\nA couple of tracks here that we just played we are from a cross purpose we heard from a husband and wife team called corpus not to be confused with cross purpose they played at the upper and before we heard from a a Michael Jackson with man in the mirror\nI'm trying to get us sometimes to just focus on ourselves up for a change rather pretty interesting discussion\nUm today so far about\nI'm just some things to think about um in terms of what's going on in the government and in our world in our society um you know there's so many different things that the um [noise]\nYou know the enemy comes to kill Rob steel and destroy and we are not in a war where it's a conventional type of war where we can actually see someone coming at us with a gun or driving at us with a tank you know I'm the spiritual plane is different than the physical plane but it's very much real\nAnd we can ... you know and um that's why we need to be ... up our weapons are are a prayer\nAnd um and it says in his word that we need to always be I'm a praying praying without ceasing um you know for us to have that understanding and knowledge and and of course meditating and the word word of God you know someone asked me the other day about\nUm [noise] um [noise] you know about the Bible\nKnow and there was saying well gee you know the Bible is just something that was written by\nA man and it had not you know this is the signal is is making faces I have to admit I made the same face when I heard that and you know sometimes you know I think that the enemy will use or someone to say something to kind of say okay the world now is waiting for your response to what you're going to say back\nUm and really it it's a carefully delicate situation that if you say the wrong thing\nTo carefully delicate situation that if you say the wrong thing one of those two biggest things I ever ever a was taught when I first got into radio ... years ago um when Abraham Lincoln was president I mean I'm when I was a kid\nWas that you don't talk about religion or politics on the radio\nAnd I you know and sometimes we can um you know we open up a whole big can of spaghetti O's and worms and stuff and um you know if we you know but I think what it is is that we um [noise]\nYou know the ... ... this is how I feel personally I mean you may be one of them people that are out there saying gee the Bible is just a bunch of words it was written by men um to try to control all the people I've heard that line before\nI think maybe some point I may have said that myself I don't know maybe if I get some day I'll only remember when I go back to heaven and got plays the tape and the great editing room of life\nBecause you know our lives will be reviewed more than one day you know and and um you know hopefully that point in that stage we will be humble and have a forgiving heart because one of the things that were judged by as what's in our heart [noise]\nUm you know more so than what we did if we have a repetitive hard then you know our son's can be a forgiving\n[noise] but um you know\nWhen someone asks you or tells me that this is my my personal belief is that the Holy Spirit\nRight which God inspires through the Holy Spirit man to write the Bible it if spirit um we call it I'm\nInspired spirit thank you well spiritually inspired and you'll notice that whenever you read it when you are the ... when you were born in the spirit when you become a born again believer\nWhen you were born in the spirit when you become a born again believer and you're following Christ in the spirit I just me and Greg we're having a conversation I think it was just recently as yesterday [noise]\nAnd the words of the Bible sometimes just jump out on the page to see because to me the Bible is the love language or the love letter of God to us and it's also our instruction manual I'm to life\nOn earth how we should live our life probably should handle things and then and then they can pretty much almost covers everything [noise] um if we really you know study it and we'll look at it um\nAnd I know a lot of times you know it's easy and we go to church will open up the book once a week and say oh well it's you know this is great and then go home put it off on the side and not open it up again till next Sunday [noise]\nUm but it's a it's a daily walk and its way how God communicates to its you know like for example your friend communicates to you or your husband or wife communicate you with a cell phone\nWill think about things to think of the Bible is like a cell phone\nIt's how God communicates to he talks to you ... shows you love and and nurturing through the spoken word in the Bible and when you read the Bible pray\nNow I'm a pray that the ... the Holy Spirit will show you and teach you what needs what you need to learn or or hear or you know how something when ... new life maybe the spirit might just guide and direct you [noise] um\nI you know that's just how it works for me\nAnd I think when I explain it and how it is for me and how it means to me I told this person I'm not saying that you're saying is is wrong but I Do know this that Jesus said that he is the truth the way the truth and the light and no one's incomes who got unless they go through him\nAnd I'm not saying any who's to say that there's not any\nGod and let's stay go through him and I'm not saying any who's to say that there's not anything else that is right or wrong it's not my place or anyone else's place here on earth to judge but it's only I I can only say what I Do\nAnd um and you You're welcome to check it out for yourself and formulate your own opinion\nAnd that's not being critical that's not forcing my beliefs

on or my wife's got to work on on Sunday so I Can't go to church on that day I I don't know but all I can just say is try to that this could be the this could be God calling his people together\nYou know the enemy knew exactly what to do and how to press my buttons and he put put the most prettiest beautiful woman in my face and I dated every one of them back then and I would get hurt and it would distract me away from what God wanted me to do and you know and as soon as God kept telling me each one\nStay away from what God wanted me to do and you know and as soon as God kept telling me each one he said there's gonna be one one day that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm you're gonna marry that not only will she be beautiful on the outside but you also be beautiful on the inside\nAnd that was one finally when I gave up and stopped doing it my way\nAnd said okay God I'm done I'm thirty six years old I said that I say I'm done now done doing it my way you do it your way and as soon as I did that in fact I even took that all out of my head and as soon as that happened\nWhen we pursue God and we make him the center of our lives he gives us everything we want and more and it gives you the desires of your heart\nSo the desires of my heart was to be married\nAnd then God ports brought sue in my life and I can ask for a um a better life and so [laughter] and anybody that puts up with me
