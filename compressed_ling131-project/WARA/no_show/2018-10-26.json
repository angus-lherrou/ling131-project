A. dot com for more information\nThan once again Jim ... standing by with another update force on the forecast him\nWell dog we've got the sunshine out there this morning is going to start to see it said behind iCloud as I like to say one of the stained glass look as the afternoon wears on but a quiet day I think certainly the best day for the rest\nAs the afternoon wears on but a quiet day I think certainly the best day for the rest of the week again through the weekend with what's coming up tomorrow high today upper forties there'll be light wins out of the west are generally less than about five miles an hour and I will have ticketing clouds but if you have plans deceiving do issues\nHowever there probably will not be a boon out tonight the consequence because the clouds will be thickening\nUpper thirties and then a windswept rain tomorrow\nNow the strongest the wins will be the further you are closer to the coast but everyone is going to get a strong enough when that some leaves will be stripped off a with a\n... a sideways rain potential by the end of tomorrow over over one inch of rain that's going to cause some street flooding and again would leave coming off since a wet leaves are waiting things down some branches and even some scattered trees could come down again a lot of that having to do with yet again the soft ground\nWe've had Seventeen inches of rain in about six and a half weeks\nAcross the area at least one of my observations that I've taken Seventeen inches and across most of our weather watches around the area weather observers\nAnywhere from Fifteen to Seventeen inches of rain that's great for the reservoirs the ponds of lakes if you look around to see them running a pie and nice but uh the negative is tomorrow with the soft ground so against scattered power outages quite possible\nTomorrow's keep that in mind it'll be very isolated\nBut if you lived here a lot of trees in your neighborhood as we talk about last March when we had all those storms that was the big issue places like ... a place where there are a lot of trees and cities and towns that's where you'll likely get the power outages for example tomorrow\nI highly doubt downtown adult bar will lose power because there are very few trees I like that on Sunday mostly cloudy the better David fifties a couple of showers but certainly if you call tomorrow well real bad day Sunday is not too bad\nThat on Monday mostly cloudy still a touch of light rain in the fifties good deals as we approach Halloween\nThat on Monday mostly cloudy still a touch of light rain in the fifties good does as we approach Halloween next week which hopefully might be the last time it's on the thirty first if you have to petition moves through Tuesday starting clubs fifty nip that he's on Wednesday Halloween and we start the month of November potentially next week next Thursday\nWhen temperatures in the sixties possibly ah before some rain moves in later next week All right\nSounds good then uh well since we last time I talk to you for a for a week\nOr I you know I have fun then there's also a break and get to sleep in maybe an extra hour later on\nWhen I yeah I think I think well I think I shall that's for sure um the ah you 'cause uh I Know are you doing you're doing or tomorrow morning ride you're still going on in the actual beyond tomorrow morning as well\nAs of right now and actually the following week I probably will be on her show at some point in the studio okay uh the following week and of course that would be that the weekend when we got the clocks back then that will be talked about I'm sure\nBut uh again yeah so I'll be on again obviously with the pollen another hour or so but uh the real story is a weather wise on his rough weather along the east coast but the rest of the east coast over the coming days really looking good so\nUh once we get through tomorrow even though there's a little bit of rain on Monday a really uh for several days as we lead into the er Halloween a situation on Wednesday ah the weather looks really good so again we just get through tomorrow\nAll right I think guy and then I Would say um that week that I come back a possibly ah maybe that Thursday or we'll have you in Studio yeah\nThat'll be good yeah maybe I could with the ... most arms again like yeah yeah that'd be great staff or for the season caused by that it'll be closed getting closer to Thanksgiving so or hay and hopefully ... things up on on an otherwise terrible month of\nNovember was exactly right you got that right that's what I'm sure\nAll right well I'm a good talking to us\nExactly right you got that right I Am sure it will do a good talking to was always taught you in about ten days and you got it sat right Jim

how we feel very well very good this is Jeffrey he'd call again Jeffrey\nBoy everybody else my name I Can't get away with anything nobody knows it's amazing you know join a great job last night was very impressed with what you said\nWell thanks Jeff I appreciate that\nVery good I just wanted to give a heads up to you Mr Halley you you didn't do too bad yourself\nI just wanted to give you a complement to I didn't know I was getting black Sabbath and the end of my line here I I I could have started dancing on the on the [laughter]\nYou know I thought I'd go go man was fabulous last night on the panel and I thought I was confident\nThat don't get me started now now this is a this is ladies in the\nIn the ... now do you have a specific question for your Julie ...\nYes um we share together on a ... a for gastric or to invite me for people with disabilities and seniors Julie when you get back on to speak and he'll if you do get elected what what is your stance with people with disabilities and seniors what's the biggest thing you want to accomplish when you get up there\nYeah I ... and Jeffrey thank you for that question and welcome any time I mean there's you know the question asked yesterday but you know what don't people know about you and I can\nAnd they're sending I'll take it a little bit further to that I Do have a family member actually a few family members that have some disability and um that's one of the reasons why I Do have my son in the first place [noise] so um again not too many people know that so I understand um\nYou know the concerns and the challenges that that go on there I also understand the concerns\nAnd guess so now fast forward two years I guess what I ran out of last night at the candidates for oh you're kidding my business card Jeff you need to bring some business had rats [laughter] Julie hall is with us a former city councilor\nA retired colonel from the United States Air force my little sister just made it to lieutenant awesome yeah I'm and she has a candidate for the second Bristol district state representative seat\nUm agents sixty nine writes in and again we've argued over heavy metal music we have a lot of fans listening me so much ages six you know I said see I told you black Sabbath was great [laughter]\nThat's okay are you there now and then a serious question from agent eighty two\nUm I didn't know there was a debate last night or we talked about it a lot Sheila\nYeah eighty to you don't hang on every word I say wow anyway\nUm it was at city hall it is a ... being replayed on double ACS channels Fifteen in Ninety eight and we'll be right up until election day uh please ask Julie who she is endorsing for her old city council seat either nickel avoid tie Waterman or John Davis\n[laughter] oh boy that's a good question you know what I I think they all did a great job so I'm going to stay neutral on this because I Do think that they all did did a great job I have to go back to my original\nEndorsement that I gave and the sun chronicle which has to Palo also yeah and I thought power would have been a great candidate to run I you know he and I taught to chat a quite a bit about him running\nAnd um I told them you know what just just sit back for a little while and and\nSo intellectually curious you so involved constantly going to all kinds of different committee meetings here in the city and then he has a show here Wednesday nights several to not have any young man yes we were ... in the future or even though he played college football for one of the worst teams and all the way England and\n[noise] All right Julie I'm so sorry we don't have time to go and play lots of black Sabbath music 'cause\nWe got lots of questions for you Julie hall I'm\nA candidate for a second Bristol district state representative age and Eighteen wants to know what was the result of the last election with Jim Hawkins and Julie I Believe it was fifty two percent forty eight percent in favor of Jim ... and then um do you think that is because she has an R next to her name\nLike Trump or is I Would say like ... [laughter]\nAnd let me just add quickly 'cause I've told when you've been on before on the national level\nUm I always I I it will to might take me a thousand years to have a vote for Republican again in the national level on the local level addressing the last question eighty six percent of the Democratic party control the legislature is the problem I Want more balanced Sheila so locally if a Republican gives me a chance to vote for them I'll vote for them\nEven I Am so angry about some of the stuff Republicans have done on the national level I'm going to have a little more trouble this year and and I know that you like Charlie Baker already reasonable Republican if you look up decent hardworking public servant there might be a picture of Julie Hi\nI'm ... how concerned are you with the direction of the Republican\nThe whole um things how concerned are you with the direction of the Republican Party is a federal level and how does that affect your chance was here for someone who is such a reasonable hardworking full of integrity Republican\nYeah I appreciate that and I think that um you know were\nThings that happen at the federal level they do affect you know they do trickle down but but most of the focus here is in Massachusetts\nAnd I think the good thing that's going on is I haven't endorsed by the governor governor Baker and governor Baker is the most popular governor in the United states and I think that's what's helpful we've already had discussions governor Baker an eye about different things that I Would like to see an outer borough already so I think that's a great thing\nThis I don't agree with everything the governor does sometimes sometimes I think he does a little bit take things a little bit step further than I necessarily would\nBut I think the the one thing I can solidly say is I Am a fiscal conservative so I mean who isn't though in these in this day and age so you know so when you talk about you know what's the difference between a Republican and Democrat\nReally you're talking socially too and I tend to be very moderate on social issues and I think that's why people sort of you know see me as again\nDon't put me in a box and it's very hard to put me in a box and I think when people put labels on you they that they they try to think there are certain things and\nI Try very hard to let people don't really know who I Am and and what I and what I feel because I think they would be awful surprised sometimes some of the decisions that in which way I go if they give me a chance\nWhich I'm going to push back just a little bit ah who isn't a fiscal conservative I Would say the president and the Republicans would pass this ridiculous ... eighty three percent of the benefit went to the wealthiest people in this country and it was made our debt explode but that's a national issue we want to stick a local issue\nNow you're right because I Know that Governor Baker in particular and something I'm a real big\nWhich do we want us to a local issue you know you're\nRight because I Know that Governor Baker in particular and something I'm a real big fan of the earned income tax credit I don't know if you wear that but I'm a huge fan of this thing is I read more and more about this the earned income tax credit helps to blow lower or the most needy people\nAnd and doing work on the earned income tax credit to allow people to to work\nIs a wonderful thing so I think focusing and and I know the governor is not a huge fan of of the ... or an income tax so we have down in line and I think that's good things that is a good place to be for everybody in my opinion we're\nTalking to candidate for state rep Julie hall in the second Bristol district our next guest who I Know you're interested in hearing Harvey Schwartz is waiting on hold will soccer Harvey at ten thirty or which I Can't wait to ah to speak to him it fascinated gentleman but\nIn our last ah six minutes a lightning round what are some of the issues and excuse me will correspondence and want to bypass this but I Know\nAll the way along so you know for me to run in in ... in April was like I said just sort of I don't want to say bumped on the road but you know an extra push that I had to go through but I always had my attention I was going to run in November no matter what\nThe the good thing was it was so close I didn't even have to think\nI you know the important part of your party and this is you guys were talking about how important party is your party has just bought your your say it's okay for you to run you can't you can't just run but if they if you're not their candidate it's going to be very very difficult\nSo that night I looked at my party and I said would you want me to run again to you and they were just so overjoyed they said absolutely we want you to run again\nSo I never ever had an intention not to do so\nI have had challenges in my life before and I've always said don't get it down not going to be I Am not\nLife before and I've always said don't get it down not going to be I Am not a person that's going to be taken down I'm going to get right back up again and go so\nI think that's very important but some of the things that I'd like to see happen what things in particular if people tell me from three B. they're angry they can't vote for me and I have a lot of friends there so one of the things I Would like to do is you know in the in the spirit of unification\nI Would like to unite three be into outer borough and to and to try to see if I can get out of our district so that we can have the entire city of adult barrel under one representative\nThat could get us into the topic of gerrymandering but this isn't a twenty seven hour shows we wouldn't be able to cover all about um\n[noise] but you know I don't know how difficult that will be but that's something I'd like to sort of look at it and again you're right you have to look at population and things of those things but I definitely want to pursue that\nI as I stated last night I'm very interested in it as senior tax freeze\nI Know this tax relief that goes through is lots of tax relief but I Want to see a senior tax free in some states they have income levels on it and some states they have just age I Would just I'd like to see it just age OK tax rate I think that people no matter what their income level and then what the circumstances when they return to a certain point in their life\nThey deserve to know that they're not they deserve to know what their finances are going to be for the rest of their lives and they deserve to not have you know sort of a a wrench thrown into their system and cause some some difficulties that's just not fair they leave they've lived their life they've done great things for us what we have today is because of them\nThere's a new remote corresponded from age and forty seven and will make this quick um will Jim Hawkins and Julie hall have a real race a road race besides their political race cars you both runners\n[laughter] I think Jim Jim is a triathlon I think so that's you know give them a lot of respect for that probably\nI think Jim Jim is a triathlon I think so that's you know give them a lot of respect for that probably I said\nTo the gym I said the trust a marathoner said trust bicycle people I trust swimmers I'm not sure if I ... yeah that's an awful lot of time to spend on just yourself yes yes but there's water that caught question right back to\nThe gym I can tell you you know I Do run 'em every other day I Do run I run a five K. or every other day and I've kind of made that my thing\nUm I enjoy doing that the good thing about when I run is if there is a particular thing and I used to do this right before especially for city council if there was a particular issues that I was thinking of by the time I finished that run I knew exactly what I was going to do I molded over my head\nYou know I'd already had done some research and but and it's just a way to clear your head so um I don't think that will be running 'cause I Will not be\nWell I shouldn't say never say never write it over\nThere that are we only have a couple of minutes left for Julie ... all one thing or you know about Julie of all politicians who've ever handed out a campaign pens\nYou've got the best you can do quality quality but in a more serious nature and the last couple of minutes you know one two three right off the top ah what did you what is Julie hall we plan to do for the constituents of garbage truck in Brazil district if you prevail under members\nSo definitely I'm going to pursue the tax the senior tax rates number one definitely I Want to um\nLook at well permitting process you know somebody had brought that up in the paper the permitting process and the small businesses have come to me and said that especially people that mobile mobile um businesses that they have to be permitted and every one of the cities and towns I think that's that's crazy\nI mean these people are small business they have to pay permit these things like that so I'd love to be able to change that that's one of the other things I mean I Do want to try to look at the redistricting that's for sure but for the most part I Will be out here like I I normally am I have a lot of groups and organizations that I Am in touch with I'm going to ...\nOut here like I I normally am I have a lot of groups and organizations that I Am in touch with I'm going to continue to remain with them or those organizations because I like them and\nThere there is a great way of finding out what people really need and I think that's important for me to keep that networking going to keep that you know pulse out there with the rest of algebra I expect to be just people see me at the same places they normalcy me I I'm here I'm In this community I'm part of this community and want to stay part of this community\nAnd how can people get in contact with you and or your campaign if they have questions comments\nSure well there's a couple of different ways so I have an email which is um [noise] let's see Julie hall dot us at ... dot com so Julie hall one word dot us at ... dot com which is really the best way to get in touch with me but also give a telephone number so that's five eight\nFour or five five five eight one three\nKnow he doesn't and that's that's the scariest part of it and this is what\nHe doesn't know he doesn't and that's that's the scariest part of it\nAnd this is what led me to write the novel that I wrote um I tried to come up with a plausible scenario applying president laws in which something like the Holocaust can happen in the United states and and I just took it step by step by step\nA lot of it was substituting or Jews for Muslims and and and taking her\nViews and criticisms of Muslims and coming up with a scenario where it was acceptable to apply that to juice wow and and just played out the scenario in the book or it was pretty frightening\nYeah well a couple of things one I'm good news for the Muslim should NATO Conor just announced last night that she she is joining the religion of Islam\nOr but on it but I don't want serious note this current administration has been so concerned they tell us about religious freedom and the truth is they're concerned about religious freedom for conservative Christians not so much everyone else\nRight right I mean it's it's it's the most worth you know but it's the bus were that seems to buzz pretty loudly with some people you know what what what are the things that got me started on\nThis um [noise] besides with representing the neo Nazis I represented a couple of Saudi detainees at Guantanamo\nAnd I went down to see them and a visiting Guantanamo in\nCuba was a pretty shocking experience for me I'm interviewing my class all they were chained to a ring on the floor\nYeah I'm an coming back I visited my father\nWho had been a prisoner of war he was captured like two weeks after landing on Omaha Beach\nWow and I was telling him about what\nRoundup Jewish Americans wow\nSo I'm not jamming that are in that actually fits within the subject of the book\nRight right now is not exactly I mean I'm I'm I'm a lawyer I I use these laws um I litigated up to the Supreme Court ah with some of these laws and uh you know take out take out the word Muslim put him in order to ... and uh it's it's terrifying\nIt's funny in any conflict or any a war situation\nUm it is a people\nOn both sides in sometimes it's really hard for one person to commit violence against another person unless you were able to demonize the enemy\nAnd make them become then we weren't fighting the Japanese were fighting the names we weren't biting the Germans were fighting the crowds and the ... or demonizing entire groups of people\nIs one\nScary horrible and wrong and to really really effective\nIt's some something that struck me recently [noise] um I was looking at some of the rationale behind a I'm a immigration restrictions because or ISIS is going to sneak in terrorists\nYou know a ... on with all the refugees\nThat's why we can't take in refugees and I was doing some research on an event that happened in Nineteen thirty nine when a shift loaded with a Jewish German refugees yep\nCame to Florida and uh we wouldn't we wouldn't let them off the ship right and it was President Roosevelt I found a speech by President Roosevelt saying that there might be German spies among the refugees and that's why we can't left them in and it's like [noise]\nIt's among the refugees and that's why we can't let them in and it's like it's the same record than playing over and over and over again and yes it's terrifying\nAnd almost every single one of those Jewish people on that ship that was turned away or did not did not survive World War two we're ... we're talking to Harvey a Schwartz S. C. H. O. W. A. R. T. Z. his novel is never again from ah\nAh who's the publisher that Virginia Beach came Charles\nYeah coal ... which are publishing\nOkay and then age in forty eight a writes in and again we um we give our we call our textures Harvey remote correspondence 'cause it sounds more impressive than texture and we and we give them aged numbers because we're all huge fans of the show get smart\nAnd I aged forty eight and myself we agree on lots of stuff not so much on a lot of political issues but he writes in this man is very interesting just fascinating to hear stories\nNo questions for him but is his book on Amazon and how do you spell the last name which is why I just felt uh S. C. H. W. A. R. T. Z. where do people get your book never again\nOkay the official launched it through the book is\nNovember twenty four and a quarter to my\nPublisher it'll be available everywhere if it's already on Amazon for pre orders\nOkay well how do we know that Harvey Schwartz can right I mean have you ever written anything else in your life aside legal briefs\nArgue your spirit reporter [laughter] oh so you used to dealing with oh I don't know editors in fact checkers\nOh yeah [laughter] I I I started off in\nNewspapers with a manual typewriter and after she carbon paper\nOh gosh carbon paper a ... and it's funny in the newspaper industry you guys used to look at fact checkers the way I worked in the insurance industry for a million years that's the way we looked at underwriters\nThere's the way I worked in the insurance industry for a million years that's the way we looked at under writers are so much trying to make a sale on insurance sale for crying out loud in any underwriters comes in and says you can't do it that way which is how editors work with journalists in some cases\nWell but it's ah [noise] I think I think journalism is a great background for anybody\n... exactly right All right five a way to to to you know before we get to this break I got to take a commercial break very very quickly you know there's a lot a lot of talk about a left wing media bias and I think there is a bias in the media but I think it's an intelligent media bias is really really tough\nTo become a top level journalist and respect for truth and respect for cooperating witnesses is a huge part of that one of the reasons it's so tough to become a journalist is that you can't just make stuff up and promote the news and become a successful journalist is that accurate\nWell that's probably one of the biggest changes in society and the last three years that are on the Internet remember when the Internet first started there was a cartoon that went around and dark sitting in front of a keyboard saying on the Internet nobody knows or a dog yeah ad and\nUm it wasn't easy getting a job as a newspaper reporter and it wasn't easy keeping the job and and and\nIf you screwed up yet if you made mistakes you lost your job yeah but these days anybody can declare themselves or you know inter galactic service and write whatever they want and nobody knows what's on the other side of a of the screen\nAnd and I know somebody who's got neutral couldn't this wouldn't be supported by either party\nOh ... ... ... what Reagan as of right wing it off now for the current Republican Party but anyway\nI'm Harvey a Schwartz is the name you can go to Harvey a Schwartz dot com that Schwartz with a C. S. C. H. W. A. R. T. V.

Bush now\nOn the great philosopher George W. Bush now\nShe was there there is All right ... thank you so much for joining us on pontificated with Paul and the ...

Jean Val is anti Dan re WB Z all liberals and don't forget democracy now get democracy and I was on one station\nYou're calling Dan York and Dan re\nLiberals Jean Val assigned to I don't know enough about your calling them liberals are you kidding me all in the year two thousand Eighteen through the perspective of how we car fan with Dan York or Dan re be considered liberal\nWow they're borderline borderline moderates\nYeah I I haven't I haven't heard in New York in a few years I Know we are losing Rhode Island is still on WPRI oh and I didn't find them necessarily it'd be a liberal out ah [noise] I don't know enough about Dan re although the ... or Jean Val sent the Jean Val Sunday for years that they're not you know and you are but I haven't heard that shows all that much\nFor centimeters four centimeters to the right of Attila the Hun doesn't make you a liberal\nWow wow I'm\nFive oh wait two to one three to zero the number five a way to to to Thirteen twenty I tried to do the best part of the show during a commercial break Kevin Callahan was wondering can we ever have a third party why did you why did you recommend that\nI mean uh it's everyone's either Republican or Democrat you brought up you know it used to be conservative you know liberal or you know are Democrats you know whenever there was more movement within the within the system and now there's no movements either one or the other and back in the nineties you know\nSo I mean and now there's no movements either one or the other and back in the nineties you know there was a I thought a huge push for a third party\nOr you know you had Jesse Ventura in Minnesota\nOr you had a the Maine governor was an independent as well for a while\nAnd ah in Rhode Island where I was living at the time they had a the cool moose party all yeah they came out and endorsed thirty five moose had beer moose heavy hitters exactly and I think the only that hurt him was a that gentleman's looks he's a lawyer\nBut he had those easy top beard go and uh but if you listen to them in a debate he was really good and it really seemed like there was a real good push for a third party\nAnd I think you know now's the time like I Can't believe that people feel so\nMuch one way or the other that there's just not enough middle ground and I think now's the time for a you know a good third party you know I mentioned this to you before you well you know it's you know\nEveryone is your third quarter of the Mansfield game during a commercial break\n[laughter] exactly to the ... you know it you know everyone you know railing against Trump but you know I think I said the ... before too is All right now who's going to run against them instead of railing against them need somebody to step up either Republican or Democrat to run against him because it's all\nAnti anti Trump and that's fine except he's not going anywhere for at least two more years 'cause it's it's it's ... impeachments won't work that he'll be in office through his four ... four year term and if somebody doesn't step up now somebody has to run against them instead of just keep killing while he can't come back he can't come back you can't come back\nWho's running against them and then again it will take awhile for that third party to ah to get going again\nI have a big fear that only a white male can beat him only white marriage you say that a earlier this week and ... far more important to me oh Michael ... who by the way I've had about enough of him my God because one thing\nOf an oddity who by the way I've had enough of him [laughter] oh my God because one thing he has in common with Donald Trump Michael ...\nTrump we all know it's all about Trump and Michael ... stormy Daniels' lawyer trust me folks trust me do put him in any pedestal [laughter] 'cause it's all about Michael ... as far as he's concerned but he got in the way wicked a big amount of trouble for saying that\nAh it's going to take a white male to be Trump and I uh I don't think that's a good thing I think that's a horrible thing but I think that's the correct thing massage and he still incredibly strong racism has never been greater\nUm and there it is and then agents six\nUm he the age of sixty nine believes that this whole um hopes for fake bomb thing was put together by Democrat elites to make Republicans look bad and it's going to backfire on an agent six writes in\nI agree with the age of sixty nine he actually didn't write that age and sixty nine of just adding it for comic effect it's becoming clear that Liz Warren was obviously behind the pipe bomb mailings as she's the only one on the left who didn't get one [laughter]\nI don't think she's the only one [laughter] a prominent one [laughter] and then I got to make sure I don't lose my\nOkay\nI did a a home I got a ... yes mark we will do our best to give you updates on not only the Boston Red Sox but yes yes the uh all of the local football games tonight north out

what I tried to do too it's like okay I just got more facts on the situation or oh I didn't know that oh that's interesting that he supports my view I'm like okay that's not enough to sway me I get it but uh\nI I I could see where you're coming from I Do try to have both sides\nAre then determine that you're wrong before you know yeah I'm right\nUm I think this is a tongue in cheek joke so I'll read it this way\nAnd I think this has meant in in good spirits not as an insulting way which is why I'm reading it this Justin dawn limit of CNN arrested in bomb hoaxes [laughter]\nAll right that's

on the air\nI I Can't bring it up if you want it's one thing that I saw was a pretty interesting you brought up and that is a you mentioned how people flip flop in uh in politics and then I I thought it was interesting 'cause this question kind of came up as the save up to be and that was you know how foreign our party politics and I think\nSome of the criticisms that people receive when they flip flop is because of this you know maybe like for example if a you know the politicians a Democrat or Republican and they go against their party on a specific issue and you know the realistic pessimistic and me is probably say well once they flip flop is like the party told them\nListen we need we want you on this issue and obviously they don't lose the support so they ended up following their party lines\nYou and obviously they don't want to lose the support so they ended up following their party lines you know what I mean so I\nThink that's kind of I Can't say that answers all of them but I think that might be one example of\nWhy oftentimes receive a politician flip flop on a specific issue\n... I I get upset when I hear you voted this way twenty five years ago\nYeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nI was a much different person when I was twenty three that when I'm forty eight ... different life events have happened the shape who I Am now and yeah I my ... I Hope I ... a little bit differently\nNow with the forty eight year old that I did as a twenty three year old and that that bothers me you know when you hear that you hear that a lot but but you voted this way Fifteen Years ago oh okay new facts of emerging\nI gave one is one exception to that because I agree with you a hundred percent with one exception if you voted to support the invasion of Iraq in two thousand and one or two thousand two whenever the vote was that I'm Still holding against you\nGo okay and then there was um [noise] there was one time when I went\nWhen I was an interesting state houses took a trip to the uh Edward Kennedy center as he's like the Senate replica all of them from Boston yeah and they do reenactment so are your votes and whatnot and it did one on the civil rights and there was I Believe it was one senator says voted against it and it was the only ...

[laughter]\nExactly you know ... that's just getting the facts and I changed my mind and that happened this and that happened\nUm they've been Kennedy at one point that were opposed gay marriage or what NASA afterwards when they realized they may lose an election\nI mean I I I think sometimes that that gets them to change that\nWe moved in election [laughter] I think sometimes that that gets them to change their suing buff\nAnd how polite iffy Apollo to not mentioned Barack Obama by name was ... that that that's just what he did [laughter] [laughter]\nBut that's a that's a perfect example though you know if that are gay marriage goes up in the fifties or sixties you know Ninety percent of the people are voting one way you know there are against it but now facts and other things come out now science backing it up and now now it's passing\nFor the biggest thing to come out when they came out of the closet and we've got to know more gay people\nActually do it you are armed with the facts were like oh okay that's not the worst thing in the world but I haven't had enough they can get divorced it's like that or a sexual people now [laughter] the cultural\nShift to the society changing and honestly just accepting you know different views and you know I think it's that that's part of it to just society just thinking this is a glass or\nActually hey there it is we got to get to a break and I got another call coming in Palo thank you so much for calling great contribution\nThank you and not great job yesterday a panelist on both of those did they Oh thank you follow up on\nAll right there he goes and again Paolo if you were listening earlier we had Julie hall on and ... um\nBecame one of the first politician ever or to get a um\n[noise] [noise] [noise] what do you call it when someone supports another politician the endorsement thank you [noise] 'cause I'm here today\nReceived an endorsement\nFor the outer boroughs city council from Julie hall even though he's not running now what Paul polo could just get endorsements for races he is running and he'd already be on the city council or who knows maybe even better about overall but Palo it's a great start their first endorsement matters even though you weren't involved in\nAnd over until I can hit Eighteen so jacking up a Twenty one\nExcellent folks that's going to wrap it up Amy Goodman coming up next for democracy now e quality time tonight at five o'clock with Laurie Sawyer and I hope for co hosts name is Celeste I really do high school football\nWill be on the air in about six fifty Kevin and I as the Arab world fighting bluebird years taking on fighting Catholic memorial fighting nights [noise]\nExpect a big fight if you get if you like the show folks please tell some of the bottom we could use them Louis city if not have the decency to keep their mouth shot\nDouble you are a Thirteen twenty\nAm Arab world I every one I'm Jim carbon changes in the weather we've got sun and high clouds mid clouds the rest of today a high of about forty six colorful sunset quite possible so\nGet off your phone don't stare at the phone stare at the western sky you might have a nice thrill of a sunset falling back to forty tonight\nRainstorm coastal stormed with strong east north east wins tomorrow twenty to forty a few guards to forty five that could take down certainly strip leaves off trees and also branches and even a few trees power outages a possible there'll be isolated but there'll be a few around I Would expect as wins increase\nAnd again the wind Ruben rain rain lighter tomorrow night and then as we go into Sunday certainly the better day of the weekend mostly cloudy milder well into the fifties just a chance of a shower\nSome light rain a weaker system on Monday good news though still looks dry uncomfortable for Halloween I'm Jim Corbin but W.

that how it was about Fifteen twenty two fighter jets we'll talk about what's happened to them stay with us\nYou\nKnow and a guy\nWho are you I\nEnjoy\nYour ...\nYour your\nYour your your\nYour your\n\nMm\nMm\nHundred by them you know this is democracy now I'm Amy Goodman on Thursday vice president Mike Pence traveled to the ... air force base in the Florida Panhandle just over a week after the base was largely destroyed during hurricane Michael\nThe bases the home of a fleet of fifty five after twenty two stealth fighters before hurricane Michael level the base at least thirty three of these jets were flown to safety to Ohio\nBut at least Seventeen of the planes costing and found a third of a billion dollars each three hundred and thirty nine million dollars each we're likely left behind and possibly destroyed because they weren't era worthy at the time\nThere are several airbases located right on the coast and storm prone areas in states in the south where scientists anticipate climate change induced hurricanes will grow more intense and more frequent but on Thursday\nVice president Pence vowed to rebuild the entire base to talk more about this issue we're joined by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Dave Philips national correspondent for the New York times one of his recent piece is headlined exposed by Michael climate threat to warplanes at coastal basis\nDave welcome back to democracy now she joined us from Colorado can you talk about what you understand\nHappened at Kendall\nSure well as we know hurricane Michael when it develop developing very fast hadn't gotten much bigger than a than was predicted and I think that really caught the air force off guard\nSo for decades what the air force is done and also the navy and and the army and Marines who all have their their own\nOh what they've done when one of their their air force\nTheir own aircraft uh\nWhat they've done one of their their airfields is in harm's way is a fire up the planes and fly them off to safety in this case at pinball they flew um most of their after twenty two\nTo an air force base in Ohio a and that works if you can get your plane started but the EPA plenty sue is a very sophisticated and somewhat finicky plane and a quarter\nAn Airforce reports only about half of them are missing ready at any one time and so with only a couple of days' notice of this impending storm\nOr they weren't able to get you know set of wear hearing Seventeen planes I'm going and so they they put them in hangers on the base and and they\nUh they hope for the best and the best did not happen or when hurricane Michael hit the coast did hit directly on ten till Airforce base\nAnd the wind there were measured up to one hundred thirty miles an hour before the bases a wind speed measuring appointment broke so we really don't know how ferocious storm really was but\nAfterwards the base was flattened or many of its hangers had uh their rooms ripped off a buildings were flooded uh I I think the Airforce or you know in its assessing the saying that base it's almost a complete loss and these planes that were left behind\nThe air force as being very careful about what it says about it but the but they say that that many of them are damaged\nMany envy is believed to be what seven chain ...\nWhich is worse ... somewhere around five point eight billion dollars depending on how you account at a compare that to the replacing the entire base which would only cost about a one point five billion by the Air Force's estimation so these these ...\nA one point five billion by the Air Force's estimation so these these planes are are literally irreplaceable and also just add a tremendous cost\nI mean you think about this President Trump has been talking about a caravan of immigrants coming up uh from Honduras making its way through Mexico talking about it as a threat to national security\nIf people learned that there was an air force base and the southern border that was almost leveled that perhaps Seventeen of vets leading on a jet fighter planes destroyed um if people would say who did that more who is the enemy\nSo let's talk about that and then you build this how to withstand climate change at\nThe increasing intensity and ferocity and the storms scientists said and then overwhelmingly that and this is being fueled by human activity your thoughts on that [noise] well um\nI I Believe in the Bible also believe in science and um\nWe'll also believe in science and um\nAs as a I don't know what all causes these storms to be so frequent now and so ferocious but I did rig Albert ... book twenty twenty five years ago and it made sense\nNear from Tennessee though that says your beach house here Tennessee a course a land of Al Gore among others and he's been a profit on the issue of climate change for a long time\nHere in Florida where the governor denies climate change you're in a land where the president denied climate change what you say to them I'm\nAbout to say look around and look at the science and sometimes people say things politically to be expedient but\nIf if there's a one percent chance that human activity has contributed to this but when you look at it closely and\nIf there are scientists if there is other data out there\nDon't know except I see people down here hurting terribly people lost their homes people lost everything whatever the calls for the human activity or not\nTo be all down here you're going to do more of this and I'm going to have to do more\nTo survive the next one but I Would hope that the politicians would do more to try to deal with with what's going on I think it's a if we can put a man on the moon\nWe can solve this issue of carbon we can do that if we have the willpower\nPeople need to quit the nine ...\nWhy do you think it has happened I mean just down the road I talked to a a woman who is an owner of another house it did pretty well and she talked about building the new standards and that's why she thinks that happened but when I asked her about climate change that I'm not going there why is this such a politically charged issue why isn't it it's just that science\nMy opinion of that and it may be wrong they're confusing the message and the messenger\nMy opinion of that and I may be wrong they're confusing the message of the messenger so because of the fact particularly because Gore jumped on that issue than everybody else that like they had to be against it they they can't be for it it's just like you had a lot of people against Medicare Medicare started\nAnd now if you say anything bad about Medicare is political death\nThe same thing should be true in my opinion about science now my\nNephew built built the house where they were partners in it and\nHe has doubts about it he's a doctor\nHas doubts about you know to the extent\nHuman activity has contributed and I don't know maybe maybe maybe it is a Chinese folks but\nWhat I'm looking at around here is not a Chinese hopes those are real people who are suffering terribly and why someone would would have the attitude is I'm not going to even consider it a lot when even consider the possibility of human activity\nI you know but if you start talking about coal than an election you lose West Virginia and Kentucky and parts of Tennessee but\nBut Cole is terrible\nCold is not good coat it's tough on the miners is one of the worst jobs in the world you know have where the where the survival rate I mean look look at their life expectancy\nAnd those coal mines we can get other jobs for those people that can be building solar panels there's other things I can do we just have to adjust economies are price to be paid for it it was a price to pay for putting a man on the moon\nBut we wanted to do it and and we can solve this and it shouldn't be a Republican or democratic issue it should be a papal issue and a planet issue that's just incredible that\nThe greatest country in the world we think of ourselves the greatest country in rural that we would fail to be leading on this issue and and there are some bright later ... ... just because some politicians like political hay out of out of denying climate change and laughing about it\nIn ... like political hay out of out of denying climate change and laughing about it um doesn't mean that that the rest of us can do something we told them in the beginning\nI Want to concrete house that that will survive a hurricane there with my ... my roof they're one of the things that I can show you in the house that that we did less less glass more concrete\nAnd even according to the new standards they said thirty ... pilings you went in for forty nine o'clock at the meaning of that now um\nIt was just a slight difference\nCouple of thousand dollars it seems like to go a little bit deeper on the pilings for that many different ... I don't know thirty may have been just fan\nSo explain the first floor\nIs not a house sits in the water congestion we talk\nOur cars Raj and there was a storage room back there and best Georgia was gone now it's just wiped clean like he was never there\n'cause the ocean just went through the first floor took it took it out\nAnd the building behind you there where the where the workmen are um\nWas on that second floor Eighteen Inches they told me\nEighteen Inches in that second floor [noise]\nAnd we don't have any signs of water in on the ground floor to see where it was because they said it came in clean and in\nFront of you get in on the more the more you see the\nMarks on the walls\nSo we don't know ... you know where we work so we know we lost around floor and and it was probably right up\nTo the to the ceiling down there\nAnd of course there the water just came in and then it receded and you had nothing there to\nGo in and took out other people to\nMy debris can cause trouble downstream\nSo that's why we're looking at right now is how do we do things where\nWe have the minimum amount of damage and we don't damage of the people\nA damaged and we don't damage to the people\nYou want to show me what you have inside the only thing that I can think of\nThat I didn't follow the engineers advice on\nSo we are a little camera up there the wash the host on Monday I couldn't watch it\nBut if you kept calling me like if I get up owning a\nBecause you were to upset I couldn't just go on me\nBecause I'm going to\nWatch the fear go out\nTo watch all the water command watch just turn into the ocean\nTotal devastation [noise]\nProbably everything you see\nBeen torn down this is the road to the theater and the recount houses on both sides of the road all built on soy ebb and they're all destroyed [noise]\nNot show of all or most of them they're all destroyed\nAnd that's true everywhere on both sides of highway not hear the lady you mentioned that\nYou talked to heard don't go there you know or don't go there do here\nLook if I was do you think people should build so close to the ocean\nThat's Russell King he owned and built the fan palace and Mexico beach in the panhandle\nOf Florida it's one is the only houses to remain intact on the beach in Mexico beach built to withstand a nearly category five storm\nWrestle king comes from Chattanooga, Tennessee and attorney assistant of course you know when we come back elite universities in the United states being questioned about their ties to Saudi Arabia and its funding stay with us\n\nDo to me but he\n... he is the\nNew ... the ...\nKnow the movie and then we were lucky the two of those you know a little hard oh ... ... ... ... ... the\nAlgae nice traditional Yemeni songs that his democracy now I mean he good men if Turkish president ... urges Saudi Arabia to discuss who ordered the murder of Saudi journalist\n... we end today show looking at how us universities are facing scrutiny over their close ties to Saudi Arabia and the wake of ... murder\nEarlier this year crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited both Harvard and MIT on his first official tour to the U.S ahead of the meeting and I teach students presented their universities precedent Rafael race with a stack of petitions protesting and ... that's\nFor us to reconsider meeting on the phone [noise] you know you're where that has been\nAble to do except the resources for somebody sort of like sort of work that way about it though is that there was seven being caused by his oldest son\nWho is a gift when she was she wanted to human rights\nBoth Harvard provost Alan Garber and the MIT precedent Rafael race ...\nProvost Alan Garber and the MIT precedent roughly a reef met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman Saudi officials later publicized meeting some social media to move critics say would choose to give the crown prince legitimacy\nMeanwhile Yale University law school ... esque ...

Friday at five o'clock and want to thank you so much for listening to us\n[noise] so I um we have some things to talk about that so much things happened over this past week that are we're kind of disturbing but let's talk about a couple of really good things that happened over the week may not have been part of our country's things that happened but\nThere is a country or in the world that's passing a groundbreaking law protecting the rights of transgender people in their country\nAnd they have a couple of different proposals that they're working on a one of the ... the proposal has treatment options for trans people that's considered a right they will um\nTake care of all of their treatments from hormones and surgery and and everything else it sets inside also sets aside one percent of government jobs for ... the current trends community ensuring that they have employment\nAnd and also try tries to make amends for the treatment of trans people and the um the past when they had 'em and dictatorships\n... and that's I'm not even not even in this hemisphere down in South America and Europe way [noise] and um I actually don't have your microphone up now but he wanted\nTo say your name hydraulics does she really cool that's like a school thing that you can do for the country but a country that you should be hearing a century that you know also I've noticed about wild that um\n[noise] you know considered conservatism so folks they just don't agree with transferred to business will consider Iran's\nLooking on the PTA here and it said before the Islamic Revolution in Nineteen Seventy nine issues trance identity in Iran had never been officially trip but beginning in the mid eighties\nParents identity in Iran had never been officially addressed but beginning in the mid eighties transgender individuals were officially recognized by the government allowed to undergo sex reassignment surgery SRS or ... or ... whatever you fancy\nYou know when I'm Talking about but when we were I'm Talking I realized that I'm Serious I Do live in ... inches in Rhode Island which you know still is going to affect you guys because I'm sure you come to Massachusetts all the time I mean you did today [laughter] and\nI'm thirty two other times it's still gonna affect you um when you come in to public accommodations in the state that doesn't matter if you live here I mean unfortunately will be able to vote on it because you don't live here but you know it's definitely something that's still going to affect you\nRight we're very close to the state line and we do a lot of shopping right over the line very many people do\nIt right Walmart is I'm frightened route one has got hung up on it and we live right near there so\nWalmart is um you know in Brighton route one has got hung up on it and we live right near there so we know how um there's so much business is there and that's where the public accommodations are as all the businesses all the places that you can go parks everything that's um\nAnything that some of it is where people congregate in the public accommodation and you know I'm going to mention it and I'm sure we'll talk more about it but it's not just the bathroom bill right and you know the people who are against it um are\nThey just talk about the bathroom and they think that it's because people\nUm men are going to dress up in women's clothing to go just so they can go in the women's bathroom and assault people and so is that you know women and children are not going to be safe but that's what they're trying to you know get the fear of\nOf people will say no it's the ... yeah and a multiple of people in the past I've talked about how much that does not make sense pedophiles take awhile to earn the trust of a child um and\nI don't know how many men would just\nGo first of all they have to go to a store to buy one that's close mhm right mhm if you are willing to go in a public spot with women's clothes maybe your trans [laughter] consider that and there's nothing wrong with that\nYou know this isn't a mystery you know is that this is a spectrum this a lot of gender I'm\nA word expression who you love and what kind of biology\nDo you have and all that is not binary it is variable\nAll that is not buying airy it is variable and I've known plenty of women who are feminine and on the outside that rather mouse on the other side and vice versa mhm you know guys too mhm and anyone in between and you just you never know\nWe're not threatening which people you know and this has been going on for thousands of years mhm the storage units in the Bible be Jesus talks the bottom\nGlory it is no I'm blessed that is the unit for they were created by God by men or by themselves\nThey were transgender people they were ... people born male there were castrated and put among the women to protect them but also they were transferred to\nYou know I read a couple of books on this matter and uh by priests by a rabbis\nTalking about this issue um this is nothing new and and anyone who's a gay bisexual pan social not anything new going on for a long long time\nYeah I went to actually um mention um some of the things that\nTrump has been talking about this week and there was some sort of a a memo or something that came out from the um health and Human Services department that they're trying to redefine the word gender\nI'm and basically say that there's only two male and female nothing else and I\nI was actually thinking about this and wondering what happens to those people who really are just mentioned the UNIX I was not really talking about that but like those that are interest acts that have both genders what are they going to know what are they gonna do actually is\nSex that have both genders what are they going to know what are they gonna do actually it's both sexes excuse me\nYeah so um see I'm not all understanding of it I [laughter] thank you for correcting that's why we're good friends [laughter] but anyways how are they going to\nProve that they are one or the other [laughter] you know it's like this biology once again I'm not every person can have a heart inside their body not every person can have two arms to legs\nAnd a bum sometimes things happen in the womb this includes intersects formerly known as hermaphrodite switches veteran brother was dedicated and no longer used it is somewhat derogatory at this\nStage to imagine\nImagine judging little Suzie a little Timmy for Chris something ... blaming them for having a ... you're going to judge them this is an Old Testament people this isn't a\nOld school Israel or or Iraq or\nYou know Yemen this is the United states of America [noise] yeah I Know it's just ... the\nUm the other countries that are more um accepting you know that we were talking about before I I Can't even believe how more advanced they are\nShocking is it really shocking because it's the places that had an America that time has died like poverty and all that but they're all the time they're accepting people who are ... but we're not accepting and we have a better country then\nHow was that even like calculate how is that even\n... trying to figure out how is that even\nWhat our world is people places where there's poverty diseases illnesses are killing everyone but they're setting people and like how was your dollar amounts are so much different than I'm supposed to be the the land of the free\nYeah yeah you free and the brave how we free and brave of where\nThe um yet discriminate against other people trying to reach people yes that was um definitely um what I wanted to talk about your right Toby is that what the the memo is trying to do is to a race people a race for transgender people\n[noise] so uh [laughter] [noise] oh [laughter] you know we have more visitors here oh um I think this is Alex ... [laughter] oh\nToby daughter everyone [laughter] get us about\nAbsolutely\nI I'm I Wonder how I mean if that's really passes what's going on I Would hope not you know and that's even why it's more important for um laws like this public a combination a lot to pass you know yes on three because then\nI don't know yeah it's the federal government that is doing things like this but if we have in Massachusetts a stable and accepting and you know\nTaught on I don't want to be tolerant enough word but you know a state that accepts everybody and allows them to go to public accommodations just like they should be at like anyone else then at least we have ... people have their vote yes for this kind of thing\nA ... people have to vote yes for this kind of thing yeah I'm no one ever said that the Trump Administration actually made sense [laughter]\nRight right I've actually been cautiously asking questions amongst people that I Know in and out of work there I\n... and\nWe laugh at the lack of reason and all this because what you can read what your race people ... what are we number are you a number two pound foolish like that you did not have superpowers you do not have the right to judge\nNow you know\nI mean what are you what do you think you know I think quite and I [laughter] I Know that you're tired and I know I really appreciate your coming but I'm\nNodding doesn't really go over well on radio [laughter] I hear you there and not a [laughter] I don't have ... [laughter]\nYeah [noise]\nI don't know what we're talking [laughter] he said that you were going to do that but basically ... can't oh ... yeah\nI I mean that's why I came here today even though I did have a little bit\nUm I just felt like it was important to even if I wasn't going to talk a lot to say Hi here I Am not exist on I felt like it was important\nEven though my wife couldn't be here with me you know I'm like no it's important I'm going to go and and speak up ... I don't think that people should be voting on human rights no issues but since here we are\nWe need to vote yes on this number three so that we can keep the it's a combination\nRight because the governor had already put it in the early their right to that and sixteen here\nRight because the governor had already put it in those early their right to that and sixteen here already put it in the law and he was the one who added gender identity to this list of\nFor other government other states to look at us as a state and what we've done so we vote yes on three they're going to look at it and go oh okay we can do that too if we don't then they're going to see how\nThe state discriminates against [noise] yeah and ... and also\nSome very important to vote because by just simple statistics probability if you don't vote you automatically vote for the winter yeah right you know so voted of how young were you wanted to see us today is\nYes vote yes on three [laughter] we'll just see less of a place\nLike you said that if we know the city of Trump for what he really wants he wants people to be like a ... cube people to not be allowed to go out in places it changed him up for what he really wants to do for our country\nYou know if there is also bigger fish to fry I mean we have situations where I was thinking about this this\nFish to fry I mean we have situations where I was thinking about this this week the lack of logic and all this as well that\nUm if if a Mr Trump is a fan of making friends with their enemies or certain countries like Russia\nAnd they're not enemies but you know I'm North Korea if he's a fan of making good with them\nWhy not make good with\nTransgender folks are eligible deep cue folks here in the United states of America that pay taxes here that had businesses here that actually contribute here if you want to be patriotic it makes sense to me to actually help people here at home\nMm yes and you know it's like instead of just having an agenda just because I'm you know a vice president is you know he's he's very a strong in his Catholic faith\nBut it doesn't mean he should be put in a position of the southern position or judge of judgment that's reserved for God Almighty alone whoever's UCs that to be and and it just us that occurred to me this week it makes no sense of you wants to make friends with other countries that have nuclear weapons they may have malevolent um\nDetention why not make friends here at home with your own Pete's I'm so he was very [laughter]\n... you know another thing that I'm trumped ... this week and he um was planning even more discrimination against releasing people because he is working on a\nFormal religious exemption to rules at the end federal contractors from discriminating against a algae beauty people so he can basically um put in\nReason why people came from other countries because they wanted to be free to do as they um precisely we're doing and that's why they came to America\nDo to to run from religious persecution or that there was one church in England the church of England I think gives ... ... an applicant or ... or ... or something like that not really sure about that but other people had a different faith\nYou know you want to be purely process so he won't be purely Catholic so ...\nIt's just um [noise] I mean just come so far you know with algae beauty right\nIn the previous administration and how many how much safe the we've had due to Obama and then for him to turn things around you know and backtrack things put us back in the closet every transgender people I mean I I just I Can't um [noise]\nI Can't even think about how um it might be kind of country um\nAnd I consider myself as a relatively conservative person\nYou know I don't I don't really agree with the far right I don't really agree with the far left either you know I'd like to pray about things and kind of listen to both sides and make an educated decision you know I honestly believe that the Obamas love people\nBecause they love themselves and they have a higher power and they offered many forms of social justice ... just as our governor did Charlie Baker God Bless them\nRight now and he put this provision in the law right you know for gender identity\nA liberal Republican Democrat he's a man that construct these these these are not nice\nCan sort of liberal Republican Democrat he's a man that construct these these these are not necessarily divine these are not necessarily God created these just\nWhere people we just we often do we like to put things in a box ... and it's not that's not fair either I mean my father had tried to get me to get out of my dogs you know God Bless you all the view that if you're listening I'm\nTo give me think outside the box just be your own person\n... you know\nOh you have to go for a break but we'll be right back okay\nOn Tuesday October thirtieth from five pm to ... pm the native regional chamber of commerce will hold its twenty ninth annual taste of the region\nAt tri county regional vote technical high school in Franklin taste of the region is an annual celebration of restaurants from all the sixteen communities that the United regional chamber serves attendees will have the opportunity to sample food from a variety of restaurants that are members of the chamber [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI'm a I'm\nA\n\nA\nOwn gender you know it's also for them to you know you have anyone that low that you love and love to help them out to\nAbsolutely because we are all on people who have [noise]\nYou know issues in our life you know there's stuff that happens and you know we all have to pay our taxes we all have we all have a place to live we all have and we're all people\nLike um those who are sis gender who are um male female or a lesbian gay sure bisexual it's all about um people being people\nYup and I'll remind our listeners the term ... means that your gender between your ears matches the sex between your legs\nThank you [noise] I I'm ...\nNow six o'clock we're just about done our show Toby I really want to say thank you again for coming and talking with us today and I'm being here and I'm like you to be a plus for having me absolutely and I\nI Do um once you just remind everybody that we do have a Facebook page it's called the quality time and everybody can make comments on the page you can ask quest\nAnytime

get people to understand what it's about and why everybody should be voting yes on three and then you know we'll have some time after that to talk about other topics um for algae beauty people and um so you can always\nGo to our Facebook page and contractors there yeah and perhaps even those who aren't eligible to teach you yes me this is the quality for everybody\nAnd I didn't mean to exclude
