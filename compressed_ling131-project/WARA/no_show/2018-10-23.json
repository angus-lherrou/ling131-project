city council candidate Taiwan them in as I said I Will be joining us just after the eight o'clock hour\nUh tomorrow in our third hour at a nickel a boy and Thursday morning will also be talking with Jon Davis right now a gym corporate now standing by with the latest updates on our forecast once again Jim\nWell I'm Still kind of dark out there although we start to see a little bit of light and also some clouds ... nine thousand feet now that's not a low overcast so\nIt's got to be a cloudy are mostly cloudy started to the day but not real dreary looking at least and certainly no rain around at the moment but we'll have a few a light rain showers mainly this afternoon again most of the day not raining temperatures reaching the mid fifties\nLens out of the southeast by twelve miles an hour again one or two showers through early evening and then a breaking clouds overnight again a revealing a sort of a peek a Boo Boo or one of those where the mood suddenly appears out of a break in the clouds and it goes back and\nWe all can picture that falling down to the low forties and then went back to sudden puffy clouds breezy tomorrow I have about fifty\nThe low forties and then went back to the sun and puffy clouds breezy tomorrow I have about fifty Thursday mid forties so a colder end of the week with a mid thirties by Thursday morning Thursday morning maybe a touch of light process but I think will be enough when that it'll stay up\nUh but friday morning is another one that we're going to drop several degrees below freezing after\nAgain reaching the mid forties we drop into the mix it up or twenties by friday morning recover back to the mid forties all these temperatures are below average by varying degrees are average high now fifty seven fifty eight so today is about as close as we'll get\nThat over the weekend we'll go watch a coastal storms developing again if we get some ah area of opportunity to be outside and not worry about too much the way of rain that would be early Saturday developing rain Saturday throughout the day the timing still\nA bit in question this far out but I Would say that certainly by Saturday afternoon and certainly Saturday Night rain and gusty winds will be in the area of temperatures on Saturday or not getting out of the mid forties with the north east when\nBoth sort of an early season a nor'easter a potential on Saturday especially in the afternoon\nAnd some of that rain to linger into a portion of Sunday Sunday getting a little milder but still do a picnic certainly a hive about fifty\nOr with lingering showers late in the day maybe a touch of missed and then if we go into next week\nStill a chance of a shower on Monday upper level features swinging through but it begins to quiet down and the good news right now it does look like we're going to get the rain over with that as I was thinking uh about a week ago\nSomething would happen before Halloween and then drying out for Halloween and that's why now when I think what's gonna happen Tuesday again next Tuesday a week from today southern cloud probably somewhere in the fifties\nWith a dry conditions and it looks dry for trick or treating on Wednesday a week from tomorrow you can you believe that uh yeah Wednesday a week from tomorrow is Halloween and it looks like we're going to have dry weather I pro probably throw out some\nWednesday a week from tomorrow is Halloween and it looks like we're gonna have dry weather I pro probably throw out some Ortiz in low fifty something like that and then some indications as we begin the month of November which of course is next Thursday November first\nAh put perhaps potentially a couple of my old days they be getting into the sixties by a Thursday and friday of next week and then maybe some showers by the weekend but let's not worry about that now so the news of the morning ... is that right now it's looking more and more like it will not rain on Halloween one thing we will not have as well\nDawn because of the alignment of what we're getting right now in the skies they will not be through Halloween and the evening they will not be a moon out on Halloween\nNo no we will not say see that and that's for sure and I know it was it a couple of years ago or was it last year that we had um we had a a full moon on Halloween nights\nI think it was maybe a couple of years ago yeah yeah now they will be a moon late at night last quarter so you know late at night on Halloween one two in the morning there'll be a moon rising but of course\nThat's when most of the everything is done so there is going to be a move and what I'm saying there's no moon but the classic time he wants to see the moon on Halloween is obviously late afternoon in the evening when this trick or treating going on but that will not be the case this time one thing that might happen as I said last week as well dawn is that if the game the world series does go seven games\nIt would be Halloween evening a four game seven hopefully maybe that won't happen to the red Sox won before them\nA and also by the way next week if if it works well Tuesday and Wednesday if there are game six and seven which comes back to Fenway after three games of Los Angeles right now the weather looks okay for both those ... days so\nThe real only game in question in terms of of rain is today's game tonight skinny but even that looks miner or they'll likely will be most of the light ranch hours before the game starts and then it starts to dry out during the game so that that is certainly some good news ah and by the way it was\nUh during the game so that that is certainly some good news ah and by the way dominant was of the fifth time\nOne hundred years ago that the red Sox won the world series in Nineteen Eighteen of course they want it for previous times back to one of the Nineteen oh three\nAnd in fact before Nineteen once they want it Nineteen Eighteen the red Sox were overall the class of all of baseball um that was you know even better than the Yankees the Yankees had won anything in New York for the most part\nA Nineteen Eighteen they one day a fifth\nWorld Series against the Chicago Cubs and Nineteen Eighteen I think forward it to them it was only six game series so the only one six games and but yeah the red Sox were big so by Nineteen Eighteen exactly one hundred years ago this fall the red Sox were the king of all of baseball winning five out of\nLike a you know about Fifteen Years and\nThen of course the curse kicked in and they didn't win them again until a two thousand for a few years ago so I'm kind of interesting that the red Sox exactly a hundred years ago and of course I notice the book out uh with that are coming out recently ah but that was it for a hundred years up until a few years ago\nYeah we'll talk about that book because our the author of that book Taiwan and man who was running for counsel I Will be joining us in Studio ... late ... or the other thing that I that are talking about the red Sox and the Dodgers when they play\nAh the Dodgers are at a on the on the west coast or in a couple of nights a games in ... and we'll probably be a little later around here because it's a three hour delay\nYeah well apparently from what I understand all games except one are going to be at eight or nine eastern time so\nAh there won't be cause any day game was there used to be years ago but it's all in the money obviously I think I heard that the Sunday night game which of course is I think that would be game five and a that most likely will be played uh\nThis is I think the that would be game five in a that most likely will be played a unless someone wins it in four straight that one is I think at eight Fifteen but all the other games are eight or nine which means\nUh you know that the thing about being on the west coast that means they will they get to see the game started just after five in the afternoon so from what I understand them all the games are right at eight or nine except\nFor one of them Sunday at eight Fifteen from and I think I heard yesterday so it's unfortunate for the kids you know to uh you know not you know be able to stay up or many other people as well they'd have to get up early you know I think I one game and the whole series did I see the end of\nAh this past series with the red Sox 'cause you've got to get up early you can't stay up until midnight\nAnd that's the big argument that they've had over the years you know oh well we've got to police the west coast and the TV people so we we can start it before five\n\nTo

Glenn Miller\nSo that is what our older seniors would remember uh-huh exactly yeah\n\nSo I as I go around the city and there's over eight thousand seniors now\nAnd that's and I've been told is the fastest growing population in the city there are a lot of people though who are worried that they're going to lose their homes\nAnd it's it's kind of um it's it's it's frightening to them I supported the new high school it was ... it was that it's in bad shape who we need to say we need a new one\nAnd many of our seniors did supported the many of them were also thinking about their own personal pocketbook and are living on a fixed incomes and art are concerned that some day down the road they're not going to be able to make their payments\nAnd they might lose their homes\nAnd that grabbed me very early in the campaign\nAnd I've been wondering you know how how do we handle that because we needed a new high school too and I'm hearing lately that there's several bills going on in the state house\nOr they're still in committee stage at least I'm to the ... there's three three bills to bills or in committee stage one passed in that flurry of ...\nThree bills to bills or in committee stage one passed in that flurry of bills on July thirty first I haven't even heard if the governor signed it or not I don't know where the status and that bill lifestyle\nAnd I don't know what the Senate's going to do about version of the similar bills but they're all designed to help seniors with their property tax whether it's to put a cap on a certain age say just pick an age like Seventy five where they would never have to pay any higher\nThat would be the highest they ever go for property tax or another bill which I'm not sure is where I Would go is to is to provide loans to seniors who who need help getting through the next property tax payment\nUm however however it comes out if any of those bills get through the process and then the governor signs them I Would take a very close look and I'd be inclined to support help for our seniors\nAnd I I found out that there are cities around the country that have done something like this the most notable being Houston which gives seniors a great tactic property tax break or when they hit sixty five years old right\nAnd um and I recently spoke to a woman who came to my church and I asked her to verify that she lives in Houston just said absolutely true she told me that when you're sixty five you know you don't have to pay property tax anymore that's kind of unbelievable\nYou know if you don't you talk about all these things that are going on especially here in the city and and um [noise] you know being um um and hopefully if all goes well in just two weeks from today uh the election um you can bring a lot to the city council I Know\nUh the election [noise] um you can bring a lot to the city council I Know that for for a you know listening to your topics and listening to 'em and getting to know a little bit you on line and stuff like that [noise]\nAh first of all what I can hear I can hear the passion first of all I can hear the passion that you do want to work for the city of Alabama who has a new city councilor [noise]\nOne thing that you do you just said you want to help a lot of the seniors which I think is outstanding because a lot of these people don't know sometimes they don't know the future they don't know what's going to go on\nAs you have now the other thing is that I Know that you're very passionate about new business you know a lot of people you know you see Albert was very vibrant number of years ago there's still a lot of businesses and the out of her area can you bring back some of the city can you bring back the city or like\nI mean there's a lot of things going on or is that something that you would look at in the in the in the near future\nYes absolutely it's um it's not a crusade I Would be alone in ... I'm sure there's a number of counselors if not all of them who would love to love to help revive the city economically\nUm I Would uh first and foremost I Would support a new economic development director\nWe have not had one and a few years and it's it's kind of a mystery to me how how come the person previous person left I'm sure there are people who know that the mystery is how did we let several years passed without an economic director uh-huh\nSo that is in the mayor's budget\nAnd I will support that\nAnd hopefully within a matter of a few months will be able to start moving forward with this\nWithin a matter of a few months will be able to start moving forward with the new director um I Would love to work closely with the chamber of commerce\nOr I Would also\nUh I Would like to see a new ... a plan and if there is a plan forgive me because I'm not aware of it\nBut I Would like to see a an actual plan of how the council and the mayor would like to see the city look downtown in say ten years mhm\nAnd then if you don't have a plan then how do you get to where you want to go right right very\nTrue you don't view I mean you've got a lot of the\nProjects that are right now going under ... you know going out as well you've got the uh the recently with the uh the new Robbins riverfront park right now with the uh the new ribbon cutting for the uh the trail that goes between that place and over to the ... river walk behind\nA behind the car dealership and behind Cumberland Farms you've got a lot of other projects going on um you know they're still looking at supposedly going to clean up a little bit more of the site of riverfront park there right but there's a lot of other things going out you know years ago you know I've lived in the city now for\nSince two thousand and\nOne or two where whatever why they are two thousand one but I've actually been around the city since Nineteen eighty four\nAnd I've seen a lot of things going on a I think our borough in very proud to be an out of a resident and one thing there there are that I've I've seen and talked to a lot of other people including former state representative John leper and a few other people\nUm ... are there still ... they're stuck there must be a few brown fields that are still left in the city\nAre there still they're stuck there must be a few brown fields that are still left in the city\nI'm I'm sure there are I I Can't think specifically where I've seen a few but I I Know in my travels yeah this this summer I did see a couple\nI what what I'd like to see this this is exactly what I'm I've seen a lot of them which is really really nice a lot of conservation area that have been dedicated to certain different people in our area and I could count maybe ... or at least half a dozen or more sites\nThat Albert has ah that are strictly for conservation areas\nAh people walking trails and right and that the trees and all this is a ...

least almost Twenty years now as well more like thirty or thirty yeah I my first six years were\nThem state school oh yeah okay and uh that's where I first began being a social worker bringing back to the table um\nCombat help a little bit becoming a new city council I think so I was thinking about that this morning actually um I think I think it helps you listen for one thing and be accepting of all types of people\nHunting and be accepting of all types of people\nAnd ah not judge people\nIt's one of the problems with politics in this day and age is that we've separated ourselves into into different camps and the whole idea of getting to um to value people who have have different priorities is is it's like something of the past\n... well that that isn't me you have\nTo learn if you're a social worker you have to learn to work with all kinds of\nPeople and um to show them that are that you're hearing the concern and the uh priorities that they have you may not agree with them but you hear them yeah so\nYou know in in the council I think you you you need to I\nI Would look at ... upon it as a team that's working together towards common goals it it may be a different way to get to the goal\nBut we all care about outer borough mhm we all care about our seniors are children um the land that we have here that we want to want to take care of that we've been entrusted with it's just how we go about getting their\nRight and you know [noise] um and then of course being with the uh you know walking around in a drive riding your bike around and talking to different people\nAre there are there has been a lot of questions you know you're talking about um a land students are seniors or whatever you know the ... the school as you said you're back the the new high school which hopefully uh they'll get underway in the spring\nI'm that's gonna it's gonna be a I think uh uh I think it's going to be a good positive outlook for the city\nThe uh I think it's going to be a good positive outlook for the city uh you know down the line they're going to take some of that land from across the way from extra parking yeah uh you know from one of the the holes there on the on the at the former golf course [noise]\nUm but there's a lot of other things out there I mean I've had this is the school committee members here in Studio with us or talking about it uh before the vote last time\nAnd everybody is was published behind this you know a lot of the ... some people say okay here and there and you know there wasn't that many people here and there you know for but overall\nThere were enough votes to get it through you know I'm\nA when the when they were here with us I'm a few months ago they kind of talked about they're passionate about this you see it as well I mean this I mean it is will it bothers some of the the seniors out there I Know I've talked to some of the people at the senior center like you as well\nSome of them say oh I I don't know if I can afford this but down the line it's really not going to be taken a huge chunk out of the seniors pocketbooks\nI I I'd like to think that's true mhm I think right now we're we're living in an era of anxiety yeah how will this change our individual financial situation\nBut it's going to be spread over enough time that I I Believe we will be able to handle this and for those who can't\nLet's find a way to support that and that's what I'm looking at right now\nAnother project going on right now talking about other things going on ah the former job center on mechanic St ... is being turned into apartments or something that um the city does need because there is a lot of people who that you see a lot of times that may not be having available\nIs a lot of people who that you see a lot of times that may not be having available veil abilities for people to place to live um I think that's a that's a good thing and not too far right there are a mechanic street you've got you've got the ponds you've got mechanics pond you've got the ten most river not too far away from it [noise]\nUm some very very nice areas I mean right down the streets the former a golf course there are with those uh those houses

we possibly can\nUm some of the seniors talking about the senior center um\n[noise] uh especially going to the senior center here in our borough you've worked with them you see of talk to them I Know that you you were you were very passionate about this as well speaking with Madeline McNeely and ... and ... and her crew there I'm One of the top senior centers in this whole state of Massachusetts I think\nI think they're doing a wonderful job and as I said you are you see a lot of growth with them them as well I mean they do a wonderful job we have them we have the staff here on a monthly basis\nAre talking about uh some of the programs are going through going forward with the loss of senior center um where do you see them going on in the near future and the next five years\nFive years\nI Know that they're building they'd like to get a new a bill yeah but that sometimes are with with money and stuff like that I Know they recently got a brand new roof recently and then and I know parking is tough for them as well\nOne thing I think I'd like to see is a an expansion\nOf the uh [noise]\nVolunteers you know the program where you if you work Seventy five Seventy five hours\nFallen tears you know the program where you if you work Seventy five I Believe it's Seventy five hours a year right and we have a list of approximately six hundred people who are volunteering around the city many of them in places like the senior center or the library\nAnd uh so I Would like to see that list expanded\nBecause I Know that there are people who um would would like to volunteer their time and you get a break on your property tax doing that and I I if it's possible to expand that list I'd like to see that expanded because there's been people who have been waiting now for quite a while yeah\nThey they really have that is but but I Know Madeline is is I'm feeling like the building is\nIs is getting kind of tight mhm yeah you know I'm I refer people they're constantly to their to social workers because they do and absolutely wonderful job\nSo I'm I say to all seniors if you haven't experienced the senior center this is the time and if you want to have your property taxes I don't mean property tax your tax returns are helped in the spring\nOr doing your tax work or they do a wonderful volunteer program over there for taxes they sure do they sure do

A. R. I. N. all over the world that W. A. R. A. radio dot com my girl bill by Jim Stafford agent six writes game one of the Nineteen sixty seven World Series was on October for\nUnder the same schedule today excuse me under the same ... today\nIt would have been a T shirt and Halter top whether off off off and remember the seventies folks the worst the worst fashion statement of all time the leisure suit and perhaps for the feminine half of the species the greatest fashion statement of all time [noise]\nThe good old fashioned Halter top I I just need a moment\nOh\nSBA angel saying to the invention of the Halter top now the angels us thing again oh 'cause it's time to speak to the amazing Jim Corbin hello Jim\nHello Paul yeah hey\nWell I'll tell you that I hadn't heard that one in a while from Stafford there that was a good one\nGirl bill yeah um I got a request for spiders and snakes which I should have on her but you know I whenever there's a major hit I Try to find the the the lesser hit and I thought I\nWhenever there's a major hit I Try to find the the the lesser hit and I bought my girl built in it\nYeah that was probably thirty five years for me not hearing that but anyway yeah we've got a couple of rain showers coming in Paul this afternoon or just enough to wet the ground really in most areas or we're\nGoing to raise the mid fifties I'd still looking at a temperature right around forty nine degrees of game time so it's certainly not exactly baseball temperature but it has been worst I'll let you know quickly in just a minute when that was the world series\nA and also again or the wind will be fairly late tonight so that's the good news the wind ... not much of an issue blowing likely ultra right center the way it looks with the alignment of the park as you know I like to always figure that out now tonight falling back eventually to the low forties late at night any light rain shovel and\nSetting the stage for a brighter day tomorrow now we have had glimpses of a sudden this morning tomorrow a little more of a mixed with a few clouds highs about fifty so a little bit cooler and today by a few degrees\nTomorrow evening the cold air moved back in and that is the game really that the weather could have an influence on a more likely a wind averaging Fifteen to twenty miles an hour forty four degrees but wind chill in the thirties\nSo the big question of course will be will David Price have something on his throwing hand like a glove which is a apparently not ever been used on the throwing hand or else they'll get typically fingers and use that as an excuse if he doesn't do well so anyway we'll find out that on Thursday sunshine\nWe discovered that yesterday Jim he's going to use one of those nice little mufflers they call them you know the same thing pro quarterbacks use right in front of the little belly there the little muffled that they get their hands in between play yeah so they stay warm cuddly also recommended by manicurist so the skin on your hand doesn't try out\nYou could also put a foreign substance in that and they'll never know right on the ball drop what a perfect place to hide Vaseline now why not otherwise have they use that\nWow what a perfect place to hide Vaseline now\nWhy not by the way have they use that as a pitcher done that in coal games over the years one of those in baseball or is that are you is this could be the\nKind that you'll hear medicine if I thought of it then I then I sincerely doubt that any major league baseball player or manager actually would even consider that idea so [laughter] well\nHave to see if the ... fingers are set in tomorrow evening 'cause it'll be quite a bit colder wind blowing out to right field tomorrow I'd northwest wind blows out to right field at Fenway so it's going to be a little tougher to get over the green monster better to get to right field tomorrow night by the way when they get back to LA Paul\n... eighty five degrees or because they're starting at five o'clock course at LA Times so a five just after five o'clock I looked at the weather for LA eighty five all three days at game time so what a change now as we go into the friday timeframe this week\nFrost in the morning like we had friday morning a heavy frost right as it was as we've had Monday morning\nA heavy frost yesterday morning and then reach in the mid forties sunshine galore good news for the football games high school football friday evening should be dry\nNot much wind probably somewhere down you're forty degrees though who then as we get into Saturday yeah quiet and cold I I Would describe the weather for friday evening fall and of course\nUh the full moon rising as the games go on to probably arising around seven o'clock eight o'clock then as we go into the weekend still monitoring what the remains of Willa talk about an old fashioned name\nThis show is a quality time yes at that five on friday\n... five to six yes excellent\nAnd then followed up by that with a high school football groups who at five o'clock we're trying to a treat everyone well and then at seven o'clock on Friday nights were broadcasting kids trying to balance each other's heads but oh well that's why it's broadcasting narrow casting Laurie\nI'm\nA first thing I'll just give us a quick um don't want to promote your show first of all um what is your show about and what motivated you to bring your show to the air\nWell I the snow is about equality and that's what the name is four yup but also we want to make sure that people\nHave a place to listen to know that everybody is included nobody is excluded this specifically for ... people yup and ah what made me start the show was basically radio station\nUm put out a notice things to come and learn about the radio and I actually I was in broadcasting or\nIn my when I was really long time ago I won't say how long but [laughter] I went to school for it for a while my associate's degree and then um I thought I like to do something to show it\nAnd then um I thought I'd like to do something to show equality and especially that we're in Massachusetts and you know what I thought was an equal um landing place um to do something like that you\nKnow we're we're due to go to school for broadcasting and do they ever teach you to talk like a Nineteen seventies em DJ who's way relaxed and way cool\n[laughter] I went to college oh uh yeah so uh I did um\nLearn to be on the radio but also TV so major um you know different things in broadcasting\nExcellent where did you grow up I well I grew up in Maine actually oh what part are in the southern part it's ... it's you know near Freeport you know we're a little being as yeah where are you ... you know people know where that is more than before they'll know where your arm at this [laughter]\nAll right ah do you have a what what what are we going to be the subject of your show this Friday afternoon for\nWell for the past few weeks I've we've been talking about question three years\nAnd why people should vote yes on question three um and each week I had\nA guest on the show I've had I'm a high school senior um who's trans I've had in middle school girls who is also trans um I've had allies from the flag with his parents and friends of lesbians and gays um come and talk on the show\nI I'm this week I'm going to have a family come I'm the\nFather of the family is trans um and and the woman and two kids going to come and talk about about their views on question three and a lot of people should vote yes\nOkay a couple of things one could you give our audience a brief overview of exactly what question three years and are included in that case\nOverview of exactly what question three years and are included in that kind of a warning 'cause the question is deceptively worded a no vote as far as I Know\nMeans we maintain the rights we currently have for the O. J. P. T. Q. community a yes vote means we deny rights to fellow human beings is that correct actually now you have it upside down rat's nest fall ... told me that yesterday your fault that [laughter]\nYou know everybody said vote yes on three which yes we'll be keeping the vote by keeping the gender\nIdentity provision in the public accommodation law so public accommodation says everywhere that you can go that's not work school or home yeah that where people congregate\nAnd the governor put this provision on the law back into that isn't sixteen and so a yes vote with the take keep a provision on law\nExcellent good thank you for clearing that up for me I'm up on the L G B. T. Q. community ah we've made so much progress\nOf people um again if you don't understand someone from a different group or get to know them and you find out that people just like you are ... people have a gay friend or family member either male or female or most husbands are fine with the by sexuality part\nBecause of their heart of hearts they hope that their wife and her best friend will get together with him in the room so they're fine with that um\nIt's the tea a lot of people have trouble with the tea the transgender issue that's where I draw the line um they haven't come across them as much in their daily life\nAnd it's really a the L. J. B. Q. movement was making such progress for so many years and then those darn T came came along\nSuch progress for so many years and then those darn tea to bill came along but tease the drug genders and scared the snot\nOut of a lot of people would do to combat that\nThat the tea or the transgender people are just like everybody else you know they are being the people who they are\nSupposed to be in their brain you know that it's ever people don't understand that that gender is it between your ears and sex is between your legs so\nThe gender part people may have and when they were born they were born as a certain sex ... and then and um they don't believe that the gender that they should be\nSo if they need to change their body because they can't change their brain yet so you say um I actually got that from my co host on the show um if ... if you're listening um that was for you know she she says that often on a\nOn a show about trying to talk to people about what transgender is you know that it's um Sanders between your ears [laughter] so\nAnd we we get a lot of um remote correspondence you know Texas with Colin when this question comes up look if you're born with a Johnson Johnson you're a man if ... you're a girl and that's it what's all this other stuff going on so just once again for those people who refuse to hear\nExplain the difference between sexual identity and gender identity\nOh well I'm not transgender so I Can't really totally um you know I don't have the experience of it up so I'm only saying that if you are born with it\nUm and you made me born one gender but inside young or not that gender you feel like you are the other person you know that's that's your actual identity is the other\nLike you are the other person you know that's that's your actual identity is the other gender and\nPeople should it not really what is it really matter there was a um\nMy daughter and wild yup he read a um things on Facebook and what it said was\nThat you don't understand what somebody's gender is a person on the street here's how you do it step one don't worry about it it really doesn't what that really does it affect each person what um everybody else identifies as we need to accept people as they are\nAnd how that person is is maybe a different gender than what they were born us\nAnd it's interesting the whole question three a lot of the people who were opposed to question three\nNo any man can put a wig on and go into public bathrooms and abuse your wife girlfriend your daughters for heaven's\nSakes and that is completely against what the research in this study has shown in today's column in the Boston Globe irony Graham trends lives are literally under attack in two thousand Seventeen twenty eight transgender people were murdered\nMassachusetts recorded this year the first known trans homicide victim when Christ elite steal a new new neutral and up north Adams was stabbed to death by her husband with twenty other murders nationwide two thousand Eighteen major metro surpassed last year's horrible record\nAnd on the other side of that there was not a single police report on record\nNot one of show men putting some lumberjack putting on a wig and going into a women's bathroom and abusing a woman it is it's it's unbelievable how the opponents was questioned three have completely turn on the issue around\nThis with the weather without this law people can get\nWe turn the issue around this with the weather without this law people can do that and they feel it's still a legal\nRight now it has nothing to do with this law yeah it really has nothing to do with it this law is\nJust for dignity for people to be able to go to the bathroom that's all they want to do you want to go to the bathroom that they identify as ... you know and I I'm I'm gonna I'm quoting\nUm the high school senior who is on our show a couple of weeks ago and he said you know he passes that's what they call when you um\nNow look more like the gender that you identify as he passes as a man so if this\nLaw where it could be taken away he'd have to go into a female bathrooms and that would be more scary for the for the female then because he passes for a male yeah so it isn't that what they don't want they don't want males ...\nThrough it and it looked like males to go and female\nAnd and um again as long as someone's using a stall what difference does make a we have the way we deal with the problem here at W. will re in double a Shia studios or we have for for bathrooms into building\nAnd uh there's not a men's room or a woman sign on any of them you have wide open take it\nOkay and then age of forty eight writes tell her his name as President Trump she keeps calling him Trump that's annoying hell I don't even go that far Laurie I don't even use his name I just call him his will say to others\nAs soon as he show some respect for the office of the presidency maybe people like us will show a little more respect and use the on arithmetic of president but it's not just drop remember we took away Jim carbons amazing title for a while as well\nSo we're uh we're full service I'm due to do and that's agent to twenty four okay All right Laurie anything else you want to add before we let you go\nAll out and it is um I Hope that other people a lesson to the show on friday at five o'clock here right here I mean they are a\nExcellent and or I Want to thank you very much for joining us and I think it was pretty good practice 'cause on this show you got to be exposed to people who just agree with you which is a healthy part of life I guess\nBeing with people who agree with you and disagree with you and it's nice to get your ideas challenge and once in a while but I still think you're on the side of good morally and legally I Try to be Laurie thank you so much for joining us hope lots of people tune in next friday afternoon at five o'clock\nYes thank you very much for having me\nAll right

A. R. A. I sincerely apologize we didn't get to a a lot about remote correspondence that came in they really poured in a lot of them were um repetitive\nUm so I just chose one to read as opposed to reading every single one of them and I'm\nNot going to put it on one of the questions was why she getting angry every time you ask a question I don't think that was anger I I think that's a\nI think there's a little frustration though where people just trying to live their lives\nJust trying to get through the day nobody from the trans community wants to or the L G. P. T. Q. community wants to take any ... any straight person's rights away\nThey just want to be treated equally that's all I don't think that's too much to ask we'll be right back on the other side here at Thirteen twenty W.

but I'm working on correcting that [noise]\nUm yeah um what I what my subject was going to be is why so many people are pushing\nTheir ideas on people that are in roles\nAnd um I I resent the fact that they're telling me how to vote I vote the way I Want okay and nobody can convince me at this point that I'm wrong\nOr anything of any issues specifically or is that just a general statement\nThat the general statement about this upcoming election and questions as rarely portion ... agenda mhm and I've had many phone calls and most of them I just say I do do surveys\nI don't tell you how I'm going to vote\nYes I Will tell you that I Am voting but that's it my\nChoice is my choice and I'm willing to listen and I have listened to both sides and I have made up my mind\nAnd I have listened to both sides and I have made up my mind after doing a lot of looking around and finding out what this is all about\nSee that's the difference just for those who may be new or to the show are not familiar with you it's not that you're close minded and you have your thoughts and don't want to hear any outside thoughts that you've researched it on your own and they don't need someone calling you in the struggling you while you're trying to watch the movie best with the play\nWas a ridiculous political argument I was gonna say normally before the elections I Know well before the elections who I'm going to vote for what my position is\nOne referendum I Am really really um at odds having internal battle with myself over this question one about the nerves staffing rates this is the first time in a long time I've heard a lot about this issue and I still don't know which way I'm going to go\nWell I Do okay because I have a daughter that's in the nursing field and I know the health she has gone through to get help yeah and it's been at her job over twenty five years at the same place and she has gone through hell\nTrying to get help to tend to everybody and companies that own\nMedical facilities\nUm do not want to put out a lot of money and they they put a sign out yeah they need them but when you go to apply that money off that isn't what the person walk yeah it's a date out get high it\nAnd so I ... her and I have discussed this issue\nA lot and she's told me how to\nYou like about it you know and I have done that it's interesting though are driving in today before\nAnd I have done that\nIt's interesting that are driving in today before he got in the range of W way already I was listening to NPR and they had a a marketing specialist on who played to ads from the pro yes people into ads from the new people and then pointed out how all four of ads all four of those ads to for to against\nWere completely full of brooms and use warped statistics and as we all know there were allies there are damned lies and then there are statistics\nWhile we all know that the most of the hospital with well I I'm not going to speak for ... some of the hospital supply that lay out their bottom line is important to them and and I have great some of the Boston hospitals\nAre not privately owned and they were they're rarely I had a lot of dealings with wind in past years and um\nBut and some of the nursing facilities where the Iraq I'm nursing homes and assisted living um they're all privately owned now and they're out to the bottom line because\nI got to tell me that you know I mean Steve asked by help bells ringing and he was running back and\nForth thing you know what happens when an earth is over\nDone or they get sick\nAnd there it is a I we're up against a bracing they've got to let you go I Will say in my experience with my friends and family I've never seen anyone desperately waiting for a nurse at a hospital I saw lots of instances where either ... or some other resident of nursing homes had to wait a logs from time to get any kind of attention I've\nHad experience with the local hospital or three years\nTo get any kind of attention I've had experience\nWith a local hospital or three years ago and it was that what I thought it used to be yeah so it did change back\nOkay if I have a great day All right go Red Sox will be thinking of it and I'd say I'd have that Red Sox sure I'd I'd I Am All right take care Bye bye there she goes Sandy from out of\nOral All right through the Boston Globe came out against question\nOne day I did and I I got it right here yeah I got it right here\nI'm seriously I cannot think of a single other referendum question and\nThat what I've read so much about right and to that I've gone back and forth so much about and the thing I keep coming back to and I really going to get to a break\nI don't think this is the right forum no I really don't because now we're going to have thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people would absolutely positively no experience right in hospital management telling hospitals how to do their job correct but then I think it was ages six rage and Seventy one of them\nBottom line they put patient safety ahead of hospital profits if you want to make it that black and white\nIf it would make it that black and white and okay I agree with that I put patient safety ahead of hospital profits too but I don't think it's that black and white there were small hospitals there aren't gigantic hospitals there were a great nursing homes there were a lousy nursing homes\nAnd I just think we should let nursing home administrators in hospitals administrators\nDo their job and if you're a nurse was not happy when you're working and don't think you're getting support trust me now is a pretty good time for a nurse ... to go look for a job and get a job somewhere else\nIssue is that everybody agrees that this is a poorly written bill yeah a poorly written bill and it only applies to a certain subsection of nurses that only applies to acute care that's it while when you're\nOnly applies to acute care that's it while when you're emergency rooms yeah you're talking about nursing homes yeah that doesn't apply to nursing homes\nThat's\nYou're sure I'm pretty sure okay well just like I misquoted net earlier obviously let me see two or three days ago I was having a conversation with someone who was pretty darn convinced it they concluded nursing homes as well it's just hospitals just acute care but even hospitals\nHospitals treat for you know treat some people with bad colds\nAnd they treat other people with heart disease cancer amputations there's wow wow it's just I I don't\nI like the principal I liked the principal the state should\nMake sure that people are properly cared for\nBut I I chose your show me the statistics that says they're not see that's\nWe and we've had remote correspondence a one woman who I feel terrible for she was in a hospital overnight and couldn't get a ... a nurse in a room for hours\nIn how you doing I'm doing right so you have an I voted early yes like just a sticker on are you going to do like Adonis brag and vote again on November sects of course going not early and often\nThat's why I don't think that I'm joking folks that is what you devious Democrats do yeah um and then I'm trying to see\nNo one does or again to don't forget to play my request three more remote correspondence coming I just can't keep up right now you know especially without a producer or an intern or anybody like that um I have trouble\nTalking and thinking at the same time talking thinking operating the board keeping an eye on the computer and monitoring the tax and good thing no chewing gum at the same time that's five things five things yeah\nI Can't multitask which is two things and I'm asking myself to do five think speaking of the uh uh I was yes I was worth a or a debt at a\nResearcher say aliens might be purple no that's not at Monsanto loses in court and I'd write new you know that that's not it to me that they they are the award was lowered Monsanto still lost white woman demands to

symphony performance oh no in Sweden unbelievable a fist fight broke out during a symphony over gum wrapper ...\nUnbelievable [noise] imagine a violent wouldn't have been it would have been if the\nWoman unwrapping the gum was a transgender woman ... yeah yeah yeah it's a no sympathy for those people are usually quite as we say ... mild mannered according to witnesses the woman was rustling her pack of gum until a man next to her\nGrabbed it from her and threw it on the floor ooh\nAt first they say she sat quietly but once the crowd started cheering after the conclusion of the piece she smacked his glasses off wow so at least she waited until there was other noise and the story of forging retaliated yeah the fight that escalated as the person the woman was joined it uh the the person the woman was\nWith joined in punching the gum tossing man in the stomach yes folks a fist fight at a symphony yeah well by the way damned if you are listening\nThen you know I hate to criticize you

letter of the law it might cause a lot of problems no we still haven't decided my vote on that either I agree it's very difficult\nAbout nursing I'm well carols nurse so yeah and I for a couple of years I handled in my claim adjusting career handled medical malpractice claims oh that must have been interesting it was really really interesting but it was also incredibly sad\nBecause back in my day if a medical ... was four inches thick\nThat was four inches four inches of medical documents yeah regarding the treatment of the patient right nowadays it's three three inches of legal mumbling ... yeah it legal gambling medical file is four inches thick you're absolutely right in a hurry and a half\nInches of absolute complete useless crappy worthless paperwork that nurses have to fill out because a lawsuit filed by some attorney you know years ago and one half inch one half inch\nOf the four inch medical file while actually concerns actually\nConcerns the patient the patient care

O. N. G. U. E. yeah that's correct\nOkay I had the owner you next to each other and that's how you know you're around it was a foreign word that's why I didn't corrective you want to make take matters literally into your own hands on\nSlap irritating coworker day that is totally totally on you so come back with me wants you to a wonder who comes up with these things [laughter]\nYeah they're the most of them are quite Hillary okay this is April fourth two thousand and six when this happened April for two thousand a sexual Elmo gallon I\nMet at W. RC and marched two thousand three okay ... three years previous and again it was hate at first sight he just didn't like my act\nI grew to hate Mike Mike hated me right off the bat and it's part of the Frank Foley shows tough 'cause I was the senior executive producer he was the news guy or the real producer on the microphone and Frank's trying to do a show\nWell to co workers are battling it out behind the scene yeah [laughter] so I finally finally on April for two thousand and six that's when these it popped\nThat's when the dam broke\nTwo thousand and six that's when these it popped\nThat's when the dam broke a that's when it came to a head\nA and we ended up after truly vile threats against each other yeah of laughing hysterically yeah and we've been friends good friends from that day forward that's great that's great and as we say we don't know Mike and I don't know how we became friends but we do know it was an accident\nSo come back with me now to win the dam broke it's called a strange act of God probably but who cares so here it is April for two thousand and six\nReports are great attorney good guy a very well connected and they do a great job want to thank attorney rich wrap party for sponsoring\nA during the news break biking and Paul had a fight [laughter] I I was just yelling that he was going to come in at the punch Mikey and I have a ... said he wanted a log time this was a legitimate because I was angry yeah Mike He responded by saying I'll stab you go [laughter]\n\nIn the three minutes and we were in the news you know I've never heard such violent threats [laughter]\nFrom a pace the white peace loving ... right right and it's taken a long time ago Mike I've known him since what Mars two thousand and three and that's the first time I said I wanted to punch it right right [laughter] problem Mike you said he wants to stab you at least ten times as well and you are all wind up over it\nAnd he's in there giggling God I'm just going to stab you I don't think you'd even stop I don't know I look at my sister's [laughter] he's got scissors in there\nBut the funny thing is though he is he's complaining about the computer or the board messing up in there and I said why don't you just do it right yeah and that's what set amount\nThat I really I make many mistakes I make more mistakes than anyone here and I admit it well so what I'm Talking about a technical issue that's not my fault I don't appreciate being belittled\nSo what I'm Talking about a technical issue that's not my fault I don't appreciate being belittled ... here's the thing though you people wherever you work and your work everywhere uh obviously you've got there's some conflict at work but I find it hard to believe\nThat of all the listeners on the way to work how many people are going to hear an exchange like that at work I'm going to punch you [laughter] I'm coming in there to put you and the response was fine I'll stab\nYou have to reverse\nI [laughter] I just don't think that goes on in most places a business that's all and if it does\nSomebody sitting down with the people that human resource back and I'm thinking I Want to watch this [laughter] I wouldn't have stopped you but you're right I Would have gone hills is going in there to play that he's going to stab you put all your right Mike kept laughing we kept ... be bright green right\nAfter last Oh yes led me to believe he really will stab at that point I'll be honest\nWith you like and I'm sure if somebody a third party heard that like wherever you if you work in a cubicle or or or it's a machine shop or something a third party would have alerted somebody\nThat their case in a an accounting or whatever wherever you're headed you know what I mean one guy's got a pair of scissors the other guy's head's red ... and they're threatening each other with violence and by the way seven in the morning I Know\nThat only artist I don't think that happens very often I'd be honest I meant it to I Know I don't know why I don't understand heated to that's the piece of the puzzle I think you overlook\nIf you went in there and took a swing at him you would have come out of their ... what some scissors embedded somewhere in your body which point we'd have a third problem which would be me rolling on the floor last on April call nine one one\n[laughter] and I made that point\nNine one one [laughter] and I made that point you asleep [laughter] that that recording that divulge what call\n... tried go over and that lack of course I I just have them at some point I just I got a call you back [laughter] so the death wherever [laughter] wherever you're headed toward that hey I'll still laughing [laughter]\nI uh I got to think if it if you guys have to have a\nMore pulled together in this latest [laughter] who looney bed Michael sorry I'm Sorry to ... and there it is we've been friends ever since\nEver since but that was the day April for two thousand and six when the dam broke no wonder you remember the exact date well is also on the date of the clip you know but I think you'd remember it anyway after all that but that there it is and that's before we ever even knew there was a national slap your irritating co worker today I think it was founded\nFor that reason yes and then this this might be a remote correspondence of the day right here and today we've gotten more remote correspondence than any day in the history of the show\nAnd I sincerely apologize I couldn't keep up again I have ADD which which helps you yeah I think and talk and run the board the same time but

what's on their mind to him and with their hearts how can you be offended\nMy goal is not to offend anyone my goal is to educate speaking of education I've got a great article this is a this is from industry week and it says reshoring is on the rise what it means for the trade debate\nIt says a two thousand and two thousand Eighteen data is in and it shows a surge in manufacturing jobs that are being ... short back to the U.S [noise] um this this is a job announcements were up fifty two per se\nUm this this is a job announcements were up fifty two percent I'm from uh from last year and a whopping two thousand eight hundred percent from two thousand and ten\nIt says announcements lead to hiring typically within six to twelve months now what does this mean sometimes when you read these articles it's kinda hard because they throw these statistic twenty a hundred percent for the two thousand percent when I was in ... percent you know what does this mean\nWhat this means is that companies are looking at their strategies\nThey're looking at their their total kind of tax payments and and and all all the other things that go along with with you know manufacturing with distribution and with sales because at the end of the day if you make gadgets and nobody buys them you got a problem or if you\nMake gadgets and they're too expensive nobody I buy them so to find that that ... that sweet spot where the gadgets are you know profitable enough that you can stay in business and do well but cheap enough that people you know as many people as possible can buy them\nWell President Trump and this article industry weeks as President Trump has announced tariffs on solar panels appliances deal woman I'm In a broad range of Chinese products\nHis aim is to eliminate the seven hundred billion dollar a year non petroleum goods a trade deficit vast increasing us manufacturing by about forty percent\nThat's five million jobs that's a whole lot of cotton picking jobs I'll tell you that um many observers question these ah actions based on likely retaliation and hire us consumer prices basically what they're saying is you know um these tariffs [noise]\nWhat they're going to do is just going to make things more expensive and it's not going to address anything oh oh I beg to differ I beg to differ\nTo address anything oh oh I beg to differ I beg to differ absolutely I beg to differ\nThe articles continues to say that we observe from our data and reshoring combined with other reshoring initiative reports that it is now clear ... important part by the way if you weren't listening listen now it is now clear\nThat us manufacturing including foreign owned plant can be started up are grown supportive substantial flow work back to the U.S\nUs in foreign companies increasing me recognize that it is in their interest to supply more of the U.S market by local production and sourcing\nBringing so many jobs from offshore this proves the weak claim that only four to Thirteen percent of the decline in manufacturing jobs has been due to off shoring\nWith the rest due to automation if so few jobs had been lost off shoring\nSo many could not have been recovered and just one year I mean that is incredible when you when a when you kind of adjust to what this article is saying and this is a trade magazine by the way this is a a magazine that specializes in um [noise]\nUh in in ... you know it's it's a if you have a manufacturing company you get this magazine um [noise] you know if you have a factory you get this magazine so this is like the magazine for for those kinds of people\nSo it's like if you're a dog person you probably got you know dog life or something [noise] um so these people get industry weak and and and they're saying\nThat it's obvious now that the claims that people have been making that oh you know the American American manufacturing has not been lost offshore and it's been lost to automation robots are taking over the jobs but this just proves that claim this proves\nThat it's been off shoring that it's been it's been killed\nThis proves that it's been off shoring that it's been it's been killing our industrial base\nI'm excited because again you know I I have nothing against other countries but I I just yesterday I bought a shirt from Bangladesh [laughter] I told my wife well at least it isn't Chinese and we're gonna have a Chinese up they later on so please stay tuned 'cause I got more about that [noise]\nBut I told her I'll buy it it's a nice shirt it's decent price I Will buy it because I wanted a flannel shirt I don't have any flannel shirts\nIt is important that that we use trade to find the best possible prices\nTo facilitate the exchange of goods\nFrom China to China we all know that this was a one way street this is to facilitate goods from China to the rest of the world it is also a way to counter the strategic check a choke points that\nWay to counter the strategic check a choke points that China has when it comes to um uh distributing there they're manufactured products when you look at China and you look at a map of China I should say\nYou come to the realization very quickly that they are a country with a lot of boundaries and a lot of borders and a lot of choke points\nIn the event of a war between China and the U.S on the Chinese notice very well in maritime blockade would be disastrous for them because there are no efficient\nOverland routes to get products and services in and out of China except for the sea\nAmerica's very blessed that we have friendly neighbors north and south for the most part\nAnd we've got two oceans to choose from in terms of delivering goods um and a whole bunch of ways to to get good delivered in essence what China's trying to do is have more options [noise]\nHere's the part where I have a big problem with the Chinese a belt silk belt or whatever the heck it's called the the one belt one road initiative\nThey are lending money to a third world countries and doing backhanded deals people are getting rich politicians are getting rich by signing these great big loans for three hundred million dollars for airports\nFor roads for railroads that there are countries simply do not need they default to the lender who happens to be China who then takes possession\nAnd so now the Chinese have possess\nWho then takes possession\nAnd so now the Chinese have possessions of deep water ports and tropical countries they have access and control of airports and by the way they also control the Panama Canal and guess what will happen when there is a war guess where we're not going to be able to go through yes you guessed it [noise]\nAnd so this this has become a tool by which the Chinese government and the Chinese government use their economic clout\nTo gain control over key infrastructure projects in third world countries so now because of this initiative these countries are stuck with mega projects that has been rich politicians\nAnd they're now under the control of the Chinese and so basically they not only pay for facilities but now they have ownership is well in other countries\nAnd of course these facilities are built with Chinese labor using Chinese materials Chinese technicians and it's maintained 'em by Chinese workers\nAnd so this is a way of gaining a the Chinese gaining inroads into these different countries and and there are many African countries that are getting to the point where they're they're starting to see kind of what's what's happening here [noise]\nUm [noise] there was a country just recently I have to look it up that just recently canceled a three hundred million dollar a Chinese investment that I had been announced and plant they decided that they're not going to go with it they don't think they need it and uh\nIt is um it's a redundant project and so they've canceled it in a Chinese are are are absolutely upset\nI Would be upset too if in in the interests of of improving my country I'm country X Y Z the Chinese offered to help me\nProving my country I'm country X Y Z the Chinese offered to help me build roads and I I agree I take out a loan to have these roads built their promises that I'm at my local workers are going to get the jobs\nI come to find out that it's only ten percent of the projects workers are going to be hired and they're going to be hired in the most menial of positions of transporting rocks or carrying real barrels\nBut all the lucrative jobs goes to the Chinese workers and the Chinese brings or bring a famous because he did it back kind of deal that allows their families to come and the Chinese families bringing they open up a restaurant let's say and they open up a store and the little by little the you've got a a a Chinatown and and your your basically your town\nAnd your infrastructure is slowly taken over by a foreign country this this to me I don't know I I [noise]\nThis worries me quite frankly people have to find a place to let people have to find a place that people should not be discriminated against us simply because they're Chinese and so I usually have a Chinese disclaimer and I'll say it now I have nothing against the Chinese people ... absolutely not I have nothing but great respect\nFor their five thousand years of culture and history um I understand I I'm a story and I understand the history of the Chinese people how\nTheir country was carved up by the western western powers if there are a little bit paranoid that there's a reason why you know they they are and I I understand that that said that does not justify their current actions\nOf of taking over huge territories in the south China Sea um militarized wing islands laying claim to to to Lance and and and territory that does not belong to them ever has I'm Sorry never has\nAnd we can argue that point as well if you're a Chinese destroying I'm happy\nIt has and we can argue that point as well if you're a Chinese destroying I'm happy to go toe to toe with you [noise]\nBut this initiative to spell it their own initiative worries me greatly because it is a way of strangling countries that are too weak or that don't have a fish and I'm an effective governments\nThat are subject to corruption and you know they they say power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely but the the lubricant of corruption is money and if you can provide money\nAnd instructions to look the other way a certain things take place don't worry it's for your own good it's going to be good and here's the next ten percent of the project for you and your family and so you got yours let others get there's\nThat kind of thinking is going to lead to the downfall on in my opinion of the the one belt one road project because people are gonna realize they're going to see it for what it is it is a Chinese government\nLand grab infrastructure grab a under the guise of of helping people\nWith all of the issues that we have um as a country with all of the trouble that we have um as a nation and with our history as well we strive to do the right thing at the end of the day at the very end even if it takes years\nAmericans eventually do the right thing after all options have been exhausted of course\nBut we still do the right thing and the question I have is is that the case for the Chinese government the answer is no there's a reason why the Chinese are fleeing their own country they are looking for a place where they can raise their children in peace\nWhere they can express themselves where they can have freedom of religion it is the Chinese government that is making trouble and unfortunately\nIt is the Chinese government that is making trouble and unfortunately if things continue the way they are they will also be their downfall because even if you do have one point three billion people compare two or three hundred and fifty plus million people\nThere's the question of will and Americans once they realize what they're up against\nThere comes a point just like me where they see no mas for an English no more we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\nHi my name is Chris Wyoming and I'm the manager of the elder

I'll blurted out [laughter] the Taco Bell [laughter]\nIt's just it's how I rolled\nHow do you build well how do you become wealthy\nYou know the strategy for choir ing accumulating wealth is actually pretty simple it's two words compound it interest you don't have to be a business owner to become wealthy you don't have to waste your money in lottery to become wealthy\nI Am one of those people who is not going to buy a lottery ticket\nAnd as a matter of fact I encourage my friends I was a church on Saturday and I told in front of the congregation I said I Hope no one here buy lottery tickets because you should rely on your own efforts to accumulate wealth and and have faith in God that God will provide for your needs\nThat's the story for another time [noise]\nCompound that interest what does that mean I'm going to share a very quick story there are three people Michael ... Michael he saved a thousand dollars per month from the time you turn twenty five until he turned thirty five\nThen he stopped saving but left his money in his investment account or continue to a crew at a seven percent rate until he retired at age sixty five so he only saved for ten years\nJennifer held off and didn't start saving until eight thirty five\nShe put away a thousand dollars per month from a thirtieth birthday until she turned forty five like Michael\nKnows per month from a thirtieth birthday until she turned forty five like Michael she left the balance in her investment account where it continue to a crew at a rate of seven percent until age thirty five\n\nSam didn't get around to investing until late forty five\nStill he invested a thousand dollars per month for ten years halting his savings that exist you five then he also let us money ride until the sixty fifth birthday [noise] Michael Jennifer and Sam each saved the same amount a hundred twenty thousand dollars over a ten year period\nSadly for Jennifer and even more so for Sam they're ending balances were dramatically different\nFrom Michael who started saving very early in his life like my daughter and her husband they are savers they saved ten percent of their income\nCombined um and I want to hear what they are but it's a it's a it's a pretty penny and they've been doing that since they started working they own their own home I mean there's a they have a mortgage\nBut they have savings as well and they I can I can honestly say that my my daughter and her husband are going to be wealthy when they retire [noise]\nMichael who saved a hundred twenty thousand twenty thousand dollars starting at age twenty five to thirty five and retire to sixty five\nHis ending balance was one million four hundred and forty four thousand nine hundred sixty nine dollars Jennifer who started ten years after Michael ended up with seven hundred and thirty four thousand for five hundred and forty nine\nNot too bad Sam\nUp with three hundred and Seventy three thousand four hundred and Seventy dollars the power of\nA hundred and Seventy three thousand four hundred and Seventy dollars\nThe power of compounding interest means that the same amount of money over time you'll did Michael almost a million and a half dollars more than ten times his initial investment\nBecause he started early and basically let interest or an interest\nCompound it interest it means that the money that you save and invest the interest that that money makes is reinvest it and so that interest earns you interest burns you interest and so on and so forth\nAnd so for those of you who are mathematically inclined a compound interest chart overtime looks like a logger ethnic chart alone most looks like a um [noise] the trajectory of a um a vote for Abdullah um again probably talking or saying things that people don't understand it looks like a\nAlmost like a rocket I'm a slanted rocket that takes off from the earth\nAt first it kinda travels along the ... you know the earth\nBut little by little it starts to gain altitude and as it gains altitude its trajectory becomes vertical so instead of skimming the ground it's going way up in the sky and that's that is your interest that's how much money you're making\nWith the you know with every rise with every year that that that Axios becomes more vertical I'm so those dollars you know are earning many many many many many more dollars I'm that's why it's so important to to have a four O. one K. if if you have a four one K. with your employer\nTo to maximize your money and and do it as early as possible um I Know when you're young you want to have all the best and latest toys I'm but these are the things that are just they may not bankrupt you but they're gonna they're not gonna help you to be wealthy um\nBut I just they may not bankrupt you but they're gonna they're not gonna help you to be wealthy um Forbes magazine says there are nine different ways to to build wealth\nUm obviously you need to have money to save money\nBut everybody can save a little bit of money even if you're making minimum wage you can still felt that way fifty dollars a month of your paycheck and just say I'm never going to touch that money that money goes away I'm In my mind and that's just there it's it's an locked box and thrown away the key until I'm sixty five at age sixty five or sixty seven sixty or whatever\nThat's what I'm going to open up that box\nBut I'm going to keep putting money into it um but ah what what he says is um [noise]\nWhat Forbes says is you know don't buy the the nicest slash his car by a car that reliable by a car that she used to always say bye used as if at all possible I'm and I'm that way you don't get stuck with a rapidly depreciating asset [noise]\nWhen you buy gold that asset sometimes you'll appreciate but it'll it'll hold its value that's the value of gold medal holds value in good times and bad [noise]\nIt'll appreciate in bad times at a hotel you in good times a car is probably the worst decision you can make in terms of money I mean if you got a lot of money and throw it away\nThen I guess instead of throwing it into the street you can just throw it into a car because\nThe moment you drive a car with a lot it's already lost twenty percent of its value right there\nAnd as you as the years go by that becomes a depreciating asset so that after a certain amount of time that car is worth ... little to nothing\nI purchased a used vehicle it's a Nissan Pathfinder two thoughts and love and great car really love it it's it's been so very reliable have had no issues with it I Love that car um I pay twenty thousand dollars for it or was used three years old [noise]\nWas three years old [noise] and um I've had it for several years now and I think the book value on that car is uh seven thousand dollar so basically I've lost sixty six percent [laughter] of value of the car [noise] um but I still have that card and it's the only car I happen to my family we had one car so we said money there [noise]\nMy middle son chose to defer his formal college education to a later date um he had two years of college and then went to trade school and computers is trade school education and now he's going to work in trade\nAnd he's mentioned that he would considering a bug to considering going back to college at a later date and to complete his bachelors because he would like to have a bachelor's degree I can understand that\nI'm fifty eight years old and I'm Still working on getting my masters um the joke and my family is is that um I Will get my masters in one hand and my retirement papers and the other and my response is so be it as long as I get 'em because I I I consider it valuable to have a masters\nIn my current stage in my career totally useless I'm having a master's it's not really helpful um but it's helpful for me and so these decisions you have to make it I mean I started college when I was twenty\nMe and so these decisions you have to make it I mean I started college when I was twenty four\nWay six years six seven years after most people decide to start college so it's never too late to get an education but an education is very important\nAnd an education doesn't have to be a four year college degree education can be like my son did a trade school him and his friend the friend is an electrician Brandon shot up to a brand and he's a electrician he went to school to become one and he's quite good and he's doing well financially ... while on his way he he he likes his craft\nHe does work on the side and I'm going to have a job for him hopefully next year to rewire my basement\nHopefully you'll give me a good deal um but there are other educational resources that can be had\n'em for a little too to know to know cost of one of the resources that I really like is can Khan Academy account economy is more for you might say for like high school students um it's it has\nI mean it has math science and engineering computing arts and humanities economics and finance I'm obviously test prep this is something that I mean my my son wanted to go to a very good school he wanted to go to Amherst um and he needed to have the best possible um SAT score\nNow I'm capital test prep does a fantastic job of preparing you for for um for the does the college SATs in GREs\nBut kind of economy had a free alternative\nSo we decided to try and because I Am a project manager this was before I started to work for ... I mean for Caplan 'em I said you know what let's try Khan Academy because I'm a project manager because this this will give you the tools that you need I can help you manage this this process\nThis this will give you the tools that you need I can help you manage this this process so that you can complete this course and it'll it'll help you and it sure did it it increased to score I now I forget the exact numbers but it was it was statistically significant um by him completing the Khan Academy course\nYou probably would have done better had he gone to to you know formal test prep I'm a service like Catholic\nBut he already was pretty smart he already had a decent score just needs to bump it up just a little bit and so that that ... that he had at uh economy helped him to get to that um to that next level but you know kind of kind of me I mean has courses in organic chemistry biology electrical engineering\nUm AP Physics chemistry computing I mean this is incredible and and it's and it's all free\n... H A n academy dot org and um [noise] that's just one one resource that's available there's also at ... there's a Yale open your courses [noise]\nDid you do that you could actually take all the classes that are required to obtain a degree from MIT and from Yale without having to go to MIT and Yale if you if you take the classes and uh take the tests that they that they have on line\nYou can get basically the the equivalent there's so much education that's being offered for for free or very little cost it's amazing I mean one of my certifications um that that I obtained [noise] I I put myself I'm I'm up in human resources I Am a I'm\nA senior professional human resources um professional ... through Sharm but I'm also a um [noise] um so it's a society for human resources\nUm so it's a society for human resources S H U R management I forget exactly it's the acronyms now but I'm a senior certified professionals from sugar\nAnd I'm a I'm a a senior professional human resources professional from um [noise] um the the other or a crediting organization\nIn order for me to obtain that that sort of a case in their colleges that offer courses desperate forces\nThey're expensive those Fifteen hundred bucks to take the course the test itself is four hundred dollars so you know and if you fail you got to take it again and it's another four hundred bucks I'm so being who I Am Mr frugal I did not want to blow four hundred bucks\nAt the same time I didn't have Fifteen hundred dollars to spend\nUm for these for these courses so I put myself on a program I of veiled myself or certain um online resources that were available available for free I purchased a book on Amazon a used book from Amazon dot com I got 'em used 'em a\nFlash cards of on E. bay and I basically cobble together an education program for myself took me about nine months and I still have the sheet with all the kind of the ... you know I I Am a project manager so I mean [laughter] if I if I Can't manage to myself what good am I [noise]\nMy total investment in order to obtain my certifications um was probably at the most I probably spent less than a hundred dollars and I think that's being probably generous it's probably more like sixty bucks for all of my educational materials\nI took the test and I got I averaged highest scores in the country this is a test\nI averaged highest scores in the country\nThis is a test that over half the people that ticket flunk it and then the other people for the half the people that flunk it when they take it they flunk it again\nSo statistically if you flunk this ... this test the first time you're gonna keep lumping it um unfortunately it's one of those those tests I got the highest scores because I I over studied I knew that that's that's what I needed to do in order to get the highest scores [noise]\nSo I guess what what am I say [laughter] I'm rambling again\nWhat I'm saying is that education especially in the twenty first century should not you should not use the lack of education as an excuse to not get ahead\nBecause there are so many resources available that are free or that that are extremely low cost\nAnother case in point um I achieved my um professional scrum um certification um and I took a course that ordinarily cost several hundred dollars I got a course of specialty on this course for I think it was ten dollars\nWould that ten dollar course I was able to leverage that into an additional certification like I mentioned earlier today I've got a bunch of alphabet after my name these are all sorts kitchens that I've that I've acquired and and they're valuable I I I Will tell you\nMy my shrimp certifications um was worse um a twenty five percent pay raise and I'm I'm not a slacker I'm making some pretty decent decent change\nIn my current job but I Would not have gotten to that point without that certification so\nDon't be shy take a risk and and explore educational opportunities because that's something that can never be taken away from you people can you can lose\nThat something that can never be taken away from you people can you can lose your money you can lose your house you can lose your car but you can never lose your education we'll be right back\nOn October thirtieth at six thirty PM the center for reconciliation will host the hidden history of the second amendment a presentation by Carl

it's unbelievable but we've got a good committee and um you know a lot of people who really have to hide in it and I was really surprised when we first heard that was going to be torn down of the outpouring of people in the community who said no no no you can't do that down to it all meant something to them when they were young\nWell I think that's it I mean if if it's something that's been visible to people during their lives and and they make that personal connection it makes it makes a whole different uh feel to it you know I'm so\nFeel to it yeah I'm so ... you're talking about the association being involved in you know working in a different projects are there are certain things that they're trying right now to preserve that uh you know all kinds of projects are they pursuing right at the moment\n[noise] uh well we've just open nomination for historic preservation awards [laughter] that's something we do every year and it's just to recognize people in the community who have done something to preserve adverse history whether it be a a building or\nA cemetery or you know could be anything um we say it's a person place or project and ah if anyone would like to nominate anybody that they felt did something very a\nMeaningful to preserve history within the last year or two um they can let me know and uh we'll put them on the list of possible nominations the what that given out until may may\nFeel it's always a good way of people becoming aware of interesting stuff I'm like some of the homes that you featured in past years than the ... really is a meet again the quality of the workman ship and ... some people have put in to preserving the historic nature of the problem is is really impressive\nYeah every year the young when we were talking about the society I should've mentioned every year we have a house to a historical house tour that first Saturday in June and we feature five or six houses that are um\nReally outstanding for one thing or another you know we the historically significant or architecturally significant and um it's usually you know a\nPeople are going to say it's any well attended the I'm what I've heard I haven't actually been on this one myself I've always heard that they should kind of John I should I I'm sure it'd be very interested in in a lot of that it's a and I'm sure it will take years and years before you run out of new properties the show because there were quite a few if any one didn't\nBefore you run out of new properties to show because there are quite a few\nIf anyone's interested if they've got a historical house and they want to put it on the house to our please give me a call also um\nThere are plenty of old houses in ... but um it doesn't seem as though people are that apt to allow us to use their houses as much as it used to be self sometimes it's tied getting houses but if anybody's interested give me a call\nAgain I mean that's exactly what we're here for the ... people know how how they can get involved in unity to help but you know to help\nHelp preserve because I mean we've all seen as you know as we drive around New England some communities that really have gone all out and trying to preserve a everything and anything that the that they can um [noise]\nI Know that we had a you know some issues in the past you remember when we were talking about uh what did we caught historical rode\nThe scenic wrote on Minnick wrote ordinance yeah that would that we batted around for years and years and years and years and I'm nodding off the council for for years as a as anything ever actually come of that as\nI Know we pretty well\nPut it aside let's say yeah I'm not sure whether it will come back or not but um it's just something that the Massachusetts historical commission suggested that local historical conditions use as a tool to preserve the history so that's why we want us to try and get it on the books but there's just no one murder out all the time no it doesn't\nAnd unfortunately as time goes on to become fewer and fewer roads that probably sort of meet the criteria that\nAre feeling through buildings we all we have to one of the things we strive for is to find new uses for old buildings and hear an Arab are we've really done a good job with that\nYou know there's a lot of buildings that have been a change totally from what they were originally to you know like the sweet house the first mass houses literacy center you know the fire station is the senior center\nWe house the first mass houses literacy sent you know the fire station is the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just these great new uses for old buildings that need to remain standing and be a Potter by heritage\nRight now and why not just like finding something to do with the building the good good positions and it's it's making good utilization delivers the Senate building gets so much so much youth and that's a gorgeous building it really it\nReally is and it's well built ... you know they don't build 'em like\nThey used to I think that's one of the kids are why a lot of these properties of survives over the years is that they really work so well built convince some of the stuff we see today yup\nMy house as strong as anything he'd go to bang bang a nail into those sound beams die ... and ... you've been to nail over\n[laughter] that's pretty good\nI I mentioned one of the difficulties people have when they said they they buy it all their property like that and they want to stay with the historical seem ... make it seem timely it must be difficult sometimes to get materials and stuff that match up with the time Ira especially when you get further back\nThere's lots of businesses out there now that really concentrate on that and and not you know pride themselves and being available with all of restoration materials that you need and especially now that you are on line getting everything doesn't matter where it is you can get it\n... well that's good to hear yeah oh yeah yeah so what other activities besides the historical commission of society what other stuff have you been involved in over the years I'm sure there's a lot of what I said\nI Belong to those two things but I also belong to DARE and we're very we're very very proud of our little pack house the Seventeen twenty three house on on the corner of Elizabeth and knocked me that's earlier than my house\nNow that that's basically it right across the ... yes it is for people want the snow you want to talk about what about what the deal\nTo where CBS yes it is for people want the snow you want to tell us a little bit what ... what's the ... some of the people out there might not be familiar with ...\nIs a national organization and Arab roast chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started here in Massachusetts back in Nineteen oh one and uh it has to do with your genealogy mostly you have to prove that you are related to and I are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary war and uh you you have to go through all of the genealogy to prove that and then this what this this group does themselves as we try to preserve patriotism and we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we try to um\nPraise the students who are into history and that type of thing uh but it's uh like I said it's a national organization\nThat's really written it and it's to chop the here's been since Nineteen all one yes it has well that's a that's a long well established younger an association yes and no did you get involved with that when you first moved to the community\nIs again it was when I was trying to attract the history of my house and so um\nThat that was one of the groups that I joined also but I'm also a member of the ... museum I oil paint I don't know if everybody knows that HUD and I I sell my paintings yet so I'm I Do oil paintings and um I can do them to order you've been anything all your life\nYou know I started hearing about the seventies and for ... the older folks that are watching this um maybe they remember either race I have a race was an art teacher here in ... I took from her for ten years so um and I did things like on adult beds and and uh all the local things summer school at ... high and two for the ap courses\nJoin it yeah and then I also belong to the triborough called that club\nOh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original members\nOh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original member of the clubs dotted forty years ago this ... this year coming and um we've got a Nineteen sixty two Corvette and we've had it for thirty eight years and we um\nBoth thought you know yeah thirty eight years and um we like to go out and ride around in it and we've got a lot of a good friends in the core that club and it's great fun still\nYou must get me a lot of people you know what about all those shows top people are good people that's great yeah that's where it's no there any uh activities and the community that you've thought about getting involved with it maybe haven't yet had the time or\nI think I've really between my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight grandchildren and one and a half great grandbabies wow so um that takes up you know\nA lot of time to you and uh yeah so I think I'm actually involved in enough things with or without any more snow\nAgain when you when you first moved out of ... and you interested in researching the history of your house um that led to getting involved in community activities but um I think today\nThere are a lot of people out there that I find it a little bit harder to get involved in the community there not quite you know the spill lifestyles with so much busier they work out of town um\nYou have a suggestion for people who are thinking about jihad us you know I'd like to get involved with something that\nKnow when you started to say that something went through my head and it was something that my chemistry teacher in high school said to me and I've never forgotten it you always find the time to do the things you really want to do [laughter]\nOkay so if somebody really wants to do it this so many things available in outer borough I mean there's a gym analogy club at the library that does the YMCA has all these programs the library has a whole bunch of programs and then all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um even even\nThen all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um even even when you've worked at the factories this I I actually belong to the ... for retirees to the gold like schools that's just because I worked out for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in outer borough and you know if somebody really wants to do what they find a way so\nOkay so you have any you know well is that people who", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Attleboro", "day": "23"}
