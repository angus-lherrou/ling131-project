mid\n... wants to take a moment Greeks are neighbors they hire somebody ever seen in a while maybe get to know someone's name you haven't met yet [noise]\n\nAll love superhero we live in a day and age when we want to have a narrow or what role ability and uh my definition of hero has changed over the year\nMy definition of hero has changed over the years\nI used to think David Was a hero because he flew the giant Goliath but now that I'm a little older I see the David really was a hero because he was willing to slay the darkness in his own heart\nThe lord has led me to speak on some fifty one and if you want to get your bibles out pretty much go versus diverse through that\nDavid uh was known as a man after God's own heart um and he's known as ... as a man after a God's on hard and it's kind of confusing why because on the one hand David Was an adult\nOr a murderer and was fraudulent but on the other hand he had a passion for God that caused him to even be called a man after God's own heart\nAnd according to the law of Moses he should have been taken out to the edges city and stoned to death for murder or for adultery\nUltimately he broke God's law his sin\nUltimately as the king was against God himself for not obeying the law himself\nVersus five and six say this but surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceive me\nSurely you desire truth in the inner part you teach me wisdom in the in most\nPlaces parents every one of your children just like every one of us as adults\nHas a sin nature of bent toward evil I Know they started out innocent but quickly they they learn we learn how to do wrong\nThere's something in us that is is bent towards evil David took responsibility for his actions he didn't blame his mother's father or his third grade teacher\nI did it was simple from an early age\nNow for six says that he knows the source of of evil and you'd teach you\nSurely use that dire truth in the inner part again that's that outer outer mass at public masking the inner truth\nAnd when that citizen exposed to David he calls that wisdom he's learning how evil his heart is\nI have a friend that leaves a very disciplined wife very disciplined and he I asked him why are you so crazy about how you discipline your life he says I'm afraid of what I Would become if I didn't discipline myself\nFriends our inner heart needs those boundaries David\nOur inner heart needs those boundaries David\nNew forgiveness versus seventh through nine says Clinton's me with his slipping I Will be clean washed me and I'll be wider than snow let me hear joy and glad and us let the bones you have crushed rejoice\nHide your face for my sins and blow out of all my inequity David Was praying like a priest in the Old Testament after satisfying the requirements of of purification the animal sacrifice\nThe priest would take his up I'm a little scraggly plants and dip it in in water and and and and symbolically sprinkle it on the individual\nIndicating that they were now pure now like I said his opposed to a small plan and we first read about it in the Bible where during the Passover they kill the Passover lamb and they dip his up in blood and put it on the door posts and above on mental\n\nJesus is the Passover lamb\nWithout the shutting a blood there is no forgiveness\nIs and I I Love I Love with the Isaiah prophesied about the purity that comes from Jesus no matter how deep the stain of your sins I can remove it ...\nI don't know I've got to work picture my mother down there in the basement she got the little plastic yellow cup and then the the blue one and they all have different functions to take out different scenes\nThe matter how deep the stain of your sins God can remove that I can make you as clean as freshly fall and snow even if you are stained as red as friends and I can make you as white as well\nFriends we can't go back and become innocent again we can't we can't go back to innocence but we can go back to purity and forgiveness\nIts its repentance its its crying out to God and David\nIt's repentance its its crying out to God\nAnd David cried out for two things that were possible to have restored joy and peace joy is one of the first signs of salvation remember the Ethiopian unit came up out of the water rejoicing piece follows a God's Grace just as surely as as a ... dawn follows night\nSince we have been made right in God's slide by faith we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our lord has done for us\nThere was an interesting wine in this this passage let the bones you of crushed rejoice\nThis was not an easy thing David a former\nShepherd in extreme cases there were a lamb's that wanted to run off and get hurt\nIn extreme cases the shepherd would actually breaks the legs of the little lambs to keep them from getting hurt or lamb's would have to stay close by the shepherd in the same\nWay sometimes God has to limit your potential in my potential so we will run off into perdition\nHe has to get a sense keep us close to him through circumstances and limitations\nAnd we spoke to rejoice because that's gone protecting us from ourselves first nine has two interesting word pictures let me reverse night again you hide your face for my sins and blood on all my inequity\nHiding your face for my sins it David is probably thinking back of adamant even remember how they tried to hide from God and and David is saying\nGod turn away and don't look on my soon you hide from me my my because it's so obvious friends when we stand before God the search light of his of his glory reveals\nStand before God the search light of his of his glory reveals everything about us trying to hide our goodness as ... as silly as Adam and Eve standing there with a fig leaf\nIt\nJust doesn't work it's very obvious to God and the phrase blot out my transgressions I'm\nIn the ancient they used to have some pious as paper they would take for pirates and make paper out of it and it was very difficult process in the ... virus actually it was very valuable\nAnd uh it's called the ... because they would write on it and maybe after a few years but we don't need that shopping list any more they would take that with piracy and they would wash it and then rewrite on it\nDavid is saying look I've written so many chapters of my life or evil\nWashington let it be rewritten again\nRewrite the chapters in stories of my life by your grace\nDavid looked ahead\nVersus ten through twelve he says creating me up your heart's oh God and renew a steadfast bureau within me David\nLong for pure heart he longed to finish while he was probably thinking of of how saw burned out midway through his wife\nAnd and had a horrible I'm failing with God David like hey I Want to finish well I Need you to sustain me to the end\nDo not cast me from your presents or take your Holy Spirit from me restored to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me\nFriends my premise today is that real heroes are honest and transparent before God\nReal man of God real women of God\nReal\nMan of God real women of God don't hide anything but deeply expos who they are to God and then God opens up space that can be filled by the Holy Spirit\nDavid story has a wonderful ending he was forgiven he was to you guys know what he was forgiven teen murder\nHe committed adultery and he ... he committed fraud he intended to deceive people in God's forgave him and so I'm thirty two weeks of this\n... blessing to see who's transgressions are forgiven who sends are covered bless it as the man who was in the lord has not count against them and who spirit has noticed seats\nI acknowledge my soon to you and did not cover up my iniquity I said I Will confess my transgressions to the lord and you for games the guilt of mice and\nI Would imagine that David Was forgiven things far greater than anyone in this room and yet\nHe was called a man after God's own hearts why\nNot because he was he went from shepherd the king not because he defeated the fill those things not because this loop the giants he was a man after God's own heart because he he recognized his own they own his the ugliness was sitting in his own heart and he radically repented\nAnd turn to God he had a passion for God himself\nReal hero stand before God and say okay what makes you sad today God\nProud and fraudulent men and women lead double wives and cover up there since ...\nAnd say to themselves hey I've done nothing wrong David to that story hasn't\nNothing wrong\nDavid to that story has a happy ending in another way he honored God's authority\nHe he actually respected the man who corrected him so much he named one of his children after him and these were the children born to him they're shamu al Shabaab Nathan and Solomon these four whereby baths ... daughter ...\nFriends\nIf we it's life goes so much better if we just learned to Smith the gods authority but isn't that amazing that David respected the man who confronted him that's a passion for God the story has another happy ending in the sense that David learn the richness of God's Grace\nThat we diminish in the

continuing in the book of James uh last week we\nSpend a little time in the first chapter of James and we say the bulk of giants was written\nBy the half brother of Jesus\nOr we say the half brother goes uh\nAnd share the same father ah we believe that Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit a swab or say half brother we believe James as a leader of the church uh wrote this book\nAs the leader of the church uh wrote this book\nTo a community of folks who are struggling\nThat was struggling with many things and one of the things that they were struggling with is how\nCan that treat one another how do they treat one another how can they relate to one another society has his own way of doing so\nI and James wanted to make sure that the folks don't bring in the bad habits of society and to that relationship with God and to the church and to their relationship with one another\nAnd society creates distinctions among people in society or create a situation where if you or well do you do if you have means then somehow people viewing you\nAre a little bit better than folks who don't have means folks who don't have a resource is they don't have class so that was the way that society\nA promoter itself but folks\nIn the church somehow we're continuing the same practice\nAnd James wrote this letter to encourage them to change their behavior\nAnd the book in chapter to the passage that were read there are few things that I Want to highlight before you the first thing is not every\nThing that we call faith is true Christian faith not everything that we call a belief in Jesus Christ is actually a true believer in Jesus Christ you recall all kinds of things what you want but it doesn't make it so\nIn Jesus Christ you recall all kinds of things what what but it doesn't make its not everything that we call faith is actually true face and the second point that I Want to highlight before you is that face\n\nTo face is always accompanied by action true face is always a company by actions another way of describing it is the use of the description\nAre members of that like a synagogue or members of that church\nAnd James have to tell them do not show favoritism suppose a man comes into your meeting\nWearing a goal rain and find clothes and the poor man and shabby clothes also comes and if you show special attention to the main worrying find clothes\nSay he's a good seat for you but said to the poor man you stay in their boss\nIt's a good seat for you but said to the poor man you stay in their ... on the floor by my feet how do you not discriminate again I have you not discriminate among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts\nJames as when someone who is rich or perceived to be rich because not always the case\nSomeone who received all be rich won't enter your company walking through your environment walking through your your school walk into your place of\nA ... ... the place that's important to you what's your reaction to that point and when someone else who ... whom you're perceived to be poor and are down ... condition\nWhat's your reaction\nJim says if you\nGive the proper place the favorite place to someone or power someone of clout and then the poor person\nYou basically ignored and says hey sit here on the floor have you not discriminated\n\nThe folks could not believe it but James told them that will get this way of living and society\nThey may accept that way but I'd believers we should no longer do favoritism to any group of folks a particularly uh give ... to those who are rich I supposed to do\nClearly a gift favoritism to those who are rich I suppose to those who are poor\n\nAnd James go on to describe why we shouldn't do that it says less in my dear brothers\nHas not God chosen those who are poor and the odds of the world to be poor\nOr to be rich and faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him but you have insulted the pool\n\nIs it not the rich ... or they're not the one was dragging you went to court or is it not the ones who are slandering ... name of him to whom you belong\nJames is saying\nThe people who are well to do that you admired that you're looking up to that you would give favoritism too and Jim says\nAll out that the one who actually exploiting you\nOn that the one who actually you know uh doing you know things that are not in your favor why are you ignoring folks that you share a lot more in common with\nIn favor of the the rich and the well to do when in reality a ... they're the ones who are Robin Robin you and depriving you of what you need\nFirst eight is that\nIf you really keep the oil law found and scripture that royal law is\nNothing other than the commandments of Jesus is love your neighbor as yourself\nYou were doing right but if you show favoritism\nYou were doing right but if you show favoritism you send\nIn a convicted by the law as a law break\nPerhaps a\nMoney all the signs of money might not be what moves you it might be something else that you deem\nImportant maybe with a kind of person who look up to somebody who uh who was gifted with eloquence\nA and those who don't quite have it they don't get the same treatment from maybe ... are you uh you move to watch someone who who who's gifted with ah\nThe gift of a to be a great athlete right\nAnd it moves you when you are around that person you know you will run and have him or her sign\nSign your uh your T shirt or your book but someone else who was a nobody gets very little attention\nMaybe it's not athleticism that moves you maybe is the fact that okay uh you impress with where certain people had had gone to school\nAnd then when you hear that like wow and but someone else who didn't go to a place like that you ignore\nWhat James was saying as discrimination showing favoritism uh it's hard to not have it unless you continue to work hard at it continue to work\nAnd have it unless you continue to work hard at it continue to work hard and find out what what are the things that you are prone to one of the things that are you more likely to pay attention to\nAnd ignore maybe a\nThere's a certain group of people that you we have a tendency to ah and we called them you know our our law right and uh friends in our partners when you hear a they just had a a disaster you want to move in give everything you have to rescue them\n\nAnd the same way when there are others that you're in you don't necessarily care for because we don't share the same cultural background the same ethnic background when you hear a disaster happened to that place like oh whatever\n\nBut the same effort that would be needed or to help them being rescued and and\nUh you kind of ignore it James ... as much as you may not say you don't show favoritism but it is a form of favorites is\nSo ah\nIt's important to reflect on one of the things that are really moved us that are in society you know this is how they categorize himself this is how the the the the the treat one another\nOr maybe\nIn society when the boss shows up\nYou know\nYou see all the right things to the boss but a you imagine you know and certain industries for certain people or they'll be in the best behave\nIndustries for certain people uh they'll be in the best behavior right when the doctor shows up\n\nBut let it be the person who's cleaning the room\nAll of a sudden the same person who is really really cordial and you know to the doctor or to certain professionals when is the person who claimed the room the almost the and feed them\nJames says that's wrong that's wrong society may do it but I Believe it's we cannot do that\n\nAnd he says what good is it is for men claimed to have faith but has no deed such faith saver\nSuppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food if one of you say to him go I Wish you well keep warm in well fed but there's ... there's nothing about his physical needs what good is it\n\nChanges it is basically saying that in mind since you imagine a and sums on religious people good for that\nYou know have you ... ... and\nGenerally speaking whenever somebody here there's something bad happening in your life or in some buddies live is oh um oh I'm Sorry I pray for you\nThat's a great beginning and sometimes that's all you could do\nBut sometimes people say stuff like that but they make no intention on the things that they could resolve help you resolve so they they just completely ignore you but they said oh I pray for you Jim said the magic and someone comes in\nTook me ignore you but they said oh I pray for you Jim says he imagined someone comes and\nYou see them without clothes you know they're hungry it's a good thing to say you pray for them praying that the lord will do for them what you cannot do what the clothes you're going to help them get some clothes\n\n\nAnd then the second time doing on those ... to ...\nAnd\nYou look back on her\nAll

Denison and you know at at the beginning of the program we touched a little bit about\nHow you know sometimes just because we we come uh come to Christ or come in the crazed from that it uh you know it just simply make such different you know\nIt uh you know it just simply makes us different you know and but we still have our struggles\nYou know it's just one of them things so I just wanted to um to let you know that just because you know you become a fall of Christ doesn't mean that all of a sudden now you're perfect person\nBy all stretching the means no way shape or form a lead perfect and um that's why we need Jesus that's why we need a savior because um you\nKnow we just we just can't do it on our own made our own power and Romans aid does talk about the fact that you know that and you know what there's not one perfect person not one I mean as soon as we start getting into our our flesh and thinking that in our ego and thinking that it's all about us then that it it gets to be really ugly\nJessie the plan is um or brother Jessie as some people call them [noise]\nUm is a [noise] a preacher out of Louisiana he's a pretty big a television uh evangelist and well known and every now and then he likes to talk about um he his struggles now you would think that you know being a preacher\nAnd in past during a large church and maybe having a television minister you'd think that you would you know you probably have it all\nFully together right or wrong I don't think they don't change just because you're you're ... your ... treated pastor is you know pass during the church that they could have it all together I mean they get their struggles to\nAnd this is a perfect example and he always likes to point out his flaws in his examples now and then they show us [noise] um [noise] some of the things that he goes through\nSo I just wanted to take a moment and let's share a segment from one of Jesse the plant is his sermons um this this is actually it's kind of funny the way he tells the sermon too about his humanity for his humility of humanity and he admits that sometimes you know you never know when you're going to have a ...\nOf humanity and he admits that sometimes you know you never know when you're going to have a ... or ... how does the word it or ... or chronology\nAnd it's usually usually it's it happens\nRight when you're in front of somebody that you're you're or or you've been with somebody that you're trying to bring the Christ a witness to and you're not being a perfect example of Christ there's so many times I Know in my life that I'm not always a perfect example of of of Jesus or I'm not the perfect thing bastard or of Christ\nI think we all are guilty of that those that are already you know there are those that are Christians\nBut you know lots of some of the cycles had their flaws too so um\nThis is this is just to say you know a lot of folks say well gee you know those perfect Christians are not perfect\nWere just up people who are um you know we're we're ... we're we're learning we're growing we're constantly on the potter's wheel anyway take a listen and I bet you're going to get a ... or two out of this I'm from Jessie the plan is ministries\nI honestly the lord wanted me to buy this home so I bought this nine hundred and ten foot square how\nAnd I shouldn't have bought it\nBecause I remember when I put my hand on the door and I remember\nAbout thirty five year old just came out what\n\nOne of the\nAll the ... the\n... and then\nWell no way\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat was so painful then junior ... you'd slip ups for his role maybe ... you\n\nKnow I Know we'll let you know ... and all of a job she oh can\n\nYou hold on [noise]\nBy hand [noise] do you [noise]\nKids do\nKnow [noise]\nAnd\nThe first ... from a day like today album and then they're numbered title number one track with brand new day here on hot rock radio what what we're going to do right now is we're going to take some time\nIf you're a station that would like to take the radio show and the content that we are creating provide you can do show by contacting us shit hard rock male Haiti A R T hard rock male\n...

like to say I'm about to take time and say hello to ah to Greg out there how are you doing this morning Greg\nMike him you know I think the two really good time because the information sharing you know I think it's why I don't know and very very important for many people\nYou know it's funny Greg I'm One of the themes of the show today was based on what's going on in my life and about structures to we have to we we have to all abide by the there's a purpose for structures imagine a world if we had a world without structure\nMike when I didn't have structure in my life and plant\nLife feel completely apart because the choices I was making\nSure it seems to me when I Do support structure back in my life and building that foundation it seems like not only did the life come back together but stretches of the world seem like they slowly started to disappear\nNow uh it's funny to or in the beginning of the show I mentioned that you know just because I Will see a lot of times the world I think looks at people who become Christian differently to almost\nWe'll see a lot of times the world I think looks at people who become Christian differently it's almost like they look at you would have bigger magnifying glass like you can't do anything wrong you know kind of thing\nBut you know Christians and even pastors they're they're human too they can you know what we showed that and brother in the clip by brother Jessie you know how\nThe judge he admitted it one time and one of his sermons that he has issues with are dealing with anger at moments when he's trying to bring people to show them the love of Jesus and how God's working through that\nYoung to better him to become better at a reaching out to people or being a better example\nAnd you know it's funny the other day I um [noise] I had I guess his brother Jessie would say come malady but one of the things that I noticed\nIn my walk this morning 'cause I took a two hour\nWalk Greg and while I was walking I was saying you know sometimes we have to look at the not so much with the people are doing are saying or what's going on around us on the outside\nBut we still have the ultimate control was on in how we react on the inside and if we're so chaotic on the inside and were scatter brained so to speak in other words it for under a lot of stress on the inside then we can't respond in a God like are are friendly manner on the outside\nThat's very interesting because what I'm starting to understand\nThe world only a reflection of mine [noise] and so the more the more that I experienced different experience [laughter]\nSo you're saying the same thing with the\nPerson that long ago when there because the front of us she would get up you know just very\nHold out in front of a she would get all riled up and you know just very very upset twice shared with her next time when that happens instead of putting it rained or or your energy towards that other person\nTo observe it and just wish him a good day or something in my mind do you know when she died at doing that she had less and less people cutting in front of her\nWow that and I apologize for interrupting you that Greg but I think what you were trying to say to was that you know sometimes like for example what in the situation that I experienced yesterday\nEven though those people really didn't do that to me I did it to myself but because of the confusion was inside me and all the turmoil is going on inside me it manifested in outside of me\nHey Mike I'm really starting to ah think there's a lot of truth to that so instead of looking at what people are doing to us we really should look at how we're reacting to the situation in our life\nSo maybe there's a lesson in it for you to\nOf course there is I think the one I'm learning my people show up and I live really not to hurt us but how to help us to hit those next spiritual level even if it's a really tough experience it's\nAlmost like when we look at it and we when we could release it and when you don't get to mostly attached to that experience\nThen all of a sudden I think we're we're almost exalted to another level\nThat well that's pretty cool\nSee I didn't look at it that way you see when I was going through the experience I was looking at it that way and I'm really you know that it all falls into the structures we need to be at a point where\nReally you know that it all falls into the structures we need to be at a point where uh I guess you could say I need to be because I Know when we talk about this before on radio it's not about we it's about\nThe person actually speaking their experience\nMuck I agree with that because the only person that I really have control over as far as how I perceive my world outside of me is me\n... that's the only person that I can really control and if I Try to control another I think that's a good old days you have to fix or notes instead of myself\nAnd that's not operating and humility\nIn my opinion I'm starting to I don't think so and again I'm not preaching it because there's so many flaws that I have\nTo look and will continue to look at\nWhat the more I understand the outer world is really only a reflection of my own fears and the feeling that has to be but hailing associated with those beers isn't outside of me and me and that's how I think a\nJesus wanted a teacher remembered that scripture when it stayed in my pick the log on to my eyes so I can see the spec in my neighbors are\nUm actually it was saying why are you looking at the log in your own or why are you looking at the ... when you have a log in your own I Love that\nThat's a lesson and humility in and of itself so what so busy focusing on like for example me yesterday I was so busy focusing on just the event and the people around me I wasn't looking at the problem the problem wasn't them all the events that happened yesterday the problem was within Michael\nAnd do you know ... maybe what you're saying is that's why Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is within us\nAnd that's why she's in the kingdom of heaven and within right once we start feeling the kingdom inside of me\nAnd the perception of the world that I Want changes\nYeah and and it changes through the change within you the renewing of your mind\nJust want to congratulate you on your walking awesome awesome show\nYeah well thank you and uh you know Greg we're glad that you're part of a you're part of it even when you're not on the show you're still a a pot of its spiritually", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Attleboro",
