probably a center a mess to clean it today or tomorrow to find out what day she can actually come in as you know she was here\nA couple of weeks ago she was on the road show on a Saturday morning as well\nRight now we do have Jim Korean standing by once again with the latest updates on our forecast gym\nWell Dominic late season humid strep throat coming up we're getting today humid and also\nAccompanied by fairly warm temperatures for this time of the year starting out cloudy some areas of fog no rain around with any consequences though at just the kind of a damp feel out they were going to eventually get into the low in mid seventies this afternoon so yeah throw back this summer a little bit today wins out of the southwest\nSeven to Seventeen miles an hour as is usually the case it will be breezy us this afternoon once again like a last night will have areas of fog form otherwise mostly cloudy tonight but staying dry only falling back to the mid sixties and then tomorrow cloudy early like today but unlike today the sun will come out earlier\nAnd that'll send temperatures in the upper seventies still as we were thinking late last week or a possibility of a few eighty degree readings tomorrow how 'bout that eight degrees on the tenth of October\nHas been happening in the past but doesn't happen too often wins out of the southwest staying in the middle and upper sixties tomorrow night and then we get into the showers\nOn Thursday especially in the afternoon some downpours by Thursday night looks like it'll be two batches generally Thursday Afternoon a bit of allowing some portion Thursday evening and then late Thursday night into early friday that would be from the front and the closer approach of\nA ... at that time still maybe tropical storm a Mike\nAnd the closer approach of a ... at that time still maybe tropical storm a Michael which again ah with all eyes will continue to monitor it's still a few days out the track will determine whether if we get into any wind from it\nRight now the odds are we won't but just mainly the rain and then friday as I've been saying early in the day showers and then dry a cooler in the afternoon falling back to the sixties and right now Saturday and Sunday look nice and fall like as you would expect from that that time mid October\nUh mid fifties for her eyes on Saturday that could set the stage for once again yet another coolest of the season so far as we continue to go into this month of course every few days you start to get into the coldest in a while and we could be done around forty once again Sunday Morning and then back to the upper fifties Sunday afternoon so right now\nIndications are yet again a a good news for outdoor activities for this upcoming weekend I Know it's still only Tuesday Morning but I'm fairly confident the weekend is going to be dry but we're going to have to get through what's going on\nTo ourselves and this plant which will clear thing about some indications that early next week we'll have another round of showers with a front that could be around a Monday sunset today six protein and we just had a well in the next few minutes the official sunrise six fifty yeah we're getting into these late\nSunrise is until we set the clocks back in a few weeks so again we talked about this last week as well these dark mornings I'm this is one of them as a the kids go to school again not particularly the cloud cover because it is going to thin out\nA into some some this afternoon but this is the period now until we said the clocks back when it's cloudy in the morning it'll be noticeable because of the late sun rises again sunrise still a few minutes away six fifty high tide coming around eight o'clock and it's interesting to note one year ago today\nA we had what used to be hurricane Nate you might remember that one almost the same track\nWe had what used to be hurricane Nate you might remember that one almost the same track as a this one Michael and it makes sense because I said this to you done many times as you know the area down there in the Yucatan and the western Caribbean this is the time of year that when they get most of their storms\nNow make formed a deer hunt or south of Honduras Nicaragua and even Costa Rica and caused floods there went up to the channel they are just off of Yucatan and Cuba and then slammed once again Biloxi, Mississippi again this was all a year ago and just say well why am I really bring it up well we got the remains of that\nToday one year ago October night now wasn't a huge amount of rain I measured for tens of an inch but exactly a year ago today we got the remains of neat\nUh the hurricane and of course this year ah we're dealing with Michael almost exactly a year later which will some of the remains of that will get us on Thursday so almost a year to the date\nOf these two storms that came a almost the same track or going right through the channels there between Mexico and Cuba now it's in the Gulf of Mexico so kind of interesting to note that one of course the next\nName storm in the Atlantic would be ... dean\nIt was neat last year ... and I bring that up because there are indications are there could be another one in the next week that may form somewhere down in the Gulf or in the Caribbean so this was sort of the Caribbean time of year to get these storms one of our models\nYet again that whatever happens with Michael the next couple of days that will be gone by the weekend but some of our models were indicating some action late next week\nOr that might threaten the United states again so again\nAnd it makes sense because as I've been saying everything is delayed this year including the foliage so is this is my prediction for the rest of the year the hurricane season delayed because everything is still too warm to really quieted down so what surprised me to see\nAn or maybe even the old storm Oscar or the awards with Oscar who knows a little joke thing has always but\nUm Oscar or the awards with Oscar who knows a little joke thing is always but uh the tropical season or is not dead yet and we will get a taste of it Thursday Afternoon and especially Thursday night\nWhere we uh you know why it's hopefully we'll get to it by you know it's very still early still early and we may get a few more before the season ends\nIn the next long whether I'll have my thoughts of when I think we could have our first frost which is a eventually going to have to happen obviously but ah\nLast year it was about average right around this just a few days ago last year we had temperatures in the thirties some areas had frost and then the real frost kicked in about mid October bought the fifteenth so ah we're not going to see that the through the fifteenth so it is the late what else was new but eventually uh it is I'm\nGoing to happen by the way down a hill a Jay's been mentioning\nFor daddy five is backed up and I can hear on the scanners over forty five minutes ago with truck a large truck guy hit the bridge there one forty\n\nA.

course a alongside a truly hall who is now stepped down now Julie is going to be running alongside the gym for the November\nSixth election and Jim Hawkins now let me just make sure I have these microphones ready to go here uh\nI don't see as far as they got to make sure I have only every only like six microphones it takes to make sure that they're on correctly a good morning Jim warnings are ready for inviting me once again oh my pleasure my pleasure or as you said to me it's a few moments ago I asked you how things were going\nBusy guy yes big guy yes can't take this uh granted no not at all that campaigning everyday mhm [noise] um if a lot of people don't know who you are you as I said you've been a our state representative now for about six seven months there about\nA tell us a little uh be brief background uh I Know that your your former educated here in the city of out of our as\nWell yes I retired from out of our high school like tenth grade math and senior elective for financial literacy ... uh when I retired I worked for the Teachers Association is that what they call the Senate district coordinator so I worked with all the local state rep since ...\nWhat they call the Senate district coordinator so I worked with all the local state rep since and sent and senators in my district or which is kind of how I went into this people didn't know me in politics but I had experience at the state level working with legislation and with the people in our our area ... if I had an idea what I was getting into\nYeah um and as you know as you said last time you were here you know you you went through the the school system here at you you're taught at the schools as well um and now\nAs you got into the election this past year it's a it's kind of been a world when you've been you've been all over the place I mean you've been speaking I saw you are at a a chamber event show a little over a week ago and uh and it just doesn't stop\n[noise] it's it's actually it's the good part of the job I I went up based because I was a teacher and because I was working for the Teachers Association hoping to do good things for public education and I did that I'm chairman of the subcommittee on education\nAnd we overrode the veto to keep it so it's it's ... it's gone I'm very proud of that ah I'm proud in the progressive\nIf it's so it's it's ... it's gone I'm very proud of that [noise] uh I'm proud in the progressive caucus that they made me a guy chairman of the subcommittee on education but they valued my my words mhm uh an M I'm proud of the ... bill we passed a lot of things that I did an education ah\nAnd in terms of taking advantage in the budget I was happy to get fifty thousand dollars for the Arab or firefighters for health and wellness equipment or they deal with a lot of carcinogens and a poisons when they're breathing and smoke and and it depends on what burning in the building that they're going into\nAnd research shows that when they come back if they exercise first thing they can expel some of those uh but the exercise equipment is not ever ever a priority in the budget so this highlights that it's been years that that's been neglected\nOr in terms of the opioids the clinic that I'm coming on I promised that in my campaign and and I took on meeting with with a representative garlic and a lot of other experts to learn about that and I'm just blown away by that and I decided they give you one made in speech\nWhen everybody actually listens and puts their cell phones away the speaker speaker of the house is there a and it it it you are one chance to make a punch and I decided that was the most important thing I could do that was the biggest\nCrisis going on in our city so I use my maiden speech for that and if the bill did pass overwhelmingly and I'm hopefully going to be involved in the next version that takes it to the next step it was a very good bill so I'm very proud of all of those things\nAnd being I'm at the state house and I'm here locally or when you're not in the Boston area [noise] you've as I said you've been a at different places you've been you're actually going to be doing some uh some work as you mentioned the last time you were here at the Washington senior center as well I did we had a seminar there\nAre brought out a Denise Gregoire who's the chair of the joint house and Senate\nI brought out a Denise Gregoire who's the chair of the joint house and Senate committee an elder up here to talk about some of the legislation they've just passed some of the legislation is working on with all the time has been different issues I talked about some of the uh real is that real estate tax relief\nLegislation that I'm working on in the next session\nA it was very well attended and\nWe have to take care of our seniors they're the most vulnerable ... uh in our population down a fixed income and a lot of things happen in terms of health care and housing expenses that are are very challenging I also did a week ago a tour of a beekeeping facility on their farm road\nUh we we desperately need to pass the legislation I brought out representative Carolyn ... who wrote the pollinators bail 'em to to talk about that and highlight the need a third of our food comes from crops that are pollinated by bees and the bees are just dying off in some of it has to do with the chemicals that we're using\nIt doesn't ban these chemicals but it restricts they use them to the to a non lethal dose\nAnd of course I'm also of the other community event that I'm working on next week is is the opioid ... simpler and we just talked about yeah\nI'm a little bit um a beyond your your career as well\nUm you've ah as I said I've seen some pictures on social media and other things um you're a runner as well uh but do you have also done or some other things out there that you're very proud of uh the trial or the yeah the the Ironman Triathlon as well\nI've finished twelve of those yeah that's a two and a half mile swim hundred and twelve my bicycle and at twenty six mile run like a marathon it is a marathon that like a marathon at the end or I started when I was forty I got cancer I quit when I was forty five I felt sorry for myself\nI started when I was forty I got cancer I quit when I was forty five I felt sorry for myself I started again when I was fifty\nI got hit by a car when I was fifty nine I got bright sided by a car I couldn't run so I stopped that's when I got my NASCAR license and I raised ... ah then when I retired I couldn't afford to keep doing that on a fixed income\nSo back to doing the Iron Man uh I'm doing it at Lake Placid a finish twelve of them I finished Fifteen marathons twelve iron man's on next year I differed my entry for this year because I'm busy campaigning\nBut next year I'm entered in the I'm In Lake Placid there'll be in the seventies Seventy four age group\n[noise] how how does it feel any to ah to go around that track it's ... I haven't been there in a long time but uh it must be a thrill I'll have to\nTake you some idea of the season's over now yeah but I think one special rate\nUh [noise] I'm\nI raised the trucks which is more or less an entry level division for the Saturday nights ah we do Fifteen second labs are fourteen point eight which puts that's a little over eighty miles an hour except which doesn't sound so fast except there is no straight away it's an X shaped course you're always turning left\nSo if you can imagine going around an exit ramp at eighty miles an hour you know the next to you [noise] that's what it's like so much fun so much fun\nYou know years ago we used to go as a family uh and there was one gentleman from Upton mass George summer Oh yes remember that now yeah somebody out in mass\nAnd he would like every every every Saturday Night he would be like getting that checkered flag and yeah I think the most thing that we actually went to see was the uh the demolition derby the ... and the street division cars where they would go on and especially if there was a little water on the track [laughter]\nThey you know they ... twirling around because those ... it was they were regular cars or they weren't they weren't used to that that old track\nScare me they don't have the safety equipment no trucks we've got a role for ...\nWill track those scare me they don't have the safety equipment no and and trucks we've had a role for roll cage triangulate it for buyers eight bars next to us a full containment seed head and neck restraint are a lot of safety had it in it so if you do tango somehow you're not going to get hurt and those I they don't have that yeah\nI mean you looking at all those ah you know those those are those features of there including the demolition derby which you know after a while that smoked ... just keeps going up and going up and like I say\nBut it's a it's a fun thing and it's nice to see things like that have not died out you know be of families it's a family event\nIt is easy parking it's it's I I I go into the pits but I think it's only Fifteen dollars for admission for live entertainment that's a it's a deal\nIt really is um [noise] the uh now other than things like that or that you've done in the past\nI'm I'm if you if you have a day off you know if that's kind of it's kind of rare for for politicians out there [noise]\nUm what do you like to do I you know are there to be besides running and you know stuff like that what else do you like to do when you know when when you say your when you don't have the suit and tie on and stuff like that what's what's going on\nWhile I Do have this very cute little rescue time I heard yeah she's in her name is Audrey and she's a pot cakes rescue ... the ... come from the ... interacts islands when they're over populated there they're born in the wild they're feral dogs and most of the local people think they're a nuisance\nBut some of the local people that actually likes them\nFeed them the bottom of the local bowl of rice and beans which is called plot kicks so they called the dog's pot cake so now I got Audrey when my cocker spaniel who is Eighteen and blind and deaf was I felt that she was depressed because she didn't know she was my constant sidekick and she didn't know where I was in the house she did her and I come home\nShe was my constant sidekick and she didn't know where I was in the house she did her and I'll come home or in somebody suggested that another dog could communicated with her she would know where the other dog was in the hot cakes known for being submissive I had had to be a rescue dog and uh you can get a puppy too\nSo like I got Audrey and the two of them are inseparable it really was good for the golden years is that yeah definitely spaniel\n[noise] you know I think a lot of people say now I had a dog most of my life and ours we had to put down last year because he was actually a\nA a going blind so he had a we had a ... noodle yet as I said before a he was eleven years old and you know they don't live as long as other dogs so they're\nAll ... to my wife and I were talking a few months ago a you know maybe at some point you know as we get into next year we'll probably get another one uh but yeah it's it's amazing how\nThey they do become part of the family I mean I've had one for years or ... you know growing up and they do become part of the family even if you have a rescue dog it's becomes part of it's almost like you're a little baby there\nYep I Can't imagine not have I've I've never not had a ...

though on Saturday So again we've got some rain but not until Thursday Afternoon\nOkay sounds good and will catch back in the morning okay All right a representative Jim Hawkins in Studio with us this morning\nI'm you know um she's talking about your you know kind of a a whirlwind thing off the last seven months or so or with it in the legislature\nBut there are a couple of other items that you want to talk about as well um you know and it never stops especially a with construction here in the out of our area with new ... new businesses buildings and especially with uh the roads as well\nYes ah my involvement with that is the funding for that uh I talked to my Tyler and one of the issues that the city has is they get the funding after the budget has been passed which in this case was the end of July and then it goes through a process before the funds are actually available\nUntil like the middle of August and all of a sudden ... and that they want to do citywide they've got a very short window before the season ends to do it right in every community in the state is in the same situation so however many hating vendors there that can do that ... that there\nIs read out this like three hundred and fifty communities in this in the state that are all looking so the uh the supply of\nAnd this for three hundred and fifty communities in this in the state that are all looking so the uh the supply of people to do it a short\nWhich really puts them in a squeeze a some of the legislation that's been pending\nThat I wasn't involved in because I kind of learned about this in August when we were an informal session a would make the funding spread out over three years so maybe they could actually start on this work to it at a more instead of doing every street in the city at once they could do one at a time like a way to get the vendor do it quickly to more efficiently\nA start when the weather breaks in the in the springtime and spread it around with a whole season's that at the last few weeks of the season um\nWhen I go back in ... if I'm reelected when I go back in January that's definitely one of their priorities I Want to look at I Want to see there is there is pending legislation to change that and I I don't know what the pushback is I don't know why why we can't move on that particularly in the case of road paid in ... that would make it a lot smoother for the city\nA lot of um a lot of talk about that I've I've heard in the past few months is um [noise]\nUh even even before a mayor Paul roe was here as the as the mayor when a Kevin doom is was was our mayor\nTalking about uh the city scrapes around the area I mean the\nThe city the city is is actually looking really nice yes it is it really is a there's a lot of new things that may be coming a little bit a kind of slow right now I'm Down with a renaissance station is and then\nHopefully if all goes well I'm ... whatever whatever happens or with the New England sports village I Know that they they were on hold for a while and hopefully things will get back on track uh hopefully down the line\nYep I I went to a hockey game there Saturday Night was the team had a booth at the farmer's market okay right at me to go watch hockey but forget that these things are right here in the city is really really um special things we forget yeah this is Adam ...\nReally a special thing we forget yeah this out of us are really really cool city\nAnd you know the funny thing about that I was talking to some uh some young people that are in my neighborhood or in the in the vicinity uh during the ah the very hot weather we've had this year or they were looking forward to uh\nBe at the at the sports village because it was the coolest section of the city of our borough playing hockey or on the ice there as well so it was a nice a nice change\nI was just there for a ribbon cutting for the new physical therapy office that opened up as well that's I mean it it's taking time of course yeah it's a huge undertaking but that's going to be a really a good thing for the city's gonna open up a lot of possibilities\nAnd that what they've been talking about that I have sons of the original plans a few years ago uh with um you know with the architects\nUh down the line that street should be going down all the way down to county streets I guess I mean we're looking at the back end of the of the building on a on Congress way\nAnd you know with the er and I tell you one thing what's been very very very popular there um is the\nBond the restaurant and oh yeah there yes it's been on a fan of gourmet already a couple of times people don't realize you know here there's a restaurant in there and then he don't watch the hockey game while you're exactly you can get right there watching the kids or whoever you know\nBut I think it's it's really getting mood is good to it really is yeah steak tips to throw a delicious but ... but you know you don't realize this uh I think there's a yogurt bar in there as well in the Dunkin' Donuts and\nUh he's got the ... the skating or the or they can uh shopping the skates and stuff like that yeah it really is I mean when they started putting this thing together a few years ago people didn't have the idea of like wow it's going to be this and then talking about um you know\nTo go people didn't have the idea of like wow it's going to be this and then talking about um you know the whole down the line and aquatic center hotels and he had tons of jobs if they're still a lot of potential there is easy access of the highlights it's really perfect yeah originally I Know that we talk they talked about that a few years ago\nIs possibly putting a um an exit ramp someplace off of a highway down to them so that I think\nWhere they would put that may be down where that solar farm is a down where ... where Johnson's is in that area as you see off the highway because difficult but some of the I I I haven't heard anything else from the state on that one though I I have not either now [noise]\nUm [noise] as you as you go around ... or you go around the the city and the state now or if the state house um as I said you worked with a lot a lot of people out there if you do get reelected um which you're hoping you well yeah um\nAre there new items that you haven't touched yet she had that you do want to work on\nYes one one of them is the the two bills or one was represented the NATO and I'm One of the Republicans rap or\nTo work on in the best interest of the children are the some concerns about the changing landscape of grandparents raising their grandkids because the parents are are you the last ... are suffering with opioid uh some of the some of the legislation that exists is is not really taking into account what's happening these days I'm\nHis issues with custody those issues with the grandparent on Social Security affording\nTo take care of kids and they weren't expecting to take care of a an this legislation addresses that it's very important it's it's bipartisan a one Republican one Democrat Bill that complement each other and I had committed myself to working on those that is one of the first things when we get back\nAnd I committed myself to working on those that is one of the first things when we get back\n[noise] um you know as you said you've actually worked in a lot of times you've you've been to the Larson senior center if you see it seems that that you if you had said last time that you're very impressed with the with the work that they've done here there\nUm and that's ... that's got to be you

for much hero to knock or chink in the armor\nComment I don't think he meant that kind of ...\nI don't think he meant you know the kind that Dr slow in the left hand lane I think he meant you know a dent in the armor but any who I'm Ron Darling other than off used idiom that dates back centuries Saturday Night but he's still found himself in hot water with parts of the Twitter mob\nWater with parts of the Twitter mob is that a micro aggression mentioning I think in the armor when a Japanese\nPictures on the mound and remember as Bill Maher always said [noise]\nShouldn't the best response

pitcher Marcia hero to an ... battle with control as a change in the armor\n[noise] again now to show you how times have changed Peter blue said something about that about ... in two thousand seven nobody thought twice about it of course whenever I Would see dice game ... for the Boston Red Sox my reaction would always be\nThrow the ball for God's sakes throw that damn ball remembered dice K\nWould just hold on to the ball hold on to the ball for like thirty seven seconds before throwing every pitch he won Eighteen games one year when Eighteen in three\nNot by fooling batters not by challenging batters but by boring them to death oh God any who despite that saying dating back more than six hundred years the New York daily news accused darling\nBack more than six hundred years the New York daily news accused darling of using a racial slur\nThat's ridiculous an assertion apparently based on the fact that ... is Japanese know a few Chinese it'd be offensive but he's Japanese doesn't even said\nDarling whose mother is Hawaiian Chinese apparently felt he needed to make a statement apologizing for his use of words so did you hear that Ron Darling himself has Chinese ancestry but he's a racist wow\nThis is where my liberal brothers and sisters really really really get in trouble um we stop focusing so much on the words and focus a little bit more on the intent [noise]\n[noise]\nFor instance Ron ... comment about a drink in the armor my God he meant a weakness a weakness in the Yankees pitching staff are crying out loud that's completely on offensive my comment earlier about driving slow in the left hand lane\nNow that offensive you have to know the difference folks wow while the word chink itself undoubtedly is an awful slur no one would know better than darling giving his heritage\nHis track record as a TV announcer also speaks for itself so the fact that darling still decided to apologize says a lot about his character or the current social climate or both TBS will not disciplined Ron Darling for the comment and he'll be back on the call\nMonday Night that was last night a four game three between the Yankees and Red Sox wow wow that that

to go back to the days back to the days were coaches coached during the week and on game days players made the decision when I was playing a a level rugby highest level rugby in Miami in Florida\nPlayed for the Miami rugby football club they won they won the Florida rugby union championship six years in a row six years in a row I made the a side\nAnd they didn't want to seventh rats are back in those days that was a eighty three three eighty five\nOr coaching was not allowed in rugby not allowed the captain on the field made the decisions are kept and was a guy named Franco was Perry anyway he played wing forward a play for the American eagles that was the national team at the time\nOr the captain the captain made the decisions on the field not the coach the coach coach during the week on game day it was up to the players so in baseball\nThe coach coach during the week on game day it was up to the players\nSo in baseball no look into the dugout to call the pictures

[noise] [noise]\nOh man oh man [noise]\nThings are going great [noise]\nI'm telling you how can things get any better than they are right now it's amazing our growth rate [noise] pardon me our unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent I I Can't even find anything on the Internet that's telling me\nWhen was the last time that we had a growth rate this\nI I Am so so so very happy not only for myself\nBut for so many people out there because it's hard sometimes to find a job and with the unemployment rate being lowered it as it is\nIt means that there's a lot of opportunities for people to get another job to switch jobs to kind of leverage their current job to maybe negotiate a little bit of a pay raise retention bonus\nWhen there are a plethora of jobs available there are opportunities opportunities for it not just to employees to to get you know get their best deal but also for employers to really start thinking outside the box and\nBut also for employers to really start thinking outside the box in terms of what is it that I can do to make my my um my uh business better to make it more efficient to kind of harvest and and and leverage on what I've got and I think mostly mostly mostly mostly\nIt helps employers to ask a really important question and that is what can I Do to help my employee's day because when the unemployment rate is three point seven percent and there's lots of jobs available and people are willing to pay for talent\nIf you're not treating your people well if you're not trained them with respect and with dignity they're going to walk out the door because it's easy to do so\nAnd I'm telling you it and these days it's easy\nBut even in an era of three point seven percent unemployment I got to tell you\nYou still got to be prepared [noise] I've been doing some uh screenings for my current employer and I'll tell you some of those questions that people are the answers that they're giving me when I asked them questions has absolutely amazed me\nAbsolutely amazed me but\nThis is nothing compared to other interviews that I've had I've actually had interviews with candidates\nThat the candidates have told me that um you know they like they like working in accounting I'm the only problem is is that the last two accounting jobs they were fired because they were caught embezzling money but the he paid it back I mean I don't know what the what the problem was it was just that he was having a little bit of shortage and [noise]\nYou know he figured he could just take a little bit of money and pay it back and I said well\nOkay so that happened once um why did it happen again he says he's so do do you know things happen and I I needed some money and so I I told them you know I I appreciate you are coming in but I don't know if I have a job for you\nAppreciate you are coming in but I don't know if I have a job for you I'm quite frankly I I'm a nurse I'm nervous that ah that you're going to or you're going to steal from me\nAnd his response was don't worry about it man it's okay you know just because I did it the ... I I Wish I were I Wish I were lying and I wish I were exaggerating this interview this is exactly what happened the guy said you know I I assure you\nIt happened then but but you know I'm doing pretty good these days so I don't think I'm going to be needing any extra money if you pay me well [laughter]\nAnd they will eventually when we're kind of in the same boat right now the Vietnamese have realized you know what we're going to have to we're gonna have to partner up\nAgainst the the Chinese or else they're going to keep our clocks as well and so they've they've established a almost de facto alliance with a Japan and of course since Japan is our friends they say the friend of my friend the friend of my ... was the enemy the friend of my friend just\nThe the friend of my ... was the enemy the friend of my friends my friends as well I think that's the case and the enemy of my friend is my my enemy I forget exactly how that that singles [noise]\nBut I think we've come a long way from from fighting the Vietnamese and inflicting terrible casualties and really damaging their land\nTo realizing that we have a common ... full not enemy but full that we need to defeat in the marketplace and in the in the public arena\nAnd if necessary perhaps on the battlefield if if such comes you know if it's such things come to to pass\nHope that's not the case that is the last thing I Want to do and that is she a conflict between China and the U.S I Know I talk a lot and I and I am kind of um [noise] I'm confrontational when I talk about a ... the Chinese government a dream I kind of ... and it sounds like I'm a warmonger\nI Am a combat vet and the last thing I Want to see is my children\nHaving to fight a war in the far off land that said there are times when one must stand firm and say this far and no further\nAnd have the means to back it up and that is why the United states is conducting freedom of navigation acts\nThat's why the United states has imposed tariffs on two hundred billion dollars of Chinese good and the Chinese have retaliated by in a imposing tariffs on these sixty three billion dollars of Chinese goods are Americans are cuts pardon me that they that they import\nYou see what I mean two hundred billion versus sixty sixty three billion this is the trade imbalance that I'm Talking about part of it is probably natural because\nThis is the trade imbalance that I'm Talking about part of it is probably natural because of cost of labor\nInfrastructure and all this stuff that I that I understand I mean I preach that all the time but when you introduce barriers and you introduce distortions in in the marketplace in order to to foment an order to to distort competition\nOr in your favor than we've got these problems and this can no longer continue the way it does do I buy Chinese goods [noise]\nYeah I Do and you know what sometimes rather than buying Chinese good from a store just buy them straight from China\nUm and but I Am looking for options I don't like having to spend my money outside of kind of my market I really am I I'm a catalyst when it comes to that I Would rather spend my money here in the U.S [noise]\nUm but at the same time I'm not so stupid that I can and I'm going to spend five thousand dollars for an American made suit because it's American Made and I want to buy American Made so I'm gonna buy this ... soup because obviously that's that's ridiculous I Can't do that I don't have the money to buy five thousand dollar suit\nBut I had the money to buy a five hundred dollars so I have the money to buy a five hundred dollar cooks at a cook ...\nI've got a couple of hundred bucks to buy I classrooms um that are nice why why all these I'd lost friends made in other countries why can't they may be made here\nUm there are so many opportunities and I'm now I'm I Am I'm preaching to those of you may be some young people out there that are wondering what do I want to do with my life become a manufacturer\nThink of something that you can make see what you can do if it's something that requires crowd sourcing maybe you need to to put together a [noise] a small maybe have an interest in middle working and you've got to lay maybe you need to if you you you're thinking hey you know what if I had a high speed\nThe working and you've got to lay maybe you need to if you you you're thinking hey you know what if I had a high speed late I could make instead of making ten of these a week to sell I can with a high speed limit can maybe make a hundred that's the kind of thinking I really want my audience to to to half\nHow can you come up with something to create value not just for yourself but for your country\nI'm always looking for opportunities I'm always looking to to try to figure out a partnership and I get my fair share of people saying Henry I got a great business idea all your city thousand you know of your dollars\nAnd my response was that's a great idea how much money you putting a are you putting and they go oh no no not putting in any of my money in someone actually told me no no this ideas too risky to for me to and you know for me to risk any of my money and my response to then why are you asking me to risk model cars you got you got a lot more than I Do\n... says and you think I got more money than you I don't I'm a working Joe I I have a daytime job I go to Boston actually Cambridge\nEveryday except for doing this um to to to work I earned my living I save my money but I'm not I'm not swimming and do what I've got\nI've got because I said\nThat all set again think about opportunities what is it that you can make what is it that you can do are you a Baker do you like to bake\nDo you know that um there was this cookie store oh God I hate it when I forget names oh ... Mrs Fields' cookies thank you lord\nMrs field's was a real woman and she like to bake cookies and so people would tell her while your cookies are fantastic you should sell these as she thought people are right I could sell these as she started to bake cookies in her home and sell them and\nEventually she had to find a bigger place to Baker cookies and she did and then she started selling them to stores and then she started this the ah having these cookies and the chaos\nShe started selling them to stores and then she started this though are having these cookies and the kiosks in the mall and uh that was kind of the first you know I guess concept like a cookie concept in a mall and as she did very well now you've got a [noise]\nYou've kind of course at the ice creams which have always been there and then you've got the the uh the pretzels what sells pretzels I think they're called which I like\n'em and people are always coming up with concepts but that was a lady who was good at something and took an idea and made it happen what is your idea there is a um [noise] the the intermittent windshield wiper that gentleman that to a guy who actually invented that\nAnd of course you had to fight a battle with the car company 'cause they stole his up Paton but he came up with an idea I saw it and he came up with an idea patented the idea and then um sold the pat and you know so patent rights for others to manufacture\nThe little um [noise]\nThe cardboard sleeves that ah that you put her on a coffee cup at Starbucks that was a person who actually invented that\nAnd I don't know if he's still getting a penny but at one point he was getting a penny for every one of those sleeves hey\nThat doesn't sound like a lot but think of is a hundred million sleeves manufactured where he gets a penny do the math that's a million dollars for basically saying here you go you have my permission\nOr many many you at my permission to to\nManufacture my sleeves that will be a penny penny each\nThat's how colonel Sanders made his money in the beginning he made his money by selling his chicken on commission at five cents apiece so not commission pardon me for a licensing fee so every time a store or restaurant would use his recipe\nThey would pay colonel Sanders five cents for every piece of chicken that they sold\nHey colonel Sanders five cents for every piece of chicken that they sold that they cooked and served using the colonel's recipe I don't know how he kept track of all that stuff but what he did he discovered other ways to to to make it more efficient\nThe point I'm making is that throughout time\nThere had been needs and there have been different needs because five hundred years ago there was no need for a cardboard sleep for a a double latte mocha I'm with extra cream and whatever [noise] two hundred years ago there was no need for intermittent windshield wiper\nI'm\nThirty years ago there was no need within my lifetime there was no need for a cell phone a charger\nI'm ten years ago we didn't think we had a need for a wireless cell phone charger and now I take my cell phone when I go to work I place it on the cell phone charger I don't have to plug it in ultimate laziness [laughter] I don't have to find a plug that just\nPut it on the on the little charging pad every period of time has different needs it is those people who are who have their eyes open entered constantly looking for opportunities and see a need and feel the need those are the people that become rich\nI Want my audience to become rich because I didn't tell you this but when you listen to my show and you're successful you have to give me one percent of your income that is that as my commission for inspiring you to be successful\n[noise]\nTake risks don't be crazy look for opportunities it doesn't matter how old are how young you are\nSees it when you see it will be right back\n\n\nThe national diversity graduate fair will take place on October thirteenth from three PM to six PM at Rhode Island colleges Murray's center attendees can speak with graduate admissions representatives from local and national colleges and universities\nThey all have the opportunity to learn more about admission requirements application deadlines financial aid opportunities and more the fair is free and open to those considering graduate school\nKudos to you or any

you know if if if people are upset by that you don't want to work for that organization because their their state and they're they're probably they got issues that silo issue they got\nProbably in communication and she's got all kinds of issues you know and I don't know about you but I got enough issues in my life without working for a company that has issues\nSo do you want a job at a General Motors find out who the ... and manufacturing find who the director is [noise] and ah reach out to them for their resume say hey I realized that um\nAnd to reach out to them for their resume say hey I

Asia Minor kingdom of lady and the ... century bc as old as a huge debt of gratitude for mentioning the world's first coinage\nThere by creating an a single stroke the lifeblood of every business liquidity and cash flow\nAnd ah as someone who owns gold I Do on physical gold and no I Do not have it in my home I have it in a nice safety deposit box here in town somewhere it's nice to go every couple of months and put another coin in sometimes I put it out since sometimes they would have on sometimes ... rounds on but it sure is nice to take 'em out kinda mall and look at them\nBut half sometimes called routes um but it sure is nice to take 'em out kinda mall and look at them I've got some silver in there too so thank you can trust us fermenting coinage or wherever his opulent lifestyle has given entrepreneurs throughout history something to shoot for\nUm [noise] is there a greater distinction for the commercially inclined than to be deemed as rich as across the U.S well never heard that one but maybe I'll start using that\nHere's another one number two my goodness I'm this is a pope six does the fourth six just gets the not for realizing that the wages of sin meant more than just an unpleasant repercussion ... death that's the Bible says the wages of center is death\nBut pope sixty has discovered that wait a minute it doesn't have to be that way because there was money to be made and damnation as six does minded by opening up a new market remember I talked about creating opportunities well he did the same thing he created one for the dead for indulgences at the church had been selling for years\nRelatives of the deceased quickly filled Vatican conference with payments intended to lessen the time that their loved ones spent in purgatory all such loving or people\nIn fourteen Seventy eight six just grew his market by authorizing the Spanish Inquisition which swelled purgatory is ranks by a hundred thousand soldiers in Fifteen Years which meant more money more money more money [noise] he was also the first pope to license Brussels\nIf you're Catholic hey don't blame me this is your history I'm ... and it's sometimes history sometimes it ain't pretty let me put it that way it is what it is a PC Barton let's move on before a I got angry calls from Catholics [noise]\nUm I Love my Catholic brothers and I admire the ... okay let's go on P. T. Barnum Americans have always loved the good scan and ... Taylor also known as P. T. Barnum took the art to new heights\nHe is Taylor also known as P. T. Barnum\nTook the art to new heights he played on our fascination with the bazaar and freakish with sideshow acts ranging from his midget Thompson Tom Thumb to jumbo the giants elephant in between was a host of more dubious curiosities he created the Barnum Bailey circus of the showcase for all of this wonder meant\nAnd dubbed it the greatest show on earth\nAlong the way he invented modern advertising and became rich for the record he never said there's a sucker born every five minutes\nBut he left behind plenty of other bond markets among them every crowd has a silver lining [laughter] P. T. Barnum [noise]\nThomas Edison what do you say about the man who gave the world the electric like the photograph talking motion pictures and more than one thousand three hundred Patton in inventions\nThat he was the world's greatest and venture absolutely but he was also able to exploit the profit potential in this creations\nChopping oriole bent that assert itself when Edison was a teenager printing a newspaper in the baggage car of a rolling trying\nAnd then selling copies to passengers his impact on the way people live was and is pervasive as a combination of inventive genius and I'm Talking to a real flare he stands alone and boy do I agree he was also a deeply flawed individual but that does not take away anything from who he was\nOur president is a deeply flawed individual he's got major issues but you know what I ... I may not like what he says but I sure do like what he's doing Henry Ford number six\nFord also fundamentally changed human lifestyles by making available a vehicle the model T that vastly extended people's range of movement the automobile which would allow America America's masses to fulfill their manifest destiny to populate every corner of the continent but as more profound impact\nFulfill their manifest destiny to populate every corner of the continent but as more profound impact was on industry the moving assembly line that he designed to build this car was the signal breakthrough of the industrial age appropriately for earned the seed capital for his enterprise by working as an engineer at the Edison eliminating company in Detroit\nSo funny how they're connected\nBenjamin Segal known as the bugs eat to his friends Siegel was a notorious mobsters with a touch of the visionary legend has it that he singlehandedly invented Las Vegas and of course that's a stretch but he was the first to see what the town could become a lush oasis of pleasure or gambling with just one of the attractions\nHe also proved adept at attracting other people's money to build an iconic resort to flamingo trouble or some of those other people belong to an outfit called the mafia and Siegel was gunned down in Nineteen forty seven amid ruin are rumors that he had stolen from his partners\nBut give the devil is due before there was ... that was a Bugsy\nRay crock o' we've talked about him nothing says entrepreneur like persistence and nothing says persistence like ray crock the kitchen where salesman who had been in Nineteen fifty four at age fifty two and in poor health\nHad his imagination hijacked by a family run restaurant in the desert outside Los Angeles\nOnce he had brought he had bought out that McDonalds brothers crock proceeded to take the concept of a limited menu fast service low prices and expanded nationally in the process creating the fast food industry and dramatically affecting America's lifestyle and sadly collective\nHealth all the I guess there's a dark cloud [noise] does it by the way this is from NBC News really funny um\nOr whether that was science whether that was a philosophical premise or um [noise] a a an event in history what led to that particular event in history 'cause nothing takes place in a vacuum\nCollege taught me how to think college taught me to appreciate things one of my most\nTreasured courses was uh the books that I that I studied for a black studies course I'm not black but it was it was a lightning to understand history from the black perspective which is very different than what you see in most history books\nI loved studying astronomy but kind of sciency but it wasn't my my uh my focus it took a year of astronomy and I still use what I learned there now and I teach is trying to make to my kids to the kids at church I take them on tours I have three\nAnd I teach is trying to me to my kids to the kids at church I take them on tours I have three telescopes are yeah three telescopes and tubing occupiers so I guess I Am a geek [noise]\nBut what I what I became an college or when I started to become in college that's where I started kind of developing who I Am my passions my appreciation [noise]\nI never would have picked up a book um on philosophy of hadn't taken philosophy I never would have understood really understood black history and I said they're going to a course in black history and yes I took calculus yes I took chemistry yes I took\n'em or other classes but but college taught me many things but it taught me to learn it taught me to have an appreciation for things to have to be able to step outside of my current perspective and and and look at someone else's perspective\nI'm from their perspective I guess\nI think many of our politicians have forgotten that and again recent events that made me made me think that uh they're not teaching that in college anymore\nBut if you want to go to college and you just say that you can't afford it there are other alternatives now they're actually very many inexpensive alternatives\nThere online colleges and um there are ... and the U.S in their online colleges overseas\nNow be careful with the overseas call just because they may be inexpensive but they may not be accredited so basically it doesn't count that you have a bachelor's or a mess degree from the you know mum moved all University of Calcutta I'm but I'm taking a master's degree\nIn business administration\nAnd I'm taking I'm doing it on line uh taking online classes at Adventist International University and my master's degree is going to wind up costs me about\nI think when all of a sudden done about six thousand bucks\nCost me about I think when all of a sudden done about six thousand bucks that's the price of a you know decent used car\nIs it going to help me and my career no probably not not at this point at this point in my career I Know I can say that pretty much other people younger people yes but I'm not taking I'm not getting a masters um to enhanced my career I'm taking it\nTo continue to learn and to be better I Would I Do an attack bragging rights [laughter] 'cause my daughter's getting imagine so I got to keep up [laughter]\nActually it's not that important but it's important to me I I've been a lifelong learner and I and I have a bunch of alphabet soup certifications after my name [noise]\nUm and I just want to add the NBA to that [noise]\nUm but if you have a lot of will but not a lot of wallet there are American online uh colleges that can that do it very good job of of of providing you with a with a with an education depending on what you're looking for\nIf you want to be a nurse you're going to have to do ... you know real like hands on nursing so\nUm there's some there's some ah fields of study that are just not conducive to on line\nBut if you're an LPN you can't take on my course to become an RN and dump basically double your your hourly rate when you go from El Pianta are in which is true by the way I'm so that's certainly worth it um but there are if you if you go online and do a Google Search on the most affordable colleges\nThere's a bunch of them um western governors university or Thomas Edison State University chadron state to state American public university of nuts some of these you know you don't really know them but these are actual universities so these are not like online diploma meals these are actual universities that have online components\nThat are a heck of a lot cheaper than um you know then the the alternatives [noise] you can also go\nThen um you know then the the alternatives [noise]\nYou can also go you know and and go with the traditional university and that's what my children have decided to do two of the three\nOne went to Bridgewater State University which is by the way at the least at least expensive\nCollege in Massachusetts and that's what she wanted she wanted to get a degree she wanted to be a teacher she didn't want to you know be a teacher to go to college at like let's say ... to become a teacher she went to Bridgewater state because she understood that that was a teacher's college\nHas always been they provide a good education a at a reasonable tuition and when she graduated she graduated with with some um college loans because that's the fact of you know that's the reality of these days of going to college\nBut she graduated and her college loans are minimal and after two years of working her and her husband\nNow or homeowners so there aren't that many twenty five year olds out there that actually own their own homes and um have minimal college uh a debt but she was smart I mean she worked her way through\nShe worked with a college she worked in during summer she worked you know in school she had a ... second shop she worked weekends ... she is she has a machine I'm I'm so proud of her just like her dad [noise]\nUm my son my son has decided to go to a UMass Amherst which has a significantly more expensive college but it's also the cheapest college that has a degree in biomedical engineering so again he was thinking the same thing this is that it has a program that I Want\nThe at the rate that I can afford so when I graduated I don't graduate with a hundred thousand dollars in debt and graduated with a manageable amount of debt and I'm children that burden with him because it's significantly more expensive and so he and I have decided to partner\nSo what is the most expensive college in Massachusetts well\nSo what is the most expensive college in Massachusetts well it's a college it's called Bard College I never even heard of this place\nIt's fifty one thousand dollars fifty will actually fifty one thousand seven hundred thirty five dollars a year\nThat's in state tuition Amherst is fifty one thousand Williams is fifty one tough fifty one my my ah niece went to Tufts my poor sister that that experience cost her about a quarter million dollars a when all of a sudden done\nUm it was worth it but it that's what it costs my my sister to send her daughter\nTo to tough and she's got another one in college right now BU or Boston College pardon me be the is fifty thousand or fifty thousand four hundred and eighty Brandeis\nForty nine ... be you forty nine wheat in college right here down the road forty eight but definitely worth it Wellesley College forty eight Holy Cross forty apps and forty eight\nMIT surprisingly is Thirteen at a forty eight thousand northeastern forty six which are Polytechnic forty six and I would have loved for my son to go there he wanted to go to that school but\nUnfortunately it was it was too expensive and what they were looking for in terms of candidates and what they offer is not that there wasn't a match between my son and the school um but I I was impressed with the college I was impressed with the students\nAnd those kids when they graduate I think even with a hundred and twenty a hundred fifty thousand dollars\nIn student debt they probably they can pay that off and probably three years I mean these these that's their that's starting salaries for students graduating from Worcester Polytechnic is a hundred thousand dollars it's amazing to me they make a hundred thousand dollars\nMeanwhile most university graduate that they're lucky if they get like forty to forty three\nMost university graduate that they're lucky if they get like forty to forty three\n'em knowing the conservative conservatory of music forty four [noise]\nThat's a tough one I'll tell you if you want to go to school to major in music\nUnderstand one thing I Hope that you either come from a very rich family or you've invented something that gives you a lot of cash flow that you don't have to worry about making money because with a degree from the New England conservatory of music after graduating with all that that\nIt's going to be very hard for you to find a job that pays a lot of money it's just it's their reality [noise] I see my friends Frederick from that school with two hundred thousand dollars in debt after a master's degree and and they're working as reception is at a some high tech company\nSo deciding what you want to do with your life and going to college very very important my middle son I'm not sure if you're listening show if you are listening Joe text me\nBut my middle son was smart he went to two years a community college because his goal was to transfer to a higher cost school later but after two years of college he realized that that's just wasn't for him he he he was ... wasting his time he wants to be a more hands on type of person and so\nHe decided to go ahead and um or go to trade school and he ... he he completed his age fat course\nAnd uh he's currently in the market and actually it's going to do and he says that later on he'll go to school and he made explore the online options because he does want to settled cell protect very very smart all of my kids are smart all of my kids are on track I'm very proud of them\nI didn't know what I was doing but based on what I've heard I probably would have done something terrible which would which would have ruined my life thank you for saving me who knows\nThat could be the ... I could be that could be the uh the un secretary that that that that I say I don't know I don't know that I don't remember their names but what I'm saying is that you have great potential to be powerful in\nThis world do the right thing be excellent at what you do and always always always look up to heaven for inspiration and when you do when you look for inspiration you will definitely find it I'll see you next week God Bless [noise]\nYou're listening to W.

it doesn't seem as though people are that apt to\nAllow us to use their houses as much as it used to be so sometimes it's tied getting the houses but if anybody's interested give me a call\nAgain I mean that's exactly what we're here for the people know how how\nGive me a call again I mean that's exactly what we're here for the ... people know how how they can get involved in the community to help but help\nHelp preserve because I mean we've all seen as you know as we drive around New England some communities that really have gone all out and trying to preserve a everything and anything that the that they can um [noise]\nI Know that we had a you know some issues in the past you remember when we were talking about ... ... ah what did we caught historical rode\nThe scenic wrote on ... wrote ordinance yeah that would that we batted around for years and years and years and years and I'm nodding off the council for for years it has anything ever actually come of that as I Know we pretty well\nPut it aside let's say yeah I'm not sure whether it will come back or not but um it's just something that the Massachusetts historical commission suggested that local historical conditions use as a tool to preserve the history and so that's why we wanted to try and get it on the books but\nIt just wears out all the time no it doesn't and unfortunately as time goes on to become fewer and fewer roads that probably sort of meet the criteria that\nAre feeling through buildings we all we have to one of the things we strive for is to find new uses for old buildings and hearing ... we've really done a good job with that\nYou know there's a lot of buildings that have been a change totally from what they were originally to you know like the sweet house the first mass houses literacy center you know the fire station is the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just a great new uses\nFor old buildings that need to remain standing and be a part of our heritage\nRight now and why not just like finding something to do with the building the good good musicians and it's it's making good utilization delivers the Senate building gets so much so much you send\nThat's gorgeous building it really it really is and it's well built ... you know\nMuch youth and that's a gorgeous building it really it really is and it's well built ... you know on they don't build them like they used to I think that's one of the kids why a lot of these properties have survived over the years is that they really were well built convince some of the stuff we see today\nYup my house as strong as anything he'd go to bang bang a nail into those signs beams like Andrew and beans and you bend the nail over\n[laughter] that's pretty good\nI I mentioned one of the difficulties people have when they said they they buy it older property like that and they want to stay with the historical theme ... make it seem timely it must be difficult sometimes to get materials and stuff that match up with the time Ira especially when you get further back there's lots of\nBusinesses out there now that really concentrate on that and and uh you know pride themselves and being available with all of restoration materials that you need and especially now that you're on line getting everything it doesn't matter where it is you can get it\nMm well that's good to hear yeah oh yeah yeah so what other activities besides the historical commissions society what other stuff have you been involved in over the years when I'm sure there's a lot of what I said\nI Belong to those two things but I also belong to DARE and we're very we're very very proud of our little pack house the Seventeen twenty three house on on the corner of Elizabeth and knocked me that's earlier than my house\nIs not that that's basically right across where CBS yes it is you know if people want the snow you want to talk about what about what the DARE for so many people out there might not be familiar with ...\nDARE is a a national organization and Arab rose chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started here in Massachusetts back in Nineteen oh one and it has to do with your genealogy mostly you have to prove that you are related to and I are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary\nWhen a are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary war and uh you you have to go through all of the genealogy to prove that and then this what this this group does themselves as we try to preserve patriotism and we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we try to um\nPraise the students who are into history and that type of thing uh but it's uh like I said it's a national organization\nThat's really written it and it's the chop the here's been since Nineteen all one yes I had well that's a that's a long well established younger an association yes and no did you get involved with that when you first moved to the community is\nAgain it was when I was trying to attract the history of my house and so um that that was one of the groups that I joined also but I'm also a member of the ... museum I oil paint I don't know if everybody knows that HUD and I sell my paintings\nYet so I'm I Do oil paintings and um I can do them to order you've been anything all your life you know I started hearing about the seventies and for ... the older folks that are watching this um maybe they remember either race I have a race was an art teacher here in ... I took from her for ten years\nSo um and I did things like on adult beds and and uh all the local things summer school at ... high and two for the ap courses\nThat's really neat yeah and then I also belong to the triborough called that club [noise] oh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original member of the club started forty years ago this this year coming and um we've got a Nineteen sixty two Corvette and we've had it for thirty eight years and we um\nBoth thought you know yeah thirty yes and um we'd love to go out and ride around in it and we've got a lot of a good friends in the quote that club and it's great fun still\nYou must give me a lot of people you know all those shows copies\nIt's great fun still you must get me a lot of people you know what about all those shows how people are good people\nThat's great yeah that's where it's no there any uh activities and the community that you've thought about getting involved with it maybe haven't yet had the time or\nI think I've really between my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight grandchildren and one and a half great grandbabies wow so um that takes up you know\nA lot of time to you and uh yeah so I think I'm actually involved in enough things winter without any more you\nKnow what what again when you when you first moved out of ... and you interested in researching the history of your house um\nThat led to getting involved in community activities but um I think today there are a lot of people out there that I find it a little bit harder to get involved in the community there not quite you know the spill lifestyle just so much busier they work out of town um\nYou have a suggestion for people who are thinking about jihad us you know I'd like to get involved with something that\nYou know when you started to say that something went through my head and it was something that my chemistry teacher in high school said to me and I've never forgotten it you always find the time to do the things you really want to do [laughter]\nOkay so if somebody really wants to do it there's so many things available in outer borough I mean there's a genealogy club at the library that does the YMCA has all these programs that library has a whole bunch of programs and then all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um\nEven even when you've worked at the factories this I I actually belong to the ... for retirees to the gold black schools\nThat's just because I worked out for a for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in ... and you know if somebody really wants to do what they find a way so\nOkay so you have any you know we always have people who are saying that they think the city should do this city should do that\nWell is that people who are saying they they think the city should do this the city should do that do you have any things that you you would like to see the city maybe trend to do more of that maybe we're not right now\nI think the city's doing pretty good I think everything looks terrific I like some of the um\nLike the lamp posts I'd like the lamp post their their intake looking and and not brings back that character rip the city that we we have had and and not proof where we came from we have to know where we came from you know where we're going so\nWell absolutely especially I think in the holidays with the lights and I think it really does add a certain New England homey feel kinda to it\nI'm One of the things that you know we think about historical stuff in the city is one of the things I think of is like Cape and park you know I mean they don't Bill Gates they don't make parks like that anymore you know it's basically the ones that exist exist and it's unlikely that in future they'll develop um\nBut uh we saw recently there was this talk about um [noise]\nRenovating some of the monuments and there are I think specifically wonderfully well more or have you been involved in all of that or do you know anything you might be an ad about that that\nOne of the Memphis about commission is on that committee felt that he is our liaison between it um it's it's a Beautiful Mind unit it's the most beautiful monument in the city and um it needs a lot of care and maintenance and um if they can raise the money to do it that would be great ...\nI can remember you know as a little kids you know forty years ago over the plane in the park on the monument and you know I think it was sort of some old and weathered at that point you were in mining on it now I we we probably would work which is probably what led to getting the condition um but but there are so many\nLittle things like that that a historical in our city that people don't necessarily think about but there are lots of monuments around right in\nA city that people don't necessarily think about but there are lots of monuments around that and not to mention all the old burial ground since I'm a wasn't a victim Bonneville who is involved a few years back and sort of documented and come\nTapes on the burial grounds yes he did a fantastic job yeah\nAnd um and then I think at some point in what the the boy scouts involved was helping to clean up some of\nThe old ... will have a boy who's going to be looking for an eagle project come to us and ask us about the a burial ground or whatever and they'll do a big cleanup where one year we had a boy that I'm actually got a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Attleboro", "day": "09"}
