Jim\nWell we've got again are mostly clear skies early this morning again a day with a final shy and essentially all day now they may be a few ... high clouds at times this morning but\nOverall the sun will shine and uh that's good news we're going to have temperatures are getting into the middle and upper fifties this afternoon we'll have still a pretty good breeze\nOr as always at this time of the morning when this could breathe something's going on we had the passage of that cold front which by the way I looked at all the observations overnight and uh the one reporter from Adel borrow wind damage on ... street\nUh we've lived branches and powers down at Brown St an adult Berlin some reports on it Fall River New Bedford not a surprise to Fall River of course we\nAll know Fall River very hilly city and a lot of times they have wind issue was up there on tops of some of those hills so Blount street in ... where a report though it was called into the weather service in ... at any rate we're going to have a sky is mostly clear tonight falling down to the low end mid forties setting the stage or\nNot a bad day tomorrow sunshine a few clouds those we'll call it southern clubs\nBecome a little breezy in the afternoon should briefly aspect to sixty but that would be more like around one o'clock and then cooling off towards stock much colder tomorrow night and as I said earlier the wind chill issues with\nDark much colder tomorrow night and as I said earlier the wind chill issues will kick in the early season wind chill issues mid forties that's it with the sun shines do puffy clouds on Thursday when children the thirties much of the day\nSo they're likely for the first time you're going to be out earlier even out anytime during the day a sort of a white coat might be a certainly something you'll be wearing especially if you're going to be outside for a while that on Friday after some process will monitor that might be the finished\nFinishing season for some of the plants around the area but they are especially the vegetables obviously temperature should moderate friday afternoon to the lowest mid fifties so you get the idea\nUh it's got to be cool but again I'm this is Mother Nature paying us back for the overall warmth we've had late in the summer and into the early fall then on Saturday\nUpper fifties a few scattered showers against Saturday a little like yesterday we're much at the time it's not raining but there'll be a few widely scattered showers upper fifties in the colder weather moving in on Sunday probably not getting out of the middle and upper forties on Sunday so Sunday and Thursday either too cold days for the rest of the week\nAnd then as we go into next week continues coat on Monday but dry Monday morning could be featuring temperatures in the twenties in some areas yeah twenties now that might not be twenty two but maybe twenty eight twenty nine will monitor that\nAnd then Tuesday looks dry and eventually getting into put potential stormy weather again the water's warm unusually warm on the Atlantic in any kind of disturbing that gets out over the water will have to monitor that's why I mentioned yesterday about uh some heavier action potential that doesn't mean that directly affects us but the potential is there\nBeginning sometime late next week into\nThe following week which of course will include the close proximity to Halloween which I'll probably start talking about what I think around Halloween\nA coming up probably sometime tomorrow as we get out within about two weeks is reasonable\nComing up probably sometime tomorrow as we get out within about two weeks of reasonable time to even talk about it at all costs this year Halloween is on a Wednesday as I've said drawn to you before I think it should be the last Saturday\nIn October make it right in the middle of the weekend with all the kids can enjoy but as always then again who am I to say\nYeah hey so we don't make up the we don't make up the calendar and we don't make up those though it so we just go with the flow\nThat said by the way in the tropics one minor situations still just off the coast oils as new it's October ... just off of the Yucatan and Central America off Honduras or there's an area\nThat's being watched that may be so far south that believe it or not it might actually get back into the east Pacifica not ever get into the Gulf of Mexico so I'm somewhat of a less threat to Texas then what we were thinking last week however\nAre there is going to be a what a feature non tropical near Texas and in fact over the next several days it's going to be very dry overall stretch to much of the country the only state in the union is going to get decent rain for the rest of this week is Texas\nWith a front stalled out down there so you know the one in Texas so even parts of Louisiana even south Texas they're going to get some decent range which if anything they need so they should really probably won't be complaining too much but uh overall we're in we're mostly dry weather patterns through about Monday of next week\nAnd then as I said to him after that things could be a changing a little bit for the specially the eastern part of the country so again a as a kind of crazy wild as it was Yeah John brown street which I think what is in South Alabama\nRight yup breakdown by Coelho school yes\nRight yeah that's one report that needed a resolute a reservoir into the ... and a weather service out of a ... lot lot branch and power lines down in ground street now that doesn't mean they're out of others as an adult borrowing surrounding towns but uh that was the one that was called in um\nWas an adult Berlin surrounding towns but uh that was the one that was called and I'm also a and again all of these were right around one thirty two in the morning all jobs 'cause when this was coming through a Fall River tree down blocking one lane along route Seventy nine presidents avenue we all know that is in Fall River\nAnd also they hit with fifty eight mile an hour winds at Woods Hole or so again most of these again from the ... area of south but they were even worse on to the north as well parts of Rhode Island as you said a exit or Rhode Island or had some trees down\nAh Newport sustained winds of forty miles an hour a and again so again if it was a late night of which again is usually the best for\nMost people not having to deal with it but if there are certainly if a tree fell on your house wake you up and you know about it quickly so uh fortunately again nothing too serious or riding lane and ... for example trees wires down and ... lions getting all these that report was to Seventeen am so\nAgain or some people waking up early this morning and I'll end on this with some branches out in their neighborhood it's very scattered in isolated but we're at that did happen\nNow the album goal tapestry Nineteen Seventy one of the great Gerald gang up on our\nTuesday Morning

Kobus set of requests for stronger hunting laws\nSubmitted about two years ago by former city council of rocks in ... and has been rework into ordinance form on which a public hearing can be held ... taken if committee members eventually agree to send it to the floor now such a law has been elusive pray ever fall every fall I should say\nSince twenty Thirteen when residents\nFirst began to complain about hunting on private property allegedly after some no hunting science actually were post\nAbout hunting on private property allegedly after some no hunting signs actually were posted\nMuch of course has been said and what little has been done during the five years soccer although action was promise about two years ago when his holdings request for an ordinance actually were sent to the public safety committee\nOf course then chaired by constantly Peter Blair back and said tightening the rules on hunting is needed as more and more homes are built to encroach on some of the woodland cause a instead last may they also said a bay actually are aiming to kill the measure\nArguing more regulation is actually needed state law does not require hunters to get permission to hunt on private property not posted against trespassing but the state's department of fisheries and wildlife does advise that getting approval from their property owners\nIs strongly recommended as

Norton Broad Street and in Alabama brown avenue all these areas in the greater Albert area with ... coming down not a surprise was forty and fifty miles on a brief wind got us because of the leaves are still on the trees on the ground is quite Saudi from all the rain we've had over the last few weeks good news though not much rain over the coming days\nReached the mid to upper fifties this afternoon\nMid to a low forties tonight and then back to sixty tomorrow but much colder weather balloons in late in the afternoon down into the mid thirties on Thursday morning just be prepared for the call this morning as you had to work or school or whatever you're doing early Thursday it's going to be the coldest we've had so far the season only recovering back to forty five that's it\nAnd the wind was blowing much of the day create wind chills and authorities chance of frost on friday morning well monitored it could be the finishing end of growing season at least in parts of vegetables around the area than fifty three on friday afternoon a few light showers on Saturday upper fifties colder weather moving in on Sunday\nIn the mid to upper forties the way it looks right now and radical for this time of the year Monday may not get out of the low forties yeah low forties or high that's not the low Tuesday or maybe some rain lately again next week later next week or we'll have to monitor the oceans around the area not just here but in the Gulf of Mexico for\nPossible development not necessarily tropical but with the warm oceans\nYou start to get the contrast and as I mentioned yesterday during a some indications of or something similar in terms of the general weather pattern that we have back in Nineteen Ninety One uh which was the hurricane Bob hit and then we had that\nStorm that was out the hybrid storm that are formed east and south of Nova Scotia and a cause of the of course the movie to be written about it later with a Gloucester fisherman again I'm not trying to say that's going to happen but if the weather pattern in another week\nWas it last a fisherman again I'm not trying to say that's going to happen both of weather pattern and another week

the leaves have come down and you might want to wait uh maybe until the wind carved out later this afternoon matter of fact the lightest wins which is usually the opposite the latest wins today for

let it go as I've always said let it go till the end of the year unless you have a beautiful looking front lawn that you won't want to have if it's in the backyard who cares nobody can see it unless you go out there let let all the leaves come down to them just rake them once at the end of the season\nOr as I'm concerned for the back yard anyway and if you got that right in right now the rough

Hawkins here last week\nAnd now we've got a we've got Julie hall a and you probably do know who Julie hall is I Do a lot of people do good morning Julie good morning how are you I'm doing well and\nI'm just a few moments ago here in Studio and ah just said a house the campaign going so far\nBut the campaigns going really well we're ramping up obviously had\nI guess it's it's good and bad that you have an opponent in the primary I did not have an opponent in the primary and actually I have to say that Jeff Bailey spend very gracious he ran against me at the special election and was very very gracious\nAnd the fact that I Want in and said that you know he said I deserved to win and\nWhat isn't going to run again so that was really nice but the one thing it does doesn't it doesn't you know when you're out there I'm actively campaigning and you always are out there actively campaigning\nWhen you don't have an opponent there isn't that much focus upon you and even in the paper it was kind of hard me getting stuff in there I tried you know they were focused on the two campaigns that where they had a opponents running against each other it's he's made the two opponents yeah\nI also noticed a you know with a lot of the candidates out there and not just the un Jim ...\nYou know with the a lot of the of the candidates out there and not just the uh UN Jim Hawkins but the other three gentlemen who are running for city council or a lot of different um new signs out there and I understand you've got a you've got some newer signs that ah you recently put up as well\nAnd I think I have four different versions out there and it was interesting I had a gentleman say to me that he really likes my signs because they're different all over the city [noise] and it makes it nice to see them you know the Tampa variety of science and that's what you want to do I mean you want to attract attention and I think switching them up a little bit to help\nThat yeah the one that are the ones I've seen of course um is your um your career sign the veterans you know and um\nAnd then a couple of other ones are the false sign that you usually have the big for a science and then the small signs out there but\nUm and I was in my committee and I think that's one of the things that we get to do locally here it's actually we can see some of the reason\nI think that's one of the things that we get to do locally here it's actually we can see some of the results of the things that we do you know it's a very small community it's not like a big committee where you go at at the state and so we have some very direct\nAbility to bring results to the city so I'm very very proud of that and working with the council to do that but one of the things that I feel even more good about with that particular facility as someone came to me from the\nStore preservation committee and the store a commission and asked me to make sure as we went along with our buildings of things and buildings of that type to please preserve the history of the building so I was able to talk to through their lawyer\nThe contractor and said hey what do you think about this isn't it just so happens to be some grants out there which as I walked through the building and it was very nice I was able to take a tour through the building\nFor the ... I think this was the first tour of people that they took through and we asked for especially to go through it was when you when I Walk through it was just amazing beautiful it's going to end up being a Ninety One unit which actually scheduled to be a more units\nYou know always when you get into these things is you find in musical space and that's a very old building so it's down to Ninety One which is great but it's an income based\nHousing fifty five plus which\nBecause of that because we are fulfilling a requirement I don't really want to say requirement you need that I Need that we have here in the city the state did kick and some money for that which is very nice but also they were able to get on the um Nass Nash excuse me ... national park so registry\nAnd the national historic registry through the national Park Service that's how it went and from that they were also able to get some preservation money what a perfect storm I think it\nThey were also able to get some preservation money what a perfect storm I think it was just it's a perfect example of what can happen him outgrow if we could do it there you know like talk of the song from New York if we could do it that\nWe could do it anywhere and there's many many opportunities and I even heard people as we walk through just saying the same thing they started looking at thinking in their heads about different buildings thrown out over or perhaps this can work\nAnd it ends up being sort of a win win for both organizations not only just the city get to re purpose some of these beliefs that we so drastically need we fulfill the needs of some of the folks here that that need housing especially in ... specially fifty five plus\nI'm plus the contractor did pretty well and you know I did mention and asked specifically I said so you know I Know I Know you've got some grants and things of that sort I should have that work out I said was enough\nTo ... and he said yeah twenty ... nobody's going to say it was too much right but it was sufficient and it did help them get to the to where they needed to go so I thought this is just a wonderful thing we need to do more of these not only here\nBut every one of the city's up here in New England in this area has these sort of issues with olfactory sings as sort I did also see something recently in the paper where they started talking about north adult bird during\nThis is a nice thing to say and for me to be part of that and to have a result that I can see I Walk you know run and I run by it just about every other day 'cause that's when I run and I look at it and I saw them [noise] um San blasting the tower one morning and it's nice feeling was just such a really good feeling to see that\nYou also get a lot of you know when you're a and you do that all the time you were running and walking a throughout the city and you get to know people are as as you look at a place where what one thing I ... I Want to go back to you just said the the sixties or mechanics ... I'm going back to the historical ...\nSixties or mechanic street I'm going back to the historical commission\nThis must be I'm this must be like writes I'm a perfect thing to do especially with the historical commission marrying and writing and who is Ben I'm an outstanding woman for many many years given grants and giving these great things at city hall every once in a while\nThis must have been a write up her alley or to get this on historical commission I mean this building was around you know way way back and won the runoff factor exactly put in there is a lot of those buildings are like that the DARE building a here in our borough and some of these other facilities\nAre but I think uh with the historical commission I think as I said it's right up\nThere in ... was a key critical factor of getting that on the registry and get her information but I started thinking about you know downtown you know there's still some of the older buildings right downtown the areas that we're trying to develop show so you know if the possibilities here you know once you see something happen you know can happen\nSo you know that's one of the things that I I started thinking about that and that's it's an idea and once you have an idea and you see it happen it spreads and and that's the kind of thing we need\nThat things such that good things that spread the city\nThe or as you're going through ah going through your ah your campaign now into a sixth of November\nUh and of course beyond if all goes well ah there's there's a there's a lot of people out there that are asking questions or you're either walking or running or your different events are there more than one specific questions that people are coming up to you a and asking you you know as a state rep candidate\nSure I think in particular and again people say you know they want to go back and say what you you know the state and white issues and an opioid crisis is definitely an issue but when you're going door to door\nWhite issues and an opioid crisis is definitely an issue but when you're going door to door people don't ask you about those kinds of things they use people are asking things about adults or you know because that's what's important to them\nAnd I think in the one in particular as course to high school and the the cost to the seniors and a lot of them being very very concerned I hear that quite a bit\nI Do know that the council and I did put some legislation in myself I'd love to put some more legislation and when they come state rep [noise]\nUm I did some investigations and everybody knows that I have to say that everybody knows I'm the ultimate researcher I I get on the Internet and I'll find out if somebody else did it we're going to do it it can be done\nAnd if it can't be done we have to test it anyways I don't like when somebody said that can't be done right it's not a good thing you need to try and leads to go and explore it\nSo I did find Thirteen fourteen different states in the in the United states\nThat have tax freezes some of them are just flat out by age doesn't have to be an income base some of the income based so many different ways to do what I Would like to just a\nAn age uh-huh and say you have to this particular age you know pain anymore you're not going to be affected by any additional taxes\nSo if you think about what happened with the high school here and I do believe I have to say I definitely was an advocate for the new high school I really believe it needed to happen and I understand and it's I go around a little bit of a difficult discussion to have with people that I was an advocate of it\nBut I Do explain to them that I was an advocate and that now I Am trying to find some tax relief because I understand the repercussions as we will find with the state\nThe state makes decisions in that sense ... ripples down here the animal world that we have to deal with same thing when we're on the council locally we make decisions and that ripples down to other people and I think we realized that happens\nWe make decisions and that ripples down to other people and I think we realized that happens we try to mitigate that the best that we can\nSo I think the council is really looking hard at some of these ways to mitigate some some of that tax burden as well as other things you know there was also a trust fund that I suggested that be set up sink she caught uses it was brought to me by\nI'm Madeline and I proposed that you know people that were able to volunteer to this trust fund to give some extra dollars so there's a lot of things on the table right now that both locally and I'm legislatively through the\nUm to the house and Senate and uh I really am obviously big advocate of that and going to do everything in my power to see that that happens\nGoing through the uh uh with the campaign or you really have time to read sometimes uh uh and uh you got a very busy schedule 'em\nBut you do have sometimes you know that you can kind of relax what do you like to do I've been asking that somebody ah some of the your guest that we've had what do you like to do kind of I Know you're like the raw yeah you know what else do you does Julie hall like to do a you know on her spare time if you have any at all sure\nI Do like to stay in contact with my friends uh-huh especially through the phone through Facebook through the Internet I Do have a lot of friends that I keep up with in the military and I think\nFriendships and the people that have supported you all your life if you would they are who you are you and I think it's very very important that I keep in touch with them the best I can and that's difficult when we're all very very busy\nBut I Do make sure there's been people that have come into town and even though I look at the schedule and say I need to be out knocking doors I find a way to go and visit them I have a friend actually coming in soon and she was my non\nGo and visit them I have a friend actually coming in soon\nAnd she was my non commissioned officer and charging she and I became the best of friends we work together and it was interesting to female bosses always great you know

rest of the week through the weekend but not much in the way of rain\nAll right sounds good than we got some nice sunshine out there right now and hopefully that's that will stay all day long\nOr even other leave now starting to change a little more so with that sun shining off and maybe if you take a few minutes the check out some trees around the area today and I'll talk to you again tomorrow okay\nSounds good Jim thanks so much All right a state representative candidate to Julie hall in Studio with us or for another twenty minutes or so\nI'm a lot of things as I said do you ah you've gone through the city you've seen a lot of uh\nUh you know as you mentioned um buildings that are empty and hear the other thing is that you are working on as well is um small businesses small businesses or you want to see a lot more businesses\nCome to the city and I'm and basically it's one of your other one of your other big issues as well\nSharon certainly and thank you for that and also for bringing that up um\nI Do have a lot of experience with small business um despite what is seen on my opponents website it says I don't have experience that I had my own business when I got out of ... consulting business in health care not only that but\nI did work with two veterans a small business that's what I did I help do startups basically they were starting a business I came in because of my experience\nI help do startups basically they were starting a business I came in because of my experience in the hospital I knew about IT I knew about budget I knew about human resources I you know I think the the hospital ministers the Jack of all trades\nAnd hopefully I was a master of some of those but so it was really good to apply those skill sets in helping the small businesses and that's what I continue to do\nOnce I got into the planning board and learned about zoning and so forth and permitting and all these other things that just added to again to the the tool kit that I had already by working I'm with my own small business and learning what they had to go through\nOne of the things that I did understand I didn't think I you know I always said I was a person that was good at math\nAnd you know I learned though at hospital administrator and I worked for the department of defense in the finance area I learned a lot how to do what's called stepped down and to come for all costs and I think that was the most helpful thing I've learned in terms of budgeting\nHow do you collect and how do you understand it and then to fight all the costs that go into making for instance a medical visit\nAnd one that's going to be one of the issues that hopefully I'm going to be able to be a good advocate for its we'd go through fifty four percent of the budget in Massachusetts has healthcare\nUm but the small business I wasn't doors by the national federation of Independent Business I go after certain endorsements that are important to me I Want to be endorsed by the national federation of independent businesses because I Want to be recognized as someone who is an advocate of small business now\nI don't just say hey endorsed me I have to fill out a survey that's and I have to demonstrate that I have supported small businesses so they would not have given me the endorsement if they do not feel that I demonstrated that so I'm very very proud of that\nI mean the endorsement if they do not feel that I demonstrated that so I'm very very proud of that the other endorsement I go after is the Massachusetts corrections officers that are rated unions and these are both independent unions\nAnd I you know again I have nothing against um any special interest groups but I'm very very careful in my own self that I Do not some sign up or ... you know go through these surveys or actively\nUm pledged to any of these different special interest groups because I feel like I Need to be an independent voice how can I be an independent voice if I'm if I have all these ... people I'm beholden to [noise]\nSo I think that's one thing to look at the difference between myself and my opponent also he has twenty and I'm thinking how can you possibly do that I'm\nNot even being in the seat to establish the voting record yet you would think you know once you start voting that there'll be certain groups that they want to come out and endorsed you because it's a way you that you've voted but to you know have that it almost got to be a little bit careful that 'cause\nYou don't want to look as though you're beholden to these groups and you are when you play once you pledge to them it makes it a little bit difficult to say oh I'm just kidding I didn't mean to check that book so\nUm that's real important to me and again the Massachusetts corrections officer because I Am a huge um advocate of police fire first responders and anybody that puts their life out there to protect us\nEspecially the the corrections officers quoted job they have to do and how dangerous the job that they have to do it's a little bit hard when you're behind the same locked doors\nAnd I don't think people understand that all the time that they have to auction actually walking the beat if you would with some of the most dangerous people in the state of Massachusetts so that that's important to endorse\nNo the other things that a lot of times um you've got thrown a lot of talk\nThe other things that a lot of times um you've got a ... a lot of talk in the city um number one okay you're highly country club is this huge\nOr the other thing is I'm about the ah the recreational marijuana um where do you stand on then I Know there is there a couple of items places now I'm a ... that are going to be opened up down the line there's a place up on on the boulevard it's going to be opening up and down the line if they get their their permit\nUm how is how is that affecting the city you know\nYeah I think that you have to be very very careful and I said this to get time and time again again this was something that came out in my committee zoning and land use and we were able to get the first\nPermanent here in the city of ... now you know people have to understand that this was a guest state for marijuana and in particular Al Gore was a guest city meaning that they were OK with having marijuana here\nBut it's a group as a council we all felt that's okay it's our job to uphold what the people want but we need to do in the safest way that we possibly can\nOne of the other things is that once these things get going there is a lot of money that can be coming to the city for a lot of just you know for a lot of different things that we need here in the city\nBut I'm going to equate this to the casino the casino money and the tax money that Congress has to be targeted is supposed to be targeting some mitigation\nYou know it's a very interesting we say hey we're going to bring this we know that there's some collateral damage if you would that's caused by some of these types of things we don't want to see that happen so I don't know if people are aware of this but\nThese particular groups that are coming in are required to target some of their money to some social services and I think that's a I think that's the way it should be done so I think it's very important also that when this tax money does come in when we start to generate it that this these days\nIt and also that when this tax money does come in when we start to generate it that this these dollars do get moved in a certain direction to help the city but also to to serve the purpose that they were meant to serve which is to help support some of the social service\nOne of the original agreements that I helped to work on I asked that we that we find in other police officer I just thought bats they go hand in hand and I hope that when this does come through that the mayor continues to utilize that agreement and uphold that cream it the way it was fine because I think\nIs right Julie once again thank you so much thank you and thanks for having good luck [laughter]\nAll right Paul coming your way and just a couple of moments where out of here now and we'll be doing all

A. radio dot com right off the bat or joining us is a ... you were a Buddhist none is that correct that's correct to um where did you grow up I grew up in Los Angeles California Los Angeles California\nThere spirituality in Los Angeles California yeah but I met in New York City oh my God [laughter] if there's one place in the country where there's less spirituality than LA would be New York so good for you on your spiritual journey finding it they're of all places [noise] wow [noise]\nUm what brings you to this area\nWell I was actually asked to become the rising teacher at a meditation center in Providence Rhode Island called ... center\nA teacher cut down ... okay a teacher could top a Buddhist center\nOkay and basically what we do there is nothing at a normal\n[laughter] we actually Young Frankenstein reference right out of bed and said\nI won't let me do you look at our minds look at the state of mind that disturbed rice like anger and jealousy and how can we transform them with my ... states in line like\nDallas see and how can we transform them with more positive states in mind like love or be happy for people instead of jealous you know how do we do that\nSo some people have natural inclination is to doing that mother people don't and sometimes we have strong tendencies in one direction of being positive and strong tendency to being negative\nAnd hold on hold on for does that describe me in some ways I'm very very positive but in other ways it's a real difficult for me to get beyond the negativity in the negative emotions yet but um [noise] some choices others make\nWell and there is a key right there it's others yeah we're always pointing the finger outward forgetting are three fingers pointing back Paul\nYes well you know there's two ways to feel good about yourself oh one want us to step on someone you feel taller everything looks better that that's a great short term solution to better long term solution is actually helping someone up\nUm and I I'd like to think I'm often try to help people up I think I Do not as much as I should though well\nThat's I think the key right there I think everybody does that people help all the time but how do we generated and maintain it that's what we're looking at so if let's say you're in a crabby mood one morning and you don't feel like being nice how can you be nice to you make it\nIt's more than ... your understanding methods of how you can change your perception higher perceiving yourself and others so it's a genuine shit it's not like distorted slapping on a happy\nFace and pretending you're happy it's really come from your heart because it's a genuine perspective that is giving you that I'm a real happiness that inner peace\nOkay um before we get into a more specific information about you and the U.S or meditation services and things are offering in the area or let's talk a little bit uh generally\nSocial services and things are offering in the area or let's talk a little bit more generally about Buddhism yes and I know you want her to cover so many misconceptions of Buddhism\nUm did booth to have a drinking problem because he has one heck of a big beer belly almost good enough to qualify for residency Milwaukee or Chicago um what's the deal with that\nOkay we'll do do that today is actually um see I don't think I don't know a lot about that but they were worried the origin of that but as in China okay and so actually all of Buddhism comes from a\nA great but a name but a shocking Mooney okay and um but it's shocking Mooney we're looking at um [noise]\nYou know born in about you know five hundred and fifty B. C. okay um ... he was a prince maybe you read the book print suddarth just yet so that's the origin of old Buddhism is Buddha shocking Mooney or when he was a prince he actually realize that\nUm is worldly pleasures in the palace weren't going to give them the real deal meaning the real happiness that he wanted and also he saw that other people could find the real happiness and they want it and everybody without choice had to suffer so without choice\nI don't care how many acronyms you've got after your name your we have to get old\nWe have to get sick and we have to die and then now ... this is where I'm sure we'll get lots of questions when I'm about to say we're going to be born again\nOkay so there's rebirth in Buddhism we believe that this isn't I'm just one time around\nWe believe that we can't find the beginning of our mental continuum because our brain is a piece of furniture in the house of our body um our mind is a guest in that house um and so since we can't find the beginning of our mental continue our mind [laughter]\nWe can't find the beginning of our mental continue our mind we believe that we've had countless past lifetimes and therefore we will also have countless future lifetimes\nCry so is it a big circle or is it a big long straight line\nYou're listening to pontificate him with Paul and the ... on AM Thirteen twenty W.

and and\nI never wanted ... men ...\nUp welcome back to pontificate with Paul Andy ... speaking about serenity and inner happiness\nBut made me think of cat Stevens even though he's more of the Islamic tradition any Buddhist tradition but love is a good thing right Cokie absolutely we're here with gang of ... saying\nJokey a a Buddhist none are operating out of Providence Massachusetts how long have you been able to ... well actually it's Providence Rhode Island is Rhode Island while right hold on my bill [noise]\nWe bring that whenever I make a mistake as one caller from Rhode Island said my gosh I hear that stupid below my sleep but I Can't help myself um how long have you been ...\nI've been on a American but it's nice for eleven years and just cutting back agent was agent can ah sixty nine sixty nine you question whether I date yes don't unlike a Catholic night okay so I don't date I'm not\nMarried kids with rulers are there are no good answer that's the only difference between me and kind of like a guy in a Catholic but I went to Catholic school\nDid you yeah and you've overcome that quite well hoops I kidding okay that's one of my favorite things about the Catholic Church is there are the Catholic school education which is pretty darn good and well rounded um we could get her to criticisms of the church but we're not here for that\nIt's pretty darn groups and well rounded um we could get her to criticisms of the truth but without here for the um but ah so fun is not a sin in Buddhism or you don't do\nWell or just celibacy part of that as well which are Catholic one yes okay that I Apologize for the earlier mentioning about flipping through the swim wearing lingerie structure but she was catalog but we can move on from there\nI'm\nSoaked eleven years so you're going to know is there training for that or just snap your fingers and say I'm a no no\nNo there's actual training so I actually was um living and studying at our ... center I'm called K. and see New York meditation center in New York it was a beautiful traditional ... temple that's they're\nDedicated world peace eighty two acres of land it's absolutely spectacular\nAnd I lived there for five years and during that time I was trained so in our tradition we've got general program so what we do an adult burrow on Wednesday mornings is general program anyone can drop and\nYou can be Christian Catholic Jewish we're not trying to convert then it'd be more like you know what I like this sort of thing I actually want to go deeper and I want to explore it more and I might even want to be a Buddhist so\nUm [noise] people go deeper into what we call foundation programs so I Do that in Providence Rhode Island on Monday nights and then Sunday in Worcester mass to metal assets yeah\nAnd then um we'd go can leave a deeper teacher training programs I Want to teach these teachings and so I was on a teacher training program at a came to New York and I get on the deck young with my teacher and I you know realized after training that I I wanted to make a commitment\nAnd um it was after long retreat I had done and so I request her and she asked me to be an undercover none oh yeah because I said when I look at MIT\nRequest there and she asked me to be an undercover none oh yeah because I said when I look at ... covered Under Cover non for one year okay so I dress like we all do normally and then by cats devising commitments of a non for one year and then she said come back and see me in a year and I did\nAnd it was the best year my life and so that was twelve years ago\nNow I'm just can Buddhism or work in concert with other religions or do you have to know the other ones you know so you know most which was still OK Jesus was too old to Confucius there's still one of the good guys\nEverybody's good and and to be honest with you in today's world where we're just pulling out guns and shooting each other I think if anyone has any faith\nBeautiful mhm and we respect as Buddhist we respect other people's faith it doesn't make that I put my faith in God I respect people who put their faith in God you know my mother does and I respect my mother and so I think it's important that we understand that we can be different but respect each other ... when\nYou told your mother you were interested in becoming a Buddhist none was a oh a spiritual journey how lovely or was it oh my God all of our gone wrong you've turned drew back of the Catholic\nChurch that was the ladder\n[laughter] you know I grew up Catholic went to Catholic school you know um\nBut actually interesting enough met these teachings in eastern religion class in a Catholic college off which one was a Dominican college in center fell California and then um yeah I realized that all the questions I was sort of asking the priests throughout my life for answer it through Buddhism\nLike what happened is really when we die why do bad things happen to the people why do good things having to bad people write all these questions\nJim first on me was the records show wow\nAll these questions gym for what the records show\nWhile agency should not have another question how to watch the positive with all the negative things around me just a very good question agent sixty nine because it it it peels right now to us that there's so much negativity that the world is falling apart and on some level it appears this is true\nBut what's interesting as we can just change our perspective of how our viewing ourself and others so for example instead of focusing\nWith inappropriate attention and building up for example what's happening and we think it's wrong and it's bad and it's you know we we focus on things outwardly instead of looking at will help maybe how do I do that we call it the mirror of ... so when we see things that are negative\nWe we hold a mirror within well how do I lie how do I um\nMaybe a get angry at people and allow my temper to go wild\nAnd we start reflecting on on our own behavior it's kind of like putting your own oxygen mask on before assisting others so it's important understanding with Buddhism all we're doing is shifting to things I call it a daily ivy rash shifting our intention which is to benefit others and our view\nAnd our view is really looking at getting off of just self and how we exaggerate negativity like our um bad qualities of people you know how you can focus on seven bad ... exaggerate worse bigger and you forget about their good qualities\nAnd the same being with a one called desires attachment you just focusing on their good qualities you're the best year that and we start using your ... and then we exaggerate ... and then what happens is it gets very sticky doesn't it with attachment you're so what we look at our our three poisons in Buddhism\nOr anger or hatred or attachment\nAn ignorance okay ... ...\nOr hatred or attachment and ignorance\nOkay 'cause anger and hatred that basically um affects the hate her more than they hate e it has no effect on the Haiti unless of course you take part in a violent act but it can eat the hater alive from the inside out\nI Would say ... to everybody because thoughts are powerful so and do it if we don't believe our brain is our mind we believe are mine is located in the center of our tax that has no shape now coloring outside like\nIf you wanted to go home and your mind right now you could ... like if you wanted to go to the moon right now with your mind you could it's stopped it\nOkay so that's more or less the mind you're making them I sound like soul there\nWell you can call it a so we call it a mental continue on and that kind of technical them um but there's different levels of our mind as well so we look at the different ... levels of our mind understand how they can train our mind\nOkay we'll training our mind that's going to lead us into meditation and uh you can uh how's your card says here joined us each week as we explore Buddhist teachings and meditation tools\nTo solve our human problems cultivate peace in our hearts and live life to the fullest you drop in classes no experience necessary ever wants welcome there Wednesday mornings\nNine thirty ten am do you have this show on in the background during the meditation where that would be counterproductive wouldn't yeah\nOr at the Mason building five Twenty one mount hope street second floor in ... Massachusetts which leads to a question from agent sixty one what is meditation and why do it\nOkay good question can I put ... the bell on now on the ... are ... that problem with our car not you know okay when the first four oh [laughter]\nI just read your credibility interview or you're not going to give me factual information while anyway first floor at the Mason building five Twenty one ...\nThere's no place we can point to where my thought is right we think will point to our brains hanging while I'm I'm thinking this but where you know exactly so um yeah and and it's constantly changing by the way Paul your thoughts are if you check the way you were thinking in the morning is completely different the way you're thinking right now\nWell that's because of her ... her woke up first thing in the morning and no charges or whether to go I'm Asian Fifteen writes in what are the repercussions for not being positive or living a Buddhist large and\nShe'll again I'm not here to say you have to be a Buddhist or live a Buddhist life but if you check agents Fifteen ... if you don't\nThen basically you're going to suffer\nI mean it's that simple so if you lie and you cheat and you engage in hurtful speech then guess what you're going to suffer because of those actions and sometimes we'll experience there the you know\nFor because of those actions and sometimes we'll experience there the you know effects of that quickly and sometimes we don't end to this is what is a little bit tricky is that sometimes it takes time for those um potentials to ripen in fact lifetimes yeah yeah\nAnd sometimes you're going to send to the president's even United States with all those negative thoughts and emotions um agents sixty one I guess we didn't give them a complete after when the uh what is meditation why do we do it so it was meant so meditation as NATO So meditation not all about having a silent mind\nWe're experiencing a constant bliss what's the goal of meditation so you're running around so you don't walk down the street you skip down the street because you're happy all the time or is it more of a peaceful state\nOkay so you walk slowly you ought to Russian you don't elbow people out of the ...\n... I think there's different levels in which we can approach um there's ... some people just don't want to yell at the kids so much so we can learn tools on on patient acceptance okay [noise] um some people want to have better relationships with their partner and so we can look at um the loving kindness meditations\nOn some people actually don't want to continue to suffer period [laughter] they want to break what we call this NPR cycle ... where we all have to be born get will get sick and die impact and capture things we don't like right get our wishes unfulfilled and be separated without choice would love to be with our loved ones\nTo some people want to break that cycle and that's called liberation\nSo we can train our mind\nFrom not just liberation but enlightenment submitted became an enlightened being through meditation\nHe'll walk an inner light of wisdom alright how things really are versus how they appear\nNow you have weekly meditation classes in Providence that'll borrow and for a well healed citizens and little Compton Rhode Island and\nAdel borrow and for a well healed citizens and little Compton Rhode Island and then also a good old blue collar friends in Worcester, Massachusetts so all spectrum of society um\nAnd uh well we can give it a whole Tuesday night or in Providence will act actually almost every Tuesday Wednesday Thursday nights Sunday mornings as well on Sunday mornings kids and family are welcome as well how do you have the meditate when those rotten little Crump crushers are bouncing all over the walls\nYou would be surprised on we we've got a kitten family together and it's so beautiful to see seven year olds nine year old ten year olds we had a lot of boys ...\nLooking at how they can view their world in a different way\nAnd um it's not about being silent with medication it's about a year of and you can contemplate I think we all know how to contemplate mhm um and and what we did we kind of late and we were focusing our mind virtuous object to that virtuous object is looking at how\nWe can look at the downfall of the anger and look at the benefits of patient acceptance okay\nUh we're speaking to a ... a Buddhist non everything you want to know about Buddhism but were afraid to ask I'm gonna ask you to put on the headphones their underneath the desk thirty right\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da da in combination but phone calls Gulf come first so let's go to the phone lines at five oh wait two to one three to zero good morning\nOr good morning either what's your name where you calling from\nI'm Phyllis McGuire one of the original McGuire Sisters\nAre there it is [laughter] hello Dave good thank you [laughter]\nHello um what is it proper\nDifficulty showcase\nI guess you could you could tell the\nJoke a good thing um\nI my question and listen I've only had a chance that it's because I Try not to listen to the show you understood\nYeah oh [laughter] okay this is Dave King he's the up of Rhode Island radio legend some southern New England radio legend and host of king and company every Saturday morning nine AM 'til noon right here on Thirteen twenty there'll be way alright yeah I Would\nNever never never never ... or ... I'm\nA junkie um I wanted to ask you how much and and and the frustration comes you think when people thinking there they are somehow are in control of their life or in control of what should happen\nAnd know what should happen to somebody and what it should happen is separate does that isn't that that\nThat trauma go a lot to make the people that have happened\nOh absolutely because we're sending our separate that expectation currently we're expecting people to be have an act in a certain way that we want right and because of that expectation when they don't wear upset\nAnd of course no one can live up to our expectations expectations are a huge\nThing including ourselves including our sound you're I I Would say most people are their worst enemy\nYeah why did you look me right straight you know when you said that you're talking about their children to do it for you know [laughter]\nUm\nSo so anyway what that was the thing that I have found is that people really just don't get it they think that they're in charge and they think that they can do anything or anything they think it was supposed to have\nIts right we have about one percent controlling next journals that we have an opportunity to be a hundred percent control over our mind and that's what we did for medication we moved to train our mind so that no matter what\nMind and that's what we did her medication we learn to train our mind so that no matter what's happening externally we can keep a peaceful mind\nAnd part of that is it not true that part of that is that when something terrible happens to us we can make the choice to accept it and then move on to work to to make good something good come from it rather than to be a victim of the ...\nOh absolutely but that's that's challenging too because it depends on on what that circumstances I mean some people encounter horrible things like I don't know about if you're a parent or not but\nI have is a parent who has encountered horrible things on his son was the youngest victim of the station nightclub fire and Davis turn that horrible event into a a a positive any strides every day at least in my opinion to do that as your pool\nTo end that I Would say you encounter when I was just going to say is probably the most horrific pain any parent can encounter\nWell here's the thing about you know there was another young boy and his mother um\nIsn't hell jokey his mother\nA saying how dare got take my son from me you know a lot of children die a lot of people die every day a lot of people showing everyday this woman the message I was really getting from her was how God how's the guy do this to me take my trials\nYeah you know ... and completely missing everything\nYeah well and she's in hell though of course of\nAnd and and that's what we do we create our house through our mind there is no how outside our mind and so when we come to understand that we can create whatever we want with our mind didn't we harness the power and potential of our mind and and we do this through meditation because we need to observe and we need to know what methods\nSome of our mind and and we do this through meditation because we need to observe and we need to know what methods to use in order to harness that potential\nAlleged ...

obviously because this is the business or careers and business radio show\nI also go that I have is also to give you a little bit of perspective on current events\nAnd how things are kind of moving and to give you a sense for your place in the world I Know many of us feel like just the world is going past us and and we we are no consequences but I'm telling you you certainly are consequences you just never know when destiny is\nTelling you you certainly are of consequences you just never know when destiny is going to win search you in a certain situation where you have to make a decision that has impact on not just your life but on perhaps scores thousands even millions of lives\nWe are living in these moments where the tiniest decisions or the tiniest missteps can just be an absolute disaster for for the world at large and and a boy I'll tell you I'm I'm In and sometimes that come into the show I mean a great mood other tight not time to come to the show\nAnd I'm In a bad mood other days that come into the show and I'm In kind of a guinea mood um I think it depends on what I drink before I come on the show um a couple of weeks ago I was talking so fast\nAnd it was because I had a big big a drink of Coca Cola Diet Coke is like my favorite beverage\nI drink I think a little bit way too much and I'm In I was just talking too fast I was thinking too fast I I I it was not a pleasant feeling\nSince then I've significantly significantly cut my caffeine consumption and so I've been drinking more seltzer water and I'm more hot chocolate still drinking a little bit of coffee but I'm tape bring that down\nSo that in about another two weeks or so um I'll have kick that habit I shared with this I should this with the radio on ... audience last week\nThat I went to a religious retreat and in that religious retreat\nThere was no no coffee was served I mean it's just one of those deals that this is the faith that doesn't believe in uh in stimulants are serving them so no coffee um some ... definitely no no sodas that have caffeine in them\nSo after a weekend my was hounding I felt like a like a heroin addict looking to get his next fix\nThat's when I realized you know what I don't like anything being in control\nHis next fix that's when I realized you know what I don't like anything being can control of my body I don't like people being in control of my life and I don't like products being being in control my body\nSo I put myself on a plan to just kick the habit slowly I I Wish I could do it cold turkey I I'm not that kind of a I don't have that kind of personality and quite frankly we're not talking about her when we're talking about caffeine so I'm I'm Down to three quarters of a cup of coffee\nDown from about two to three cups so that's not too bad um so what do I get kind of what's the flip side of not drinking coffee well sometimes I feel tired um and ah drinking hot chocolate I think the sugar and it gives me a bit of a rush that I don't like so\nBut these kinds of behaviors go along with being part of a civilized\nSociety what we can do is find those who are responsible and made out appropriate punishment but retain the alliance correct that behaviors\nAnd it's meant to retain the alliance\nCorrect that behaviors don't reward China and Russia for a stupid thing and a misstep that the Saudis did but they ... they did

realized that this is called the careers in business radio show up what we sure do short do a lot of political talk\nAnd I do that for a reason many times many of us will rely on one or two media outlets to give US News\nWhat I'm trying to do a straddle both media outlets\nThe CNN to the world the Fox news of the world's the bright parts of the world the Drudge Report to the world each of those sites they do have an agenda and they do have a desire to sway public opinion\nTo sway public opinion\nWe don't have too many [noise]\nYour and unbiased media outlets\nIt's really hard to find actual news without a slant and so my goal is to try to provide you with with that\nMost of the time I'm going to have good news at this in this segment other times I'm going to have not so great news and today it's one of those days where\nThe news is kind of good and it's kind of bad at the same time\nFor those of you who haven't been to New York recently took a walk down a down Madison Avenue uh and uh see what you see you don't see every store front open you don't see a lot of a collective little coffee shops\nYou don't see a lot of uh\nBusinesses restaurants that have been open for you know seven generations um\nIt's getting really hard to find a decent bagel and even to get a decent slice of pizza\nBut if you're looking for your next a job I hit a from Starbucks or you want to go and purchase um something at a local CBS um that's getting easier to find a New York city\nSadly New York city is becoming like Cleveland, Ohio and like um Indianapolis, Indiana Columbus I mean those are all great cities believe me I I I like going to those cities\nBut those cities are so shall I say the word generic that it's kind of sometimes it's hard to tell whether you're in Cleveland or you're in Omaha or you're in Raleigh Durham ... the city's all look the same the businesses I mean there's a Starbucks in downtown there's uh\nBut the cities all look the same the businesses I mean there's a Starbucks in downtown there's a there's a Dwayne Reed\nThere's a a CBS all again all great businesses and they deserve the right to to go in there but when they're willing to pay such exorbitant rents in order to establish a position and they just take up their prices and that causes the um the the small mom and pop business\nTo um to go away that makes me really sad\nBecause New York is a city of a thousand neighborhoods and each paper has its own little little panache his own little\nUm character and I remember when I was a kid in Brooklyn there was a pizzeria and and you know when you're a kid you kinda see things differently\nBut whenever we drive past this pizzeria it was almost as if I could hear heavenly angels ex claiming a rival to this pizzeria 'cause usually when we were getting close it's because we're going to that pizzeria to eat it was that good I could hear the angels going oh\nAnd then was almost as if the street lights were shining directly on the pizzeria and I still I mean this this is almost fifty years ago I still remember the color of the neon sign on the window\nThat's had pizza pizza pizza\n[laughter] [noise]\nThat it was run by an old Italian guy who probably got it from his father he spoke good English I mean he was a New Yorker but you could tell you could definitely tell he was a tally in and of course he did not have a shirt it was a T shirt one of those um vena T shirt so you could see a little bit too much\nIt was a T shirt one of those um vena T shirt so you could see a little bit too much a chest here [noise]\nAnd he would for all that pizza up in the air and catch it and he did not have gloves on it was all done in and and I never saw him wash his hands from the time he collected your money to the time he went back and and you get some more do [noise]\nIt was the most delicious pizza I've ever had in my life and I still remember how it tastes and I missed that pizza\nThat was the character of New York city at the time and that was duplicated a thousand times throughout the city so when you want the Chinatown you would eat real Chinese food made from real Chinese ingredients by real Chinese people [noise]\n... little Italy if you wanted to know it would be a ... that you could find you could get on a jet plane go to Naples in and ask for ... it would be the exact same ...\nYou could go to a little gray she could go to little um little Puerto Rico I guess a little I don't think it was a little Cuba or you could go to all these little neighborhoods are Harlem of course and get the best\nThe best chitlins that that that could be found anywhere north of the Mason Dixon Line it would be exactly the same as what you could find back home and then all of these other foreign restaurants French restaurants at how\nThese were this was this was New York it was it was a quilt there was a ... company it was it was a monster headache of sights and sounds and smells and languages\nAnd when you take and you can modify the neighborhoods and now new Manhattan has become the ghost town of ... million dollar apartments and CVS pharmacies we've lost something when that happens we've lost something\nWe've lost something when that happens we've lost something I Do not ... there's a town in in Hawaii it's called ...\n[noise] when I was when I was in Hawaii and when I felt like like home sick for the u._s.

I work with a devout Muslim and actually to devout Muslims and we talk about God had we agree that we agree that a law Akbar\nWhich means God is great they worship their way I Wish it my way I respect their faith and their search for truth\nAnd for their place in the world and and how they may be of service to God on this earth why is that such a threat to the Chinese government I Will tell you why\nThe reason why is a threat to the Chinese government is because\nWhen you supplant government with God government is threatened because a government that wants you to worship it cannot coexist with a God this is my fundamental\nIssue with the with communism communism by its very nature\nIs atheist there is no room\nIn a communist system for believers because your dedication your devotion and your worship should be to the state to state supersedes everything and the state is always right\nGod Forbid that such a thing should happen in this country but we dodged the bullet ladies and gentlemen\nThings that happened in this country but we dodged a bullet ladies and gentlemen and I am confident that our religious liberties are assured at least for the next Twenty years\nSo that if I Wish to wash the way I Do and I wish to exercise um my religious exercise judgment or make decisions based on my religious preferences than than my decisions will be respected\nSo we have an issue I have an issue with the Chinese government simply because faith people are persecuted we fought this war over religion we continue to fight this war over religion\nI'm sick and tired of fighting over religion just let us as humans worship are God or God's in peace and government stay out of our business I'll be right back\nBrown University who hosts the lecture cosmic shadows other worlds in fifth dimension on Thursday November aid from four to five thirty PM shadow ... patterns are cast throughout the universe by the gravitational field the stars and galaxies this talk will unveil how these cosmic shuttles carry clues about the existence of extra solar planets\nAnd a possible fifth dimension the auditorium will open at three thirty PM proceeding and guess are asked to arrive at the auditorium no later than three fifty PM the lecture will take place at Brown university's ICU Ahram one Twenty one south main street on the eleventh floor [noise]\nMan hours later I can talk for a long time\nI think the same [noise]\nAnything they want to get the gas [noise]\nI like getting like\nI don't like I Am I hearing everyone out [noise] so I don't think I had in\nMind I think again and\nAgain like licking pay money I made me feel uncomfortable and\nI make terms of the little things like when my young young men\nCan paint over and over\nAnd told one game and\nFamily got me out slowly I learned how to live on\nYou can see signs of autism and children as young an Eighteen month\nEarly intervention can make a lifetime of difference Mm\nLearn to sign an object and speaks dot org slash lines run you buy onto the beach and the ad council\nOr are you looking for more opportunity the literacy center is here to help we have free year round classes in English computer literacy and high school equivalency with the help of teachers and tutors you can prepare for your citizenship test\nMake a resume get ready for college or learn how to speak better English classes held during the day evening or on Saturdays\nViewer website the literacy centered dot com or call five oh wait\nTwo to six three six oh three the literacy center building a better community shove\nDon you're listening to reason business videos show with their host Jay Roman [noise]\nAnd\nDo\nThis job in show\nI work in your own or\n\nWe're here you know or ...\n[laughter] this is the ...

A. M. Thirteen twenty so back to our talk about having a good interview preparing for an interview and what I've done in the past to prepare for an interview and I have I have a my ... my share of interviews proud to say and it's because I prepare\nNine times out of ten when a cat it prepares they're already out or at an at an advantage and you don't have to be better\nOr at an at an advantage and you don't have to be better than fifty people you just have to be better than the guy right behind you like to sit the second guy\nAnd if you can do that the job is yours and so I always have a little portfolio I have if I apply for a job I print out the the job wreck or the the job itself\nAnd I put it in a folder job of apply to so that way when I got a call and you know you'll get calls from recruiters out of the blue you're you're sitting there having your morning coffee or you're in your Japanese at nine thirty in the morning because you're unemployed and all of a sudden you get a call from you know the area maybe an eight hundred number [noise]\nHi this is John from you know X Y Z Corporation I'm calling because you apply for a job and what I Do is I Am you say oh John from ... corporation a one moment let me let me put on my headphones so that way um I couldn't reach for things and and their understanding and while there a while I'm making pretend I'm putting on a headphone are putting on a headphone I'm flipping through my\nMy uh my file of jobs hopefully it's not too many um and if they are then I had them alphabetized\nAnd I flipped through Oh yes XYZ corporation yeah I applied for the uh for the uh operations manager position the guy goes oh yeah that's exactly the job good good so you you know they're not you thought you know about the job that I'm calling about and I say absolutely um\nAnd then we have a conversation about the job I've got the job posting right there I've already kind of done my work\nUm if and and that way if I can kind of sneak on the computer and very quietly type this is the tricky part as you don't want to you don't want them to hear you're typing\nBecause they may think you're distracted and not paying attention and and people will get upset but what you can do is you can type very quietly I mean uh let me know if if you can hear me typing now probably a little bit but you know I'm I'm typing something on my computer\nProbably a little bit but you know I'm I'm typing something on my computer as I'm speaking with you because what I'm doing is I'm looking up your name on linked in to see if I can find you [noise]\nBut there was nothing I Would love more than to get a call from someone who said Henry I listen to your advice and that kind of chopping him making thirty five percent more than I was in my previous job\nBecause my next responses it'd be great I Want you to write a check for ten percent of your first week salary to a nonprofit of my choice and um my nonprofit of choices advertise disaster relief\nOr it's one of my favorite um [noise] favorite charities they do they do wonderful work around the world\nSo today I'm going to talk about for this segment and talk about investing and medals how is it\nThat you can become rich well there's only a couple of ways that you can become rich there's only one way you can become rich and that's to make a heck of a lot more money than what you ... than than what you spend um you can also become rich by making a lot of money and spending a lot of money\nUm you can also become rich by making a lot of money and spending a lot of money but you're not going to stay rich unfortunately\nEven people who have earned ... billion dollars over their lifetimes have had become have gone bankrupt a case in point Mike Tyson a billion dollars earned over his career\nAnd he declared bankruptcy because he owed more than what he had he had more deaths than he had um [noise] then he had a assets that bankruptcy\nSo I Want you to develop a plan so that you can accumulate wealth and there are several ways of of accumulating wealth\nThe first way to accumulate wealth is obviously to save more than what you spend I mean it doesn't have to be that you say fifty thousand dollars a year you can say five thousand a year you could say five hundred a year for fifty years\nAnd at the end of that time you'll have a tidy I'm tiny chunk of change especially if you invested that is how you create wealth is that you take money and you invested so that that money spins off extra money for you know traditionally it's been through the stock market\nAnd we talked about how to uh you know like the stock market is I think I'm going to do another show about the stock market later on and actually give you step by step some on how to actually develop are actually get a stock account [noise]\nInvest it and start trading stock so I'm going to walk you through the whole process I'm actually going to go through it step by step click click on the computer I think that'll be fun [noise]\nUm [noise] excuse me [noise] so that's one way you buy stocks low you sell high or you buy stocks low\nAnd that stock generates a dividend which is basically interest and then you take that dividend and you re invested in that stock or other stocks and your portfolio gross or you can buy a business or you could start a business\nAnd that business generates a you know\nCan buy a business or you could start a business and that business generates a you know cash\nThese are the ways that that you that you accumulate wealth well once you start accumulating wealth what do you do with this well from what one option that you have is to buy precious metals now and and precious metals are gold silver can also be palladium platinum\nUm copper is not a precious metal but you can buy copper a copper is a tradable commodity you can buy it and then you can sell it\nUm same thing with gold and silver these are all um items that can be bought and sold\nI'm not as easily as other commodities but um there are there are some people I I'm not one of them most of the time [noise]\nBut there's some people who say that there's going to be a collapsed civilization and went civilization collapses fear currency which is most most of them money that's out there like American money here and I think the European money yeah most most currencies are ... countries which means that\nUm they are only as valuable as what people think they are\nSo if the dollar collapses of the government collapses or we can't pay our Twenty one trillion dollar ... trillion dollar debt [noise]\nUm and the dollars valley collapse as all of a sudden you you get hyper inflation which is happening in these countries like um like poor Venezuela where their inflation rate is is this a staggering I mean I Can't even fathom what uh five thousand percent inflation rate looks like I saw a picture\nOf the amount of currency the boulevards that was required to purchase a basic like chicken you know like a plucked chicken chicken or costs you I think six bucks um or maybe maybe eight bucks at your local stop and shop\nOn the ticket look one day I'm going to stop by store and see what a chicken cause in Columbia costs three million\nThe store and see what a chicken cause in Columbia costs three million boulevards and the stacks of cash actually I'm covered you couldn't see the chicken because of the wall of cash that was that was piled in front of it\nThat was required to purchase chicken so if we have a an inflationary event like that your money is going to become worthless basically\nImagine if you are the value of your currency drops a hundred percent a week that means that if you have ten thousand that let's say a hundred thousand make it easy for me you have a hundred thousand dollars and in your account right let's say you're done well in your four one K. has five hundred thousand dollars sitting pretty right\nThe value of your ... he goes on a hundred percent in a week that means it's not worth two hundred fifty thousand the next week it's worth a hundred twenty five thousand a week after that's worth um [noise] a seven to sixty five thousand let's say\nI'm the week after that it's worth thirty two thousand a week after that it's worth sixteen thousand week after that it's worth eight thousand and two months you're five hundred thousand dollar portfolio is worth a thousand dollars\nAnd that keeps going down\nThe good thing about having precious metals is precious metals are called whoa what does that term I I have to look it up on the Web it's called a\nUm\n[noise] oh dear I forget the ... there's a special none of that there's a specific word it preserves that's of value basically so even with inflation if you've purchased gold at a thousand dollars and inflation goes up a hundred percent you're gold is going to be worse\nInflation goes up a hundred percent you're gold is going to be worth\nUm if it was worth a thousand dollars and that was a hundred percent inflation your goal is going to be worth two thousand dollars in terms of purchasing power you'll be able to purchase\nTwo thousand dollars worth of goods um if inflation continues to increase\nThe value or the purchasing power of gold remains a steady stable relative to you know the items that you want to purchase whereas with cash there's an inverse relationship in um with a with inflation\nSo gold is used as a inflationary hatch um and that's what it's that's what it's called so that way if if everything goes to hell in a hand basket pardon my French than you can use goal to trade for um the items that you need a friend of mine who's a\nWho's a real proper [laughter] he's a crazy guy I Love 'em but he's he's one of these kind of you know the I mean he's ... he's the guy but you know what he's a friend of mine and I tend to keep my friendship with them because if if civilizations collapse he's going to be someone I definitely need to be good friends with because he's going to help me survive and my family [noise]\nUm but he says that you know there are other commodities that there are also tradable and he says what are the most valuable commodities when not just beat silver and gold it'll be bullets\nAmmunition ammunition will be able to buy you the things that you need a you know a a box of bullets will buy you a meal for your entire family for example um so the box of bullets has purchasing power no I'm not telling you to arm up and and start sucking away ammunition but I'm saying is that\nHaving a strategy a hedge against a in unforeseen event is not a bad idea [noise]\nSo if you have a portfolio and and your diversifying its very smart to have your money in a four okay but don't put all your eggs in one basket that's that's not good and I don't\nI it's very smart to have your money and a four okay but don't put all your eggs in one basket that's that's not good and I don't recommend that but definitely have a four O. one K. definitely have your own a stock um purchasing a site you know use the ... traits of the world the ... there's lots of them will talk about that again a couple of weeks [noise]\nThere are the um [noise] uh there are these the sites the medals metal sites I use them in the I don't think I Want to tell you who I use\n'em but but I I use um the online sites to purchase a precious metals\nI purchased cold and I purchased silver I I I realize that there is also platinum and palladium and even a copper 'em and um there's even other metals that I'd never even heard of rodeo am I what is rodeo them up but there's a market for for ...\nUm but I stick to silver ethical because that's what I Know I'm sure that there is a market for ... our platinum\nBut I don't think that if times are so rough that I actually have to use gold and silver to trade I don't think it's gonna be anyone's going to be saying hey do you have any wrote him [laughter] thing but people will accept gold and silver and exchange so I have\nUm I Know I don't have bars of gold because I Can't afford them but I Do have gold coins um and I do have parts of silver um and I have a cold I mean I have silver um coins and then I have a kind of um instead of full ounces of goal to have smaller I'm a smaller coins\nAnd um by the way if you're thinking about robbing me no they're in a safety deposit box in the bank here in town so you're not to be able to get to them\nAnd you need to keys [laughter] to to gain access to them so it's not easy to to get to them [noise] um but it is important for you to have at least ten percent of your portfolio and precious metals and\nImportant for you to have at least ten percent of your portfolio and precious metals and if you don't want to put your your precious metals in a safety deposit box then by all means\nWhere there's a beautiful school they're southern southern university and um we've been friends since our Hawaii days\nAnd every time we've gone together since the Hawaii days we just have such a wonderful time and I will say some of my most precious memories are our memories that I've had with a brother Jim and sister Ellen\nAnd um I jokingly call them brought a gym and I tell them you're my brought up from one not murder [laughter]\nHe's a great guy I have so many memories of us being together there was one ... one memory that really comes to mind and that seems like some of my best memories of our of me being underwater somewhere [noise]\nBut we're in Hawaii and we're on his boat and um it's it's me and him and his wife and his\nAnd um it's it's me and him and his wife and his stepson Ellen's son who at a time was about Thirteen Years old\nAnd uh we're about five miles away from the shore of wine I so it's been pretty far though the short it definitely looks far we're definitely in like deep water 'cause Hawaii is you know all all the Hawaiian Islands are basically mountains that have done it up from from from the sea floor\nSo five miles out from the seashore daughters about a thousand feet deep I mean it's very deep water [noise]\nAnd uh so my my friend uh looks on horizon says Henry were unlock we've got a pot of dolphin looks like about a hundred of them coming our way go ahead and jumping the water so you can swim with them\nAnd my response than was are you crazy not going to jump in the water with with a with a hundred wild animals who happened to be carnivores [laughter]\nNo thank you and he says Henry this is the opportunity of a lifetime you you'll you'll regret it if you don't go in the water\nAnd I said I I I I don't care\nWhat you say I'm not going in the water he says to all these animals there used to humans and I said yeah and they probably would like the taste of human flesh too [laughter] and so I Am just absolutely adamantly against going into the water and swimming with these wild animals who eat meat at how sharp teeth [noise]\nAll of a sudden I hear splashing sound and it is his son in\nLaw Thirteen Years old I was just jumped into the water where the snorkel here on he's going to do a deep dive because he wants to swim with the with the dolphins I'd totally forgotten that that that the boy was there and he's a big boy but still he still boy's Thirteen Years old [noise]\nAnd so for the gym looks at me says you got to go in now can't leave you can't leave or my son went down there by himself\nI actually courage that [laughter]\nSelf [laughter] I actually ... and I'm not a ... but I held profanity at him as I put on my my ah my my\nMy flippers on and my mask and he is just laughing up a storm he thinks it's funny and meanwhile I'm the one that's going in the water with a hundred carnivores\nSo I splash into the water and I do a a inverted dive so I can go as deep as I can as quickly as I can and I turn around I'm In ... heads you know head up a in about\nThirty to forty feet of water pretty pretty pretty decent\nDive and [noise] my uh my my friend's son in law are steps on his is about thirty feet away from me and just as I turned around and kind of sided my my ah my friend's son in law that's when the dolphins show up a hundred of them majestic creatures\nSay blend into their environment in an incredibly well [noise]\nCouldn't really see them from a distance but as I got closer you could see their shapes up here in the water they were like they went from being silhouettes\nTo physical entities and the adults my friend was right by the gym was right the adults steered clear of us so they went around us and they gave us wide berth about maybe forty feet\nOf distance but the little dolphins they'd never seen humans before they were they were babies\nProbably I'd say I'm holding my hands apart right now um they were as long as maybe a foot a foot and a half and some of them were about maybe about maybe two feet long\nI mean these are a little tiny baby off the just the cutest little things you've ever seen and they swim right up to both my ah my friend's son steps on and my and myself and they had their their faces in front of my mask the work\nMyself and they had their their faces in front of my mask the were amazed to see me not to look at me they were so curious they what they want to know what I was\nI didn't look like a dolphin but I was in the water had bubbles coming out of my mouth so obviously I read there as well but I was my body long in the wrong way [noise] and then I Would I heard all this clicking around me but I heard a clicking that was louder than the other so it's a cough or any of clicks\nAnd um I don't know if I can reproduce it on the on the air [noise] kind of like that\nBut some of them are louder than others and when when these little dolphins heard a loud clicks they would go running off but I suspect is that the dolphins they were the mothers were behind me probably closer than I care to know\nAnd they were looking for the kids basically saying come along kids you know we gotta keep going we we've got a schedule to keep I guess [noise] and the little baby dolphins would would go off and eventually the pot swim past us [noise]\nI Would say I spent a total of maybe Ninety seconds in the water but that Ninety seconds was an eternity for me and I am so grateful to my friend for forcing me to go into the water because I have an experience that I have several times\nAnd every time people are amazed and and so a a U.S not to sound it but so enthralled by by by the story and I always put a religious twist to it as well because they are God's creatures\nAnd to see how perfectly these animals have are are living in their environment perfectly suited for an aquatic environment even though they're mammals [noise]\nI see the hand of God in in that and I'm so grateful\nI see the hand of God in in that and I'm so grateful that got put these friends of mine in my path\nSo that I can have these memories of spending time with them and it makes me realize that kind of to a much better job of reaching out to my other friends spending more time with them sharing time with them\nSo that when they have a wonderful experience with me and my family and they share it with others that this beautiful circle can come right back\nSo I spent some time with your friends share memories create memories with people whom you laugh because these are the things that just make life so very sweet we'll be right back\nBrown University who hosts the lecture cosmic shadows other world in a fifth dimension on Thursday November aid from four to five

want to put it on how store please give me a call also um there are plenty of old houses in outer borough but um it doesn't seem as though people are that apt to\nAllow us to use their houses as much as it used to be so sometimes it's tied getting houses but if anybody's interested give me a call\nAgain I mean that's exactly what we're here for the ... people know how how they can get involved in unity to help but you know to help\nHelp preserve because I mean we've all seen as young as we drive around New England there's some communities that really have gone all out and trying to preserve a everything and anything that the that they can um [noise]\nI Know that we had a you know some issues in the past you remember when we were talking about ... ah what did we caught historical rode\nThe scenic wrote on June ... wrote ordinance yeah that would that we batted around for years and years and years and years and I'm nodding off the council for for years as a as anything ever actually come of that as\nI Know we pretty well\nPut it aside let's say yeah I'm not sure whether they were about ... will come back or not but um it's just something that the Massachusetts historical commission suggested that local historical conditions use as a tool to preserve the history so that's why we wanted to try and get it on the books but there's just no way out all the time no it doesn't\nAnd unfortunately as time goes on to become fewer and fewer roads that probably sort of meet the criteria that\nFeeling through buildings we all we have to one of the things we strive for is to find new uses for old buildings and hearing about we've really done a good job with that you know there's a lot of buildings that have been a\nChange totally from what they were originally to you know like the sweet house the first mass houses literacy center you know the fire station is the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just these great new ...\n... the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just a great new uses for old buildings that need to remain standing and be a part of our heritage\nRight now and why not just like finding something to do with the building the good good musicians and it's it's making good utilization delivers the Senate building gets so much so much use and that's\nA good just building it really it really is and it's well built ... you know on they don't build 'em like they used to\nI think that's one of the kids are why a lot of the properties of survives over the years it was like they really were well built compared to some of the stuff we see today\nYup my house as strong as anything he go to bang bang a nail into those signs beams like anti ... and ... you been to nail over\n[laughter] that's pretty good\nI I mentioned one of the difficulties people have when they said they they buy it all the property like that and they want to stay with the historical seem ... make it seem timely it must be difficult sometimes to get materials and stuff that match up with the time Ira especially when you get further back\nThere's lots of businesses out there now that really concentrate on that and and not you know pride themselves and being available with all of restoration materials that you need and especially now that you are on line getting everything it doesn't matter where it is you can get it Mm well that's good to hear yeah oh yeah yeah\nSo what other activities besides the historical commissions society what other stuff have you been involved in over the years\nAnd I'm sure there's a lot of what I said I Belong to those two things but I also belong to DARE and we're very we're very very proud of our little pack house the Seventeen twenty three house on on the corner of Elizabeth and knocked me that's early and then my house\nIs now that that's basically it right across the CBS yes it is for people want the snow you want to talk about what about what the DARE some of the people out there might not be familiar with the organization DARE isn't\nWhat ... what's the DARE as some of the people out there might not be familiar with ...\nIs a a national organization and Arab rose chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started here in Massachusetts back in Nineteen oh one and uh it has to do with your genealogy mostly you have to prove that you are related to in a are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary war\nAnd uh you you have to go through all of the genealogy to prove that and then this what this this group does themselves as we try to preserve patriotism and we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we try to um\nPraise the students who are into history and that type of thing uh\nBut it's uh like I said it's a national organization\nThat's really written it and it's the ... and since Nineteen all one yes it has well that's a that's a long well established ... yes and no did you get involved with that when you first moved to the community\nIs again it was when I was trying to track the history of my house and so um that that was one of the groups that I joined also but I'm also a member of the ... museum I oil paint I don't know if everybody knows that HUD and I sell my paintings yet so I'm I Do oil paintings and um\nI can do them to order you've been anything all your life\nYou know I started hearing about the seventies and for ... the older folks that are watching this um maybe they remember either race either race was an art teacher here in ... and I took from her for ten years so um and I did things like on adult beds and and uh all the local things summer school at ... high and\nTwo for the ap courses that's really neat yeah and then I also belong to the triborough called that club [noise] oh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original member of the club started forty years ago this this year coming and\nThe original member of the clubs dotted forty years ago this this year coming and um we've got a Nineteen sixty two Corvette and we've had it for thirty eight years and we um\nWill start you know yeah Thirty years and um we like to go out and ride around in it and we've got a lot of a good friends and the core that club and it's great\nFun still you must get me a lot of people you know with all those shows and copy look good people\nThat's great yeah that's where it's no there any uh activities and the community that you've thought about getting involved with it maybe haven't yet had the time or\nI think I've really between my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight grandchildren and one and a half great grandbabies wow so um that takes up you know\nA lot of time to you and uh yeah so I think I'm actually involved in enough things with or without any more you\nKnow what and when you when you first moved out of ... and you interested in researching the history of your house um that led to getting involved in community activities but um I think today\nThere are a lot of people out there that I find it a little bit harder to get involved in the community there not quite you know the the lifestyles of so much busier they work out of town um you have a suggestion for people who are thinking about jihad us you know I'd like to get involved with something that\nKnow when you started to say that something went through my head and it was something that my chemistry teacher in high school said to me and I've never forgotten it you always find the time to do the things you really want to do [laughter]\nOkay so if somebody really wants to do it this so many things available in outer borough I mean there's a general allergy club at the library that does the YMCA has all these programs that library has a whole bunch of programs and then all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um\nEven even when you've worked at the factories this I I actually belong to the bell for retirees\nEven even when you've worked at the factories there's I I actually belong to the bell for retirees to the gold ... because I worked out for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in outer borough and you know if somebody really wants to do what they find a way so\nYou have any you know well is that people who\nAre saying they they think the city should do this the city should do that do you have any things that you you would like to see the city maybe trend to do more of that maybe we're not right now\nI think the city's doing pretty good I think everything looks terrific I like some of the um\nThe like the lamp posts I'd like the lamp post their their antique looking and and not brings back the character of the city that we we have had and and ah proof where we came from we have to know where we came from to know where we're going so\nWell absolutely especially I think in the holidays with the lights and I think it really does matter to a certain\nNew England homey feel kinda to it I'm One\nOf the things that you know we think about historical stuff in the city is one of the things I think of is like Cape and park\nYou know I mean they don't build and did they don't make parks like that anymore you know it's basically the ones that exist exist and it's unlikely that in the future they'll develop um but uh we saw recently there was this talk about um [noise]\nRenovating some of the monuments and there are as extensively one of the ... ah have you been involved in all of that or do you know anything you might be the ad about that that\nOne of the Memphis about commission is on that committee so that he is our liaison between it um it's it's a Beautiful Mind unit it's the most beautiful monument in the city and um it needs a lot of care and maintenance and um if they can raise the money to do it that would be great\nI can remember you know as a little kids you know forty years ago over the plane in the park\nYeah I can remember as a little kids you know forty years ago over the plane and the puck on the monument and you know I think it was sort of somewhat old and whether it's at that point in my own on it now I we don't really work which is probably what led to getting the condition um but but there are so many\nLittle things like that that a historical in a city that people don't necessarily think about but there are lots of monuments around and and and not to mention all the old burial ground since um [noise] oh wasn't it like the Bonneville who is involved a few years back and sort of documented
