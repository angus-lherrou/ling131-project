{"month": "11", "state": "MA", "station": "WARA", "content": "He ends up dying and um this is kind of seen to be one of those turning points in the Salem trials so this happens September nineteenth and then the next round of people being hang with September twenty second and after\nThat this is when you can really start to see public opinion change people are just horrified but what's happening the fact that they had pressed in eighty one year old man to death was even by those standards shocking it appalling and that had never happened in American history before it's very unusual kind of measure\nIn fact there was even a um years prior\nI'm a case where some of the judges who\nWere judges in the Salem witch trials were sitting on the other case again about a decade prior\nUm for a man who was convicted of piracy and he did the exact same thing Giles date he refused to answer you know how will you plead he stood mute and the court in that case just ignored him and tried him anyway\nAnd the judges as I said who were involved in the film which trials there were a couple of them who also involved in that case they would've known they would have seen that precedent but because the ... are so intense and because\nYou know you can kind of the public opinion starting to turn 'em you see this moment where it's most likely the judges\nWere kind of asserting their authority and saying you know we are the court you can't you know do this you can't you know criticize us to some degree so we're going to result to this\nYou know barbaric measure and so they do so um that's kind of one of the I think most memorable stories from the film which trials\nIn our presentation at our museum when we get to the um you know part of sixteen Ninety two when Giles is pressed\nHe um in our stage that says more weight he's asked\nPressed he um in our stage that says more weight he's asked\nYou know what do you say and he says more weight to which is you know this kind of really um you know kind of heroic thing it's kinda you know intense cool\nTo a certain degree um now if you look at actual history there's no record of South Korea really saying that that's something that's come down in popular folk tradition so he might have but I'm according to Marilyn Roach has one of the top scholars on the Salem witch trials\nIt's more likely that um that line actually comes from a poem that's written years later about a man being pressed to death and England so that's probably where that comes from the historical record which I think is kinda disappointing because\nMany of our visitors that's the thing that they take away when they leave our presentation the kind of more weight that line I don't know but\nUm it is based on you know folklore and all that jazz\nSo we do know he might have yeah I Believe he did [laughter] I think it's interesting\nToo because of the kinds of you mentioned no just kept thinking about it was you know if you plead guilty probably live as opposed to maintaining your innocence and ending up being you being hangs or or whatnot and I'm just thinking like yeah I'd probably be gone\n[laughter] believe me I think all the time\nI'm I'm a pretty outspoken young woman and a at that time if I was living in period America I probably would have been accused\nOf witchcraft or very quickly that thought crosses my mind all the time\nAnd one thing I think is interesting about museums to\nIs and I think it would help our listeners to ... you know we hear a lot about you know all the seventeenth century and we're talking about these trials could you talk about uh like the evidence at the museum actually uh the artifacts that you guys actually look up in the documents that the the kind of proved that what's going\nYou actually look up and the documents that the economy improves the what's going on in the seventeenth century\nYeah so I mean as I said there really aren't a lot artifacts so mainly what we're working with his court documents we also have diaries and letters and books that are published around that period\nSo for example um cotton Mather who's a very important minister in Boston during this time he writes essentially the court sanctions\nAnd government sanctioned um account of the Salem witch trials so obviously that's a very problematic account\nBecause it's coming it's the government sanctioned account so it's saying about what they did was right um you know it takes a selection of cases\nUm but that's one of the challenges of history is you have to read um understand the bias of your source and try to pull out the pieces that are true and the pieces that are exaggerated so you've gotten caught matters account and his father increase matter and I know those are both very silly names to us today\nBut these are seventeenth century names\nUm he also writes I'm a work that's kind of suppose to summarize\nUm the opinion of the ministers in Boston during this time and so he's talking more about spectral evidence and how they don't really think factual evidence should use but then cotton Mather writes his account that saying that the court was in the rights because\nWitchcraft is at work so um and then a couple of years later you have\nAnother man whose name is Robert ... who um is you know very critical of both matters he is definitely I'm not on their side he thinks that they're both abhorrent people and he writes his account that says a centrally that\nCotton Mather is um you know awful they caused innocent people to be executed and so on and so forth so you've got\nYou know awful they caused innocent people to be executed and so on and so forth so you've got these different\nUm contemporary accounts that are books and then you also have diaries that are being kept to judge ... who is the only judge\nTo formally apologize for his role in the film which trials he keeps a diary throughout this time so you can see 'em you know him recording him going to and from meetings his thoughts on certain things\nUm and then as I said we do have some of the court records unfortunately we don't have all of them but we have enough to see you know theoretically what's going on\nI'm obviously there are problematic um and that's again a big challenge for historians in general but when you're reading the court records this is someone else\nYou know obviously writing down what happened so this is someone saying\nYou know this is the testimony given in court so we do know is is that word for word with that person that is this a a summary is this paraphrasing you know we don't know but we do the best with what we can so it's it's enough to really piece together\nUm a lot of the story and you know obviously historian spend their entire lives poring over these documents and that's why we know as much as we do but again it's frustrating because when\nThe trail of documents stops that's when you have to just get so that's why we don't know what happens to the afflicted girls and I'm ... who is the first person to be accused of witchcraft or or one of the first three who is a sleeve we have no idea what happens to where after the trials we knew she sold to someone else\nAnd then she just disappears so we don't have a paper trail so we don't know what happens um it's it's one of those things that's them you know most frustrating part about being a historian\nWho I always like to ask anyone museum that question because\nI always like to ask anyone museum that question because\nI think the one who was interest me you know who the ... behind the scenes that goes into the learning everything about this and a one question and more because I remember the name of the book or in high school we read the crucible and how much of that is accurate or use an accurate portrayal of what was actually going on and say\nI mean there are definitely some very fictionalized aspects of the ... so\nArthur Miller who writes the crucible um did do his research at the ethics Institute in Salem in the Nineteen fifties when he's writing the play 'em so he really does capture a lot of the um kind of\nBig parts of the Salem witch trial so for example the you know main character of the crucible as John Proctor who you know maintains his innocence and is ultimately hanged and it's this big dramatic moment um and that is true\nUm and he kind of is capturing the essence of\nThe individuals who maintains the fact that they are innocent they are not guilty and they will not be branded as a which\nI'm so that you know uh from that perspective he's doing a great job and he's really paying attention to seventeenth century language and so on on the part of the crucible that it's quite frustrating though is he does kind of blame a lot of it on this\nSupposedly romance that's going on between John Proctor and Abigail Williams who's been afflicted girl now in reality John Proctor is in his sixties Abigail Williams is eleven so there's no documentation that that romance existed in any way\nI'm more likely I'm Mary Warren who was a servant and John proctors house\nThere is like one sentence in a court document that where John\nLike one sentence in a court document that where John Proctor refers to her as his jaded and the term jaded could be interpreted as almost ... or um you know kind of overly sexual woman and\nI'm you know he's saying it could be that he's saying that she is too loose and she is you know that's why she is a witch or something like that um but it could also be interpreted as he does have some sort of romantic passed with her we just don't know and again it's one sentence\n'em it's literally one word that kind of changes that relationship but Arthur Miller\nYou know he doesn't use Mary Warren he uses Abigail Williams is a completely different person um he makes up his entire elaborate relationship between them and that's why I'm Abigail William starts accusing people of witchcraft namely job doctors away so\nIncreasing clouds ticketing cloud showers late fall into\nDays mild tomorrow night increasing clouds ticketing cloud showers late fall into fifty again and then a windy

was looking up was the history of the jak whole answer and actually and it was interesting because after I was reading I I learned that the practice originated from an Irish myth about a man nicknames or stingy jak\nAccording to the story ... ah stingy jak invited the devil\nTo have a drink with him not what a night that must have been a [laughter] a true to his name stingy jak I didn't want to pay for his ring so he convinced the devil to turn himself into a coin\nOr that jak could use to buy their drinks and once the devil did so jak decided to keep the money and put it in his pocket next to the civil cross with a prevented the devil from changing back into its original form\nJak eventually freed the devil another condition that he would not bother jak for one year and that should jak die he would not claim has sold the next year or\nJak again trick the devil into climbing into a tree or to pick a piece of fruit while he was up there in the tree jak carve they sign\nYup he ... the ... the a sign of the cross into the tri borough of bark or so that the devils could not come down until the devil promise jak not to bottom again for ten years\nIt's really weird there's if you look at

these two positions are always began and it's where I looked this went up\nAnd the idea has roots in the middle ages when many people believe that which is avoid detection by turning themselves into black cats that's where it is the wishes of the people who do which in turn themselves in the blackout so that's why they're essentially associated with bad luck\nI'm ... and it also says in this article that we avoid going on the loudest from the same reasons superstition\nIn this article that we avoid going on the line with us from the same reason the superstition I may have come from the

and all around Halloween essentially we try to avoid breaking mirror stepping on cracks\nIn the road and or spilling salt in it it's interesting to all these superstitions I always wondered where uh
