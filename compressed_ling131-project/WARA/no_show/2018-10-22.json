April eleventh when most areas were nearer below thirty degrees upper twenties and many areas so a cold start to the day but I Will have a lot of sunshine all day today that's the good news as you\nMentioned dumb do cost the sun does as each day passes getting extremely ineffective and of course it gets worse as we go into a the month of December when we have the shorter stays in the

we do have meteorologist Jim ... standing by with another update for us on a forecast gym\nWell Dharma colder than it was the other morning how about that however we're going to have a lot of bright sunshine today\nStill costs waiting for the fun to come up again but until we set the clock back in less than two weeks we're going to have these uh late sun rises again seven oh five so still about over twenty five minutes to wait for the sun to come up\nRises again seven oh five so still about over twenty five minutes to wait for the sun to come up we're about twenty minutes or so a wins today out of the last five to Fifteen miles an hour again high temperatures today upper forties to maybe briefly about fifty that's still a several degrees below average tonight a clear this evening on mostly clear some high clouds and then\nA thickening clouds late tonight or nothing to worry about oh Lowes down into the mid thirties and then we'll have clouds and some sun tomorrow tomorrow the trade off it won't be quite as coolest today I in the mid fifties but there'll be a little more of the way a clause mixed with a little son one or two quick passing showers should be low impact\nAnd then as we go into tomorrow and I bought them out in the low forties setting the stage for sun and clouds on Wednesday\nA high back up to around fifty degrees and then Thursday colder again Thursday and friday probably the two coldest stretches of days we will have this week anyway low\nForties on Thursday after starting out in the mid thirties and then twenties again friday morning could be quite similar to this one when will be well down in the twenties and many areas and then a recovering back just to the low end mid forties friday afternoon and then again a monitoring all week this situation setting up for the weekend\nI could come as early as Saturday it could be delayed until late Sunday or Monday but right now indications are as I've been thinking for the last week that anything stormy would be before Halloween so Halloween of course a week from Wednesday yeah Halloween a week from this Wednesday\nOr looks to be dry and cool probably in the fifty fifty five category during the day thirties and low\nForties at night we cannot picture most of the time the Halloween as kids growing up going out and it never was really that warm and usually wasn't all that cold either and that's exactly the time of year we are in and then after that some indications late next week as I like to go long range of at least get started\nOf some warming temperatures as we start the month of November So that'll be a good thing anything positive you can talk about for the month of November ...\nA month of November So that'll be a good thing\nAnything positive you can talk about for the month of November weather wise is a good thing\nFive fifty three the sunset today again a reminder was setting the clocks back now a week from this upcoming weekend so that means the weekend right before\nThe election I tied at seven o'clock level low tide at one o'clock and by the way the water temperatures at the beach is can you believe I still I just looked at horse neck beach temperature or snack beach here we are on the twenty second of October the water is still sixty three degrees now that has come down a few degrees from the last few weeks but still\nIf someone was not that worried too much about cold water\nOr you could easily do some swimming at some of our south coast beaches right now and in fact a there will probably be some people there much of this week because we're going to have at least doses of sunshine and if you would've jumped in sixty three that we are degree water today you would warm up above them\nYeah I can just imagine some of the people out there and they're wet suits or even not even in a wet suit speed going in there at this time of the year hey if they can get a couple of days in why not right on\nThat's it why not and again a late this week with this weekend I Will have to monitor rough seas possibly develop me or where you might not want to be in the water unless you were a great surfer will have to monitor this this will this storm that's in the Pacific yeah they're already done it a W storm in the Pacific this was the a specific\nIt's going to be I think the devastation of initially strong winds up the coast but if you know the topography of most of Mexico outside of the Yucatan it is very mountainous once you get in usually within about fifty to a hundred miles from the coast so what is going to do is going to drop devastating floods and again the only reason I'm really bringing this up making a deal of it\nIs the fact that some of the entity that may be injected into what we could get this weekend\nSo it's going to jump the mountains now this was a ... ...\nWeekend so it's going to jump the mountains now this is a positive on\nA which is a little further\nUp the coast in there in South of there is a you know ... which is a classic theory a lot of time a lot of times the love boat with sometimes go there are on the love boat show but at any rate that area is going to get devastated by initially got flooding at the coast big waves\nOr maybe somewhat similar to what Michael did in Florida a couple of weeks ago\nThen it's going to bring out heavy rains the mountains in central Mexico some of them get his highest Thirteen thousand feet\nSo what that does is a lift the air and it's going to have devastating floods mudslides I it's just not a good situation now once it jumps the mountains it comes back down as it approaches\nSouthern Texas a as a quote approaches the Rio Grande area were flattened out again and then that entity leftover because it's so initially strong could produce some heavy rains in Texas\nLouisiana all the south the Gulf Coast areas and then reform off the Carolinas or later this week and possibly into a very large ocean storm\nAnd depending on his track or could affect our weather here a big waves possibly at the coast and also some strong winds inland could take trees that will have to monitor it and I don't mean to sound dramatic but as you know like to be blunt and let everyone know that as nice as it's going to be much of this week uh the weekend\nI could be a different story so again darn good news so today we got the sunshine and yet again another one of these\nDays with the sun has essentially out all day long but we still have to wait a minute Fifteen more minutes before it comes up\nYeah I guess we can go and actually we have to ask for sure\nWe have to we can't control a mother nature or also a mother a astronomical stuff so I'll have another update coming up\nIn the ... that's for sure All right Jim thanks so much hey I talked

missile of concern which is known as the nine ...\nIn greater numbers this missile of concern which is known as the nine am seven to nine if Russia wants to if this treaty has gone all the constraints on the testing the production of employment of these missiles in Europe and elsewhere will be gone and then\nTrump says ah you know if if Russia and China don't abide by the treaty or we're gonna have to build missiles of this type that kind of logic\nSimply doesn't make any any uh any sense given a few basic facts one is China wasn't party to the INS treaty\nOr the U.S and in Russia have been ah the United states doesn't need a ground launched intermediate range missiles to deal with China in fact the vice chairman of joint chiefs of staff\nLast year said explicitly we do not need such missiles to counter China and\nThe United states doesn't have any such missile in development and there's no NATO country that would accept any such ground launched cruise missile\nOr to be deployed and their their territory the last time that happened back in Nineteen eighty three there were millions of Europeans in the streets telling Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to get rid of those those missiles so\nFor a number of reasons this is counterproductive it's dangerous and it does a opened the door\nTo the possibility of renewed nuclear competition in this area and it could threaten another important treaty the new strategic arms treaty the main treaty limiting the two sides strategic arsenals which is due to expire and twenty Twenty one if Trump imprudent don't extend it\nOne last call in Nineteen eighty seven found that when President Reagan and president Mikhail Gorbachev signed the intermediate range nuclear weapons treaty ins Reagan talked about ... the\nOf this\nAnd some of the dia the numbers of dentistry the vet vicious [noise] I'm a Soviet side over Fifteen hundred deployed war is will be removed and all round\nIntermediate range missiles including the is just one of these will be destroyed our entire comment of her she too and\nRules missiles which were his will\nDestroy the dishes missiles on both sides will also be short\nSo that's a President Reagan speaking in Nineteen eighty seven about the importance of this agreement now you spoke about the fact that I Am Russia was violating this treaty but Russia is also accused the U.S of violating the treaty or is there any truth to that\nOr Russia has said they have deep concerns about whether the United states convert\nA defense of missile interceptors that are part of the U.S missile defense architecture that are now in Romania and will be in Poland for offensive purposes so they have a a sad that that has a problem they have\nA it's a look if we look at the situation the United states as a serious concerns about Russia's compliance\nOr the Russians have concerns about us future compliance a what a really ought to happen as there should be a\nAn arrangement by which there are trends parents they visits by technical experts to examine these missiles of concern and the two sides could conceivably work out an arrangement by which are each side's concerns are are addressed and if Russia does have missiles\nThat can fly in excess of the the treaty limits or they could be a called upon to stop deployment but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions uh\nPoint it but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions are at the detailed expert level about how to resolve this in fact the only been to meetings on the IMF issue between us and Russian officials since Trump came into office\nI mean can you talk about how many how many ... does the United states has how many does Russia have um is this just give to the weapons\nManufacturers just no holds barred take restraints off\nWell ... you're right I mean we got to where to put all this in perspective you know even though the Cold War is over so to speak or the weapons that were created during the Cold War still exist and the the nuclear strategies and the United states and Russia had at that time are still very much in place so\nAs we sit here this morning chatting about this uh the United states deploys about one thousand four hundred warheads on long range bombers and missiles that on land and on the uh the Russians have equivalent numbers\nAbout eight hundred of those could be launched on an order from the president within about twenty minutes\nSo that means that both sides remain on hair trigger or if there is a warning of an attack\nOr the nuclear strategies call for um the immediate launch of\nEight hundred or more a nuclear warheads or in retaliation so that creates the chance for miscalculation so we have massive overkill\nOr we have a situation in which the fate of literally a hundreds of millions of people rest in in the hands of a of a small number of people specifically to a gentleman Trump and food and uh so uh we're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the ...\nWe're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the treaties that was negotiated in the eighties by none other than Ronald Reagan or that help end the Cold War so this does reopen the possibility of\nA a new arms race which of course would certainly benefit or the weapons contractors ah that would build or any any new weapons\nCould you give us a sense and the floor we conclude what state but the new start treaty and given indication that Trump will pull out of the ... has been opposed to that as well\nWell uh yeah Bolton before he came into office he was he wanted to pull out of the IMF treaty he has said a negative things about the new strategic arms reduction treaty\nOr so that treaty was negotiated by bronco bomb and two dollars and ten it's scheduled to expire in February five twenty Twenty one just a few days after the next in our inauguration day\nA Trump including could however agreed to extend it by five years\nAlong with the trends parents seem verification provisions that are very important um and right now John Bolton is leading an interagency review about whether to extend the treaty trash the treaty or try to renegotiate some new treaty and the the little amount of time left between now and twenty Twenty one\nSo you know if we if we look at this I enough decision I'm very worried that John Bolton is headed in the same direction with respect to the new start treaty and if that's the case we would not have legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two [noise]\nSo it's very important for Congress or to step up a Republicans and Democrats who support the new start treaty to press a Trump to extend this treaty to buy some more time so that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiation\nSo that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiations with Russia or to further reduce the the bloated and costly arsenals of these these two\nAnd finally we just have thirty seconds but even though this is an agreement between the U.S or it was and is it actually Trump saying we're pulling out meaning we have pulled out it's also a message to China that President Trump is sending\nWell he may think so um I don't think the Chinese are particularly perturbed a you know China has most of its arsenal on ground launched missiles or with a a medium or intermediate range just has to do with geography\nUm they're under no pressure to join the IMF treaty um and uh they have a relatively small about three hundred nuclear weapons arsenals that they feel is sufficient to deter the United states so he may think he's sending a message to sign up but I don't think it's a very effective one\nMhm and what does it mean is the U.S out since Trump said they are\nWell that's a great question I mean these discussions between John Bolton and the Russians today in Moscow I think will be key\nUh it is not clear whether a Trump is actually pulling out um it may be that they're trying to threaten that the U.S will pull out of Russia doesn't do something in particular\nThat's not clear ah my Russian contacts have not yet heard anything like that our European allies have not heard anything like that but I think it's quite likely if we remain on the current track that the IMF treaty will be terminated by Donald Trump sometime in twenty Nineteen\nKimball want to thank you for being with us director the arms control association previously led the coalition to reduce nuclear dangers [laughter] this is democracy now democracy now for the war and peace in front of course we'll continue to report on the U.S Russia ins treaty when we come back change and\nRussia ins treaty when we come back change and trends policy and the part of the Trump Administration stay with us\n\n\n\nThink the concern is that we're hearing a debate about trans existence that is not being led by trans people and so much of what we're seeing is understanding of trans nest that\nReally in trenches this notion that there's some biological truth affects and something else that's ideological called gender and that really is a false dichotomy and what we're seeing is that by by\nSaying that there's something called science that's true ah interesting that the administration\nThat there's something called science that's true\nAh interesting that the administration is using science to defend all rather than they are and how science um but but the reality is that\nThat that I think what I Want people to really understand is there any things that are typically true in science so for example it maybe typically true that men have certain bodies but it's a political choice to make that definitional to say men have to have certain bodies in order to be men and I think what we have to understand is that\nThese are political choices that are part of a long legacy that is very much connected colonialism white supremacy and efforts to exclude people from participation and said we're I think is the best place to get information on transition\nI think the best place to get information on trans issue is from trans people so we can look at publications that have trans writers whether that broadly advice then a Hyundai not publication teen vogue\nThe voices of trans people have a long challenged the way this conversation has been framed in places like the New York times and you're at times the New Yorker the guardian are regularly running pieces ... attacking whether or not trans people can and should exist\nAs we begin to wrap up you are I'm Chelsea Manning's lawyer Chelsea just tweeted this

know I just want to say I am so proud of tells the I'm so happy to see her getting the health care that she needs I Hope other trans people also also get that health care and I just want to say to the trans community this is a terrifying time people were breaking out into tears yesterday I Know people are just\nDid he this is a terrifying time people were breaking out into tears yesterday I Know people are scared but we have a long history of resistance and we will continue to fight and we absolutely will survive well I Want to thank you very much chased strange you for joining us staff

I still very much feel like a political newcomer so I appreciate this opportunity to come on here and I introduced myself a little bit\nJust well I one of the things we did I once knew for a long time to talk about leadership leadership in general not you know specifics 'cause this there is something that we can learn there that will make us better leader is whether it's in our families or\nIn our community or you know\nAt our church or whatever um that are followers to 'em so you know there's some skills to some knowledge that goes with it and I thought you were just three deployments to Iraq and\nOnly to one of the Iraq went to Afghanistan\nOne term Iraq and went to Afghanistan and how old are your kids then\nUm they weren't around when I was in Iraq in um\nBut then my oldest was four when I was over in Afghanistan and uh it it's interesting so I I left him at home with mom for ... for about a year and when she potty trained them and\n[laughter] it maybe a little piece of as a child who had bought you felt that you had to do to go and serve the country\nIt was really a choice necessarily um I I definitely felt obligated to re enlist time and again it and\nLook at my military service in my decision to join the Army National guard is one of the best decisions I've made my life from ... it's it's taught me a lot and it's the the Army National guard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer sort of thing\nGuard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer it's sort of thing\nIn Philly we're way for Eighteen months to go to Iraq or a year to go to Afghanistan and all of that but normally it's it's a part time thing um and it's really fascinating to sort of be working at a civilian job as a as a as a software guy and then down to the way to go\nBut it's important um\nAre the army values are loyalty duty respect selfless service on Iraq I think as I said don't go on to them because they are important loyalty\nLoyalty loyalty to your fellow city council is not to go behind their back or something like that\nWill in the the one I was ... loyalty duty in respect in that respect one of the last ... I was getting to respect somebody that you disagree with but it's important that you do yes which ... find you\nKnow you find maybe find something good in that person and something noble and that person that you admire mhm\nIn and they were ... ... there were people on the council that I thought there was no way I Would get along with that disagree pretty strongly with with the marijuana stuff that I ...\nIt was pretty strongly with with some of the marijuana stuff that I I have a lot of respect for or even though we very much disagree on some of the issues are\nInto that respect is is I think ... incredibly important so when this marijuana issue was being heard in discussed before the full counsel for the final vote um\nI was getting messages up into the day before and the day I was saying if if this passes and this way that you know will veto it with if we if you restrict it to five I'm\nI'm like I I I went to the past and and I think it's in the way that I prefer to see it but I knew some of the other counsellors were concerned about the the zoning aspects of it so I\nStayed up late Wednesday night put together an amendment that there was a fairly long set of amendments to change it from\nBeing zones in the retail aspects of adult use marijuana known to general business to restrict everything to industrial zones and I very much disagreed with that amendment\nBut I felt my fellow counselors would have made that amendment and actually on the day of three of them had said that they were you know feverishly scribbling notes that tried to make that amendment so\nI don't think alike you know how badly solve this kind of impasse that would seem to be developing\nAnd I disagreed with the amendment but I felt it was only fair in respectful to my fellow counselors to give them an opportunity to have the discussion on the couch a floor to give their ideas of chats I'm In it and I feel that what democracy sort of all about um\nI disagree with it I made the\nUm I disagree with it I made the amendment I argued my point the gets it and ultimately I lost it everything has been restricted to industrial zones\nNow for now are for this which is a brand new in the city and in the state and so\nWhy not give it a try like an experiment and then later on it can be change when people are more familiarity with it I mean I I'm a raging liberal so [laughter] but I mean I can see anything in the benefits as a compromise\nIt I did too and I was very proud of it because after that change it it I ... I didn't get what I wanted\nBut ultimately the overall ordinance change passed unanimously and I was very happy that we sort of supporting came together for that matter um in that\nAnd you are doing a little bit or indirect effect on other is that you weren't going to\nPush and being noxious that you were going to continue to respect them even though you\nDisagreed and I could have tried to play games and ...\nIf an amendment was made and it was a perfect I could've been tacked that aspect of it as opposed to discussing the ideas are based on the merits of the idea of some of them so I thought that was important it was one of\nIt is the the one moment that I'm most proud of him so far not not necessarily passing the the ordinance itself but the way the law and other than work together\nSo what are the qualities that a person needs when they have to change their their mind or cooperate or collaborate in order to get a good decision I I I have no idea [laughter] what are the I mean I I come from a sterile background and so I'm thinking you have cats\nI come from a minister or background or so\nI'm thinking you have to have a certain humility I agree\nI very much agree I I think you know we can come in and say I know all the answers and I'm right and you're walking and you know that leads to what we have in Washington [laughter] now and and um you know the authoritarian mentality down there\nThat everybody that disagrees should just roll over and play dead is is poison\nI mean I think that's why city councils are great because we have to live with each other\nYou know you we don't do their own countries are going to see\nEach other and and buy you a compromising or being flexible the next time there's something they want you know there may be more given tape\nWhere at least the merits of the ideas right will will with two guys are a nation\nGiven to different viewpoints than they were all\nAnd I don't mean this in terms of personality is on the city council I mean general and how we get along\nIn a in that comes with the middle humility like you said you know it's it's incredibly important yeah um I could use more of it but [laughter]\nIf you ask my wife [laughter]\nUm but ... it's\nNot sure she has ways of telling you that [laughter] certainly [laughter] I mean in our spouses that me and my spouse my husband\nIs is is it might get ... just about everything I Do you mean 'cause I Know he he sold fair and he's so\n... and he knows how to put these things in the gentlest way\nAnd I don't get my feelings hurt and they don't come I backed out um but I Do come to that place of humility because\nUm but I Do come to that place of humility because of the respect that we share for one another\nIt's common set of values [laughter] it is you\nTalked about the the army values of loyalty duty respect\nAnd loyalty duty respect\nThe fourth one is self uh self with surface which is selfless\nService so which isn't giving over of yourself to a greater benefits and then we'll come to us he will benefit others and we may not get any benefit from\nIt looking at the overall benefit as opposed to any personal gain is um\nWhat's the best thing for our as a community that you know the question that a lot of leaders would ask themselves\nAnd there was at one point or a friend of mine has suggested oh why don't you go to this event or or do this and it'll be great come reelection time to to show your ...\nAnd I I ... I was like\nDon't ever make that argument with the like what's what's\nThe it has to have any meaning for you\nAnd you went to a um a veterans a event was it\nA few of them yes ... and that means a lot to me personally\n... you said you said one of them you will you you'll take your son to next time I was so beautifully done and it was such a beautiful program\nThat was the POW nine eleven event that was incredibly touching\nMhm um yeah and and I feel bad that I didn't bring them this time\nIt was a lot of time [laughter]\nBut I I mean I think\nYou know one of the things I like about doing the show is I get introduced to people I wouldn't otherwise get to know and I get to read present them to the public\nGet to know and I get to read things and than to the public and um and and the benefits of working in the city council is you can find some amazing people\nIt's it's really a\nIn an interesting group of people and it's been fascinating to get to know each of them individually as well as the multitude of people within the community that I wouldn't have met normally I mean I wouldn't have knocked on your door if it was it was a ... it's it's great and it's\nIt's personally very touching to me to to be that that much more involved in that community just set the example for my kids I mean uh it's super excited my my son Jake ended up running for ...\n... ...

illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask I'm Kerry Baluch community relations coordinator at the hospital and out of our Massachusetts and with me is\nDirt ... and and I am a sufferer of mental illness and I'm trying to be here to try to break some stigmas that go along with it so Terry um what are we trying to we're trying to do with this podcast here\nDerek I really feel that this podcast is meant to make individuals aware of mental health and mental illness in our communities to break stigma to educate 'em as somebody who has a background\nThe very diverse background and mental health um I can say that education outreach and community outreach are so important to the care and the continuity of care for individuals who are suffering from mental illness so I think we just really wanted to get the word out there\nSo I'm for people who don't know us while we do a little bit of a background ourselves not you know nothing to link thing so um what brought you into this field carry\nSo I actually started off on with a desire to be an art therapist\nBecause I had a passion for our and I had a passion for psychology um when I went to college items to my major to art in psychology and just figured you know what I'll see her life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my\nI'll see where life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my first job working for a a clubhouse model and hope deal math\nAnd I worked with the chronically mentally ill population but even beyond that there is there's a deeper passion that I have for the population besides the experiences that I've had\nWorking with these individuals my father my father is he diagnosed or individual with bipolar disorder and I have seen him struggle throughout my entire life\nAnd I've always had this soft spot in my heart\nFor it in perspective of mental illness is not just your label mental illness is just an aspect of you so from the outside world someone may see for instance my father and say that so and so that's where he has bipolar disorder\nBut I always knew him as dad that's my dad and he just happens that bipolar disorder\nThat I strongly feel influenced my passion for understanding I got the human mind focusing on psychology and then leading into I'm leading to working with individuals with chronic mental health disorders\nAs I said in this field in Massachusetts for about five years\nAnd then decided to make a life leap I moved down to Pennsylvania and I had the opportunity to work with a very different population and I've worked with individuals with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors as well as chronic mental health disorders it gave me a very different aspect\nAnd we'll have local a gas that will be able to um offer more insight into into these topics\nSo where to take a short break and who do we have coming and we have a great first guest that you um lined up for us who's coming in\nAbsolutely so we have Rachel legend on Rachel is the CEO of our hospital here in Atlanta borrow and she'll be joining us she has a an extensive background and mental health and she'll be able to offer kind of perspective of um services and mental health needs in issues in our local community\nOkay great I'm so stay tuned a this is exploring mental illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to rest and we'll be right back\nOK well come back we're going to have carry introduce our first guest who she knows a very well here it for hospital\nThank you Derek I'd like to welcome Rachel legend CEO at full or hospital a two hour first pot cast\nAnd a ritual to start off about a little bit about your background and the mental health field\nUm thanks for having me appreciate being here I'm a licensed social worker by trade 'em I've spent the last Thirty years my career I'm serving behavior of clients and both macro legislative work as well as micro doing clinical work\nYou ever have clients in both macro legislative work as well as Mike Rowe doing clinical work with very high risk population so algae Beatty kids um and then sexual assault survivors and then lastly behavioral health patients in a psychiatric Hedy\nSo I started in the psyche D's 'em and fell in love with a behavioral health patients I'm primarily psychotic patients or who I really enjoy working with\nHere at full or I think one of the most rewarding things about everything I've done is looking at how do we take a patient when they first arrive and then what are they looked like when they leave 'em and we create an environment where they can heal and access resources I mean that that is the bottom line of what we do here every day\nAnd I'm One of the biggest misconceptions about mental health care facilities\nUm I think there's so many but I guess the first I'd say is kind of outdated view that were an institution and it's an institutionalized feel\nI think the great thing about four hospitals is actually used to be a family mansion back in the day and I was a community family here and so the old horse stables are actually a patient unit every single patients' rooms have windows\nBut I think the truth is is that we are here to deliver a compassionate care\nBy license clinicians and psychiatrists we're here to do good work and so we spend our days\nGoing to groups and I'm Talking to physicians and doing therapeutic interventions mean that that's I think not a perception of people are sitting around medicated and not receiving services and not getting engaged and that couldn't be further from the truth\nNow is one person or on my own I've been trying to break the stigma of mental illness by becoming very open a talking about a very openly not being embarrassed about it I Know why breaking the stigma of mental illnesses saw him on why do you think it's so important and why is it so hard to do\nRight you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um\nHard to do right you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um and it's rampant in our community because of the taboo of what people believe I think it goes back to the institutional comments I just made\n'em but the truth is the vast majority of us us ourselves have a family member or friend who suffers from mental illness or substance abuse and so the truth is when we realized that it touches many many people in our lives and across all demographics\nUm socioeconomic genders race\nWhen we start to look at it and the impact that it has then I think people like you are opening people's eyes that that it does it impacts all of us I mean\nI have people who work for me or some of the most amazing employees I have who have mental illness and carry a diagnosis and they're productive and engaged and compassionate and I would say they even bring an added level of care\nUm to our patients because they understand um what it's like to live in those shoes I think the disease impacts a massive amount of the people in our community\nIn this facility works to treat those people in a compassionate patient centered way um and we also serve as a beacon in our community for those who are in need or who seek help to say we're here walk in our front door you know let us assess let us off or resources\nAre carrying I think he had a couple of questions I did [noise]\nRachel how do you think gender plays a role in mental illness I think that's an interesting concept because um and when we look at gender and societies impact on gender um we have all kinds of conceptions about how men and or women should behave and so\nThose social contracts of gender we we actually makeup and so what we believe about gender today is not how people perceive gender\nFifty one hundred a hundred and fifty years ago or in different countries for that matter the truth is that impacts both men and women um but in some ways the way it impacts can be different we have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations um\nWe have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations I'm an act like we know how many should be um and when they act less than that we call them weak or other more inappropriate names\nSo it makes it harder for men to seek treatment and so we see 'em for depression and anxiety less men receiving treatment for depression anxiety you see more women receiving treatment and so it's our job at this facility with the help of people like Derek to say\nThis is an impact across the board because people experienced trauma\nUm similarly and so how do we set the stage for a man to be able to walk in and say I need assistance with some of the stuff but also to honor that the vast majority of women have trauma histories and so how do we also create a facility\nAnd a team enter treatment team in physicians who are able to accept\nUm sexual assault survivors into this facility and treat them in a way that allows them to heal I think it's also important we were talking about gender to acknowledge that transgender gender community and so the facility has worked really hard\nTo make sure not only we abide by state statute and abide by hate crimes but that we worked diligently to create a facility that accepts all people period until whatever that looks like man woman transgender patient who comes in here and can be expected to be treated along with best practice to not be re traumatized\nBy coming into a facility that doesn't know how to engage all patients with equality and respect and dignity\nCan you give us an example or even a story of of of something that you've seen where you have been able to address this gender roles this gender issue within a mental health facility or setting\nThem I think I'd go back to um the trans community and I think it has been practice that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single ...\nPractice that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single room so we'll have separate and apart bathrooms I think certainly history has told us um that separate is not equal\nAnd so we've worked diligently here to honor someone's known gender and so we have a trans man who comes in um we're putting him with a male roommate access to the male haul 'em as well as access to mail bathrooms and so\nWe frequently will get pushback around that and say what about the other clients\nBut the truth is we navigate this every single day in a vast majority of different circumstances so people who are struggling with race issues and men and may make racial comments we appropriately placed patients in rooms where they're going to have the most success and sometimes with some of those around\nAnd that's the way it goes but setting the stage for every single person who comes in here to be treated with dignity\nTo honor their identity um honor the work that they need to do and create a healing space for them in fact to do that and we can't do that um if we set the stage from hello that we're not doing the right thing and not honoring who that human is and so I think at full or we're done an exceptional job all the way from intake\nTo honoring people's preferred names um and how does that look and how do we set the stage on the unit for that to be carry through from beginning to end from admission from the very first time you walk into this facility to the day you leave in every single staff is on the same page\nAbout what my expectations are of my staff about how we treat patients but also setting the stage across the board for other patients who are on the unit who may struggle who may not have information who may not have knowledge about that I'm In a way that's appropriate in confidential but again honors that individual patient\nI have I have a follow up to that um how tough has a learning curve been with the the transgender problems that the you know that you face here at the hospital right now\nTransgender problems that them you know that you face here at the hospital right now I'm you know I mean I honestly I think\nThe learning curve is ongoing and I think it will be because you know I've done L G T trainings for hospital systems for schools for H R departments for Twenty years\nAnd honestly the training is I did Twenty years ago were super different than the training I Do today because language changes um expectations change statute and legislation changes\nUm and the truth is more often than not it's the adolescent population of the gay lesbian by trans kids who kind of drive and push forward some progress so the language isn't the same as Twenty years ago and so\nThe learning curve is ever present quite honestly\nHowever I Will say that the best practices we put in place here kind of set the stage for expectations so we have a policy on how we engage and treat ... patients\nThat addresses language pronoun use name use 'em while we can't change a healthcare card or a medical record that doesn't mean that we can't honor someone's\nName restroom room designation in a way that meets what their gender is so it's ever changing and were up for the task and I think we do it better than most quite honestly\nAbsolutely I totally agree\nNaming in claiming mental illness I'm definitely reduces the stigma especially when it's the people we care about coming out if you will write write coming out we usually use as an algae term but I like to explain coming out to people as\nTelling someone something that you're not sure how they'll react because the truth as every single person knows how that feels right doesn't matter is it about mental illnesses that about being a domestic violence survivor is it about being a child of an alcoholic it is it about being a lesbian like whatever it's about we all know what that feels like\nAnd so the truth is that that is what it feels like and so how do we honor that and support people and they're already in crisis right now no one is coming to flourish front door um because they're having a good day\nAnd so we need to be prepared literally from my front desk staff through the nurse who says hello while they walk on the unit to the first mental health worker they engage with all of those people to be hand holding and compassionate and engaged in full of information in creating a place that feels safe\nBecause that's that's the first step if you don't feel safe you're not going to you have no ability to work on anything and you're not healing um first and foremost do you feel safe can we reduce anxiety to a place that you can start thinking about what are what are the things that I actively need to work on to feel better\nYou said talking about coming out because I was I'd um I had told Kerry it'll be five years in February that I came out on Facebook mhm about my struggles with it\nBe five years in February that I came out on Facebook about my struggles with mental illness for the past Twenty years at that time\nAnd I got you know like two or three hundred likes I had all these private messages and I said I appreciate\nYou know what you folks but I didn't do it for like ... I didn't do it for I just want to let people know my car can only break down so times I kept lying you know I lost jobs lost friends I lost it was like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders\nBut then I got a lot of private messages about fifty to sixty private messages you know what I suffer from the same thing so unfortunately but fortunately I was kind of an expert at the time on what they were going through\nSo now they would call me at midnight or one or two or three in the morning say him having anxiety attack okay calmed down it's going to be okay I'm In coming out on Facebook you know that was\nThat was my big thing like I said it was a huge weight lifted off my shoulder and there was no\n... everybody was proud of you you know and I knew some people knew but I don't think they knew to what degree in how bad it was and doing that you know people you know the chicken I hey how ya doing haven't seen it on Facebook in awhile haven't heard from your while I'm having a tough time so like I said you know I just wanted my life back\nThat was the biggest thing so I don't I don't understand why you know I I you know from when you said before you get called names and stuff like that but if you've got friends and you've got a great support system they're not going to hold it against you got and granted I lost some friends\nBut most of my friends when I came out and I told them what I was suffering from they did research on it so they could try to help me right handed or engage conversation right they would go on the Internet and they just wouldn't say oh it's an excuse is it's an excuse he's using his\nHis anxiety depression and his panic as an excuse well no I'm not and if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use as an excuse\nAnd if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use it as an excuse I use breaking down my cars an excuse to cover up my mental illness don't cover it up anymore I wear a badge I own it but it doesn't define who you know who I Am anymore\nYou know that was part of the reason so I I live in this community right I used to live six minutes down the road and I would drive by this hospital consistently and actually only knew of this hospital because I also ran a behavioral health\nFacilities in Rhode Island and so when I first got hired here I thought you know that that's my local grocery store next door um this is the main thoroughfare more people need to understand what the White House on the hill is because\nWhen we start to understand that fuller is integrated in this community people who live and work here I'm living this community\nAnd so when Kerry came on the first thing I ever said to her as I went to community fair on our front lawn\nAnd lo and behold less than half a year later you know she produce four hundred people in\nFifty um community resource vendors\nAnd so and that's where I'm at you and so that that's important right that's how we do this is come on my front lawn meet my staff\nSay hello carnival games for the kids let me show you who we are and what we're about and what we do here so that we can again we're always working to kind of reduced the stigma that you continue to talk about\nBecause the truth is people work at fuller because we are looking to help people make their lives better and people are here because they're struggling there's not anyone in this facility who isn't currently sick and so\nHow do we get them better and part of it is isn't a community fair is things like the semi colon project so that we started to have some visibility around mental health and so we'll have another community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to\nOther community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to come on our front lawn to hang out with us um because the truth is that's the only way to start to break it down\nYou know I had to put us I put a banner out front that says walking welcome because I Want people to know that you can walk into our front door you don't have to make a call you don't have to get a PCP referral you don't have to go to an emergency department\nAnd that doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either it means I'm struggling can you help and our answer is always going to be yes what is it you need and how do we make it happen and you know my my staff kind of makes fun of me consistently but what am I saying as we come from a place of yes here\nAnd so can we make it happen the answer is yes can I help that patient the answer is yes can I get you to where you need to go next yes can I make you feel better yes\nAnd what we can't do it alone we can't do without the patients engagement we can't do it all out with a whole team um but the answer is yes we come from a place of yes how can I help yes come in my front door yes come and ask for help yes we will be there to answer\nWhat would you like people to know about fuller aside and you know you don't want people just think oh that's the house up on the hill with a crazy people go rent so your your final thoughts what do you want people to get out of today's a message\nI liked him to see solar as a resource there are engaged staff there are you know my CFO started hairs housekeeper and never left and he still has his housekeeping shirt on the back of his door\nYou know my director of facilities full or on the entire neighborhood out behind here and ah his mom was a nurse here and he grew up with full or rent and his mom one of those houses and he's never left here um that is what fuller is\nFull or as a place that has engage staff who are here saying we want to help we're here to help\nBut this community should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to a needy do not have to go\nYou should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to any do you do not have to go to a clinic you do not have to go to your PCP and it doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either we have a partial hospitalization program where you can go for the day I have an intensive outpatient program where you can go three times a day or do half days\nThere are many many options to get you help 'em that don't necessarily end up an inpatient level of care however we have that if that's where you are as well\nAnd so if people could start to see fuller one is a place that's accessible because that's very important to me um but to as a resource um and even if it's just to go straight to outpatient\nHow do we help you set up that therapist appointment that has just been too hard for you to do on the outside because patients if they could have done it they would have already done it right no one's more committed to a patient's care than the patient themselves and so frequently I find if they could have made something happened they already have\nAnd so how does fuller offer that next step to actually get them that peace will ever whatever it is we should be accessible um and we should come from places yes Rachel\nI just honestly want to say thank you for your ah participation today hearing you helps that confirmed the reason why I Know personally I'm here and I work um for this hospital\nYou are a fantastic
