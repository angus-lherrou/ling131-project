is an Arab or All right\nAnd uh I practice business employment\nArab or are right and uh I practice business employment law but I enjoy your community activism basically and so I enjoy getting involved in the city government and this one particular issue discuss today it's one of my project\nYes let's tell people how you got involved in this uh the bylaws write you wrote some of the bylaws all of the bylaws\nYes uh I got involved in this because a compressor station which is a a um a station used by the natural gas industry to increase the pressure on their gas lines\nOr to push the gas I'm faster and and with more gas through their pipelines to various points in the state and um\nThey had proposed a compressor station\nWhich is a big station is about uh oh about twenty five acres and they have a site about a hundred and fifty acres in the woods in real hope with across from oak hill avenue I live right across from ... new so\nMuch toxic material that comes out of these pipelines um that that can be harmful to the atmosphere can be harmful to people\nUm have they ever sat down with these officials are to talk about the environmental and how people in your group feel about this there is there any kind of\nFeedback from them on this or is all corporate greed and we've got to push as many as much gas as we can through well\nWe do have meetings every once in a while and I've attended them where we've explained the environmental and safety hazard to people's health\nUh about some of the emissions that are caused by both leaks and the gas lines as well as the compressor station\nCompressor station which are very much apple find those types of emissions because\nEvery once in a while I'm On a regular basis they have what's called a blow down and the gas pressure increases so much at that station that they have to have a sudden release of missions into the air\nAs noisy as well as it it all of a sudden releases a concentrated amount of methane and other toxic chemicals into the air\nI bet the meetings where this has been explained to officials by a there's a doctor nor guard who is an excellent um researcher or studying all the chemicals that are involved and you should see the list of chemicals in her\nEmitted um methane is one that things one very dangerous chemical and a quite a few others we have actually an engineer and our group enroll hold with that\nUm has compiled a list of all these chemicals in and troubles with is to ah every once in a while um plan out um meetings with with these officials telling them\nAnd while I'm plan out um meetings with with these officials telling them what the toxicity can can do as far as effects on health\nWhere can people find out more about uh the compressor and this issue I mean you gave me a great article from the Boston Globe a couple of weeks ago where can people read more about this\nWell we do have a ... against their whole with compressor Facebook page and that is a public group has about three thousand numbers\nAnd every day we have new articles new a new comments by people in the movement and anybody's welcome to\nTo join in and also see the latest every day we have news articles or the globe has been a and and the sun chronicle have been a contributing quite a few articles lately and\nAnd uh there's a representative a of of our district a Jim Hoskins who is is a contributor to that Facebook page and he contributes quite a bit too\nI was going to mention him next he will be with us on Thursday morning here and I'm certainly sure we'll talk about that topic and many more\nOther local political leaders mayor Paul hero I'm sure is against this I'm Julie hall his Republican candidate um certain sure she is against it we talked a little bit of a governor Baker who ultimately would have something on his desk should this past one of the chances that that could happen well\nShe had just aren't very great in the legislature now that there was a chance at some point\nUh last year of them pushing through what would it be called a ... a while it was an environmental bill actually us designed to help the environment as far as the emissions are concerned\nDesigned to help the environment as far as the admissions are concerned hidden within that bill was something that Governor beggars office included which would allow\nNatural gas to be part of the future energy mix um plans for the state uh and got her bakers Ben ... about a natural gas and he's actually supported that as part of the future\nUh for energy and if I'm meeting energy needs in Massachusetts and that did not get past that was taken out after an uproar or by state legislators and the public we had a protest actually about that\nAnd so the environmental bill did not include that provision which ... might have allowed natural gas to be included in\nWhat's called a safe energy mix of a future energy sources um so it's it's just an environmentally friendly can you consider natural gases environmentally friendly energy source\nSo that was not included in the legislatures is pretty good at this point\nWe've had a couple of different possible setbacks last year um it was very interesting we had um it represents Steve how down here from their whole with area [noise] um and he um actually we sort of caught him in the\nUm in his cooperation with some energy lobbyist\nAnd they had um very interesting story on one of the people in the group was on on an email chain with a with Steve Howard and\nAnd all of a sudden in the middle of the chain or a mistake in a little pop up came up with a name which she didn't recognize how to be in it\nBut came up with a name which she didn't recognize how to be an energy lobbyist while coaching him on as to what to say to our group [noise] my goodness wow so that was a little story that got through her\nAttorney Brian hatch is our gas from Adel barrel and uh when you have a question or comment you could give us a call at five only to chew and chew\nThirteen twenty we're talking about are the real danger of a compressor station we're talking about what happened up in the end over north Andover and Lawrence and how that affects this whole issue\nUm what else can you tell us about the possibility at this time I guess the major major\nI'm a part of this is that the uh\nThe gas officials are seeking funding correct how much money do they need to to move this forward is that really their issue I mean you said they owned the land down there um what prevents them from moving forward right now\nWell at this point uh I don't know how many there were several billion dollars that they needed to go forward here and they did try to um put an end around the funding situation by actually taxing\nUh electricity and gas consumers huge company um spectra was the ritual energy company formulating this idea of bottle by Enbridge an even bigger company based in Canada\nUm you know Canada is going to receive a lot of this gas that they're in a proposing to increase going through Massachusetts\nSo really it's a a a conduit for profit for this and bridge company going to Massachusetts because it isn't going to benefit Massachusetts wrote\nAbsolutely okay\nYou know Massachusetts because it isn't going to benefit Massachusetts wrote\nAbsolutely okay\nUh we will entertain your thoughts are five oh wait Jews urging

for the penalties that they suffer\nAnd then come out of it I'm eager to go on and just keep on plugging but one thing that I've been looking at with these pipeline explosions up in Lawrence is that\nIt reveals both the inadequacy of the pipeline ... infrastructure in Massachusetts plus both the fact that repairing those ancient pipelines could cause an explosion which is what happened up there and\nBy applies could cause an explosion which is what happened up there and so you either if you replace it with modern infrastructure your wrists explosions or if you keep on pumping more gas into your wrist explosions and these companies can afford this litigation and\nUh they should compensate those residents up there are that's for sure mhm okay we are going to\nTake a short break we're

requires any digging\nA masters or whether it be a resident or contractor to ah any any a contractor or personal digging in the soil a weather on private or public property as to report this to an agency called ... which is part of the commonwealth um [noise]\nUh and you'll be able to contact them through the state website I\nHave some information that you can contact them through and but they have to get um [noise] they have to get an inspector come out and make sure that the gas lines are going to be\nA contacted by any digging and they do have gas lines marks but sometimes those marks aren't easy to find and the contractors very often you have back close just digging in a lawn and\nThey cut through that gas line spark can ignite the gas on there's a leak and buy a new house blow up\nExactly and I think a lot of residents in Alabama remember was it Ninety nine Ninety\nEight Ninety Ninety eight and um people in my area and most people in a row hold with a out of or a line or

because of this explosion\nAs people remember that the you know they were well loved and the city they just happened to be in the wrong place\nAt the wrong time I think two of them are one of them had only gone there to give a cup of coffee to some of the workers there and just because they were there at that time\nWhen it all blew up or they were killed they weren't even really on duty as I recall a which is just such a tragedy um but anyway\nUh that's kind of are the dangers of what happens or if like what you're saying contractors have\nTo report anything that they do with digging or any kind of work with gas lines correct\nThat try to just to go back a second with parts of yours field believe\nIt or not if your policy Hewitt field and you look through the woods about Seventy five yards or so in the woods that's where the compressor station would go really do you find\nIt such an ironic sadly ironic situation where a compressor station would be a spewing emissions right over a ball field name after two individual who were killed by a gas explosion in Nineteen Ninety eight um [noise]\nBut as as you were mentioning on this big save program requires\nBut as as you were mentioning

T. S. T. [laughter] although I wouldn't call it that at the time um but I had the classic symptoms of waking up at night screaming my poor roommate but he understood his father was a Vietnam vet\nSo he was actually a very soothing uh presidents I ah startle easily with loud noises I remember one time um some some jerk thought it would be funny to drop a big book in the middle of the hall and yell and coming round hit the deck\nAnd I scattered a bunch of chairs\nAnd when I came back up there was a murder in my eyes I grab that guy by his neck lifted I'm up against the wall tell them that if you ever did that again I Would kill him [laughter]\n\nI never saw him again for the next three and a half years of my college degree I think I saw a little blurb every once in a while I feel blurt run off\nInto the distance and I think it was him seeing me and turning in the other direction I tailing it\nUm but I Would go to physics class and I'm the first segments on ballistics and I asked that that semester because boy did I Know ballistics\nAnd people would ask me Henry how is it that you know you know exactly or the the answers to all of these questions are really hard I said brothers and sisters it's because I Lived it\nSo the song was or was popular during that time it kind of helped ease my\nIt was a was popular during that time\nIt kind of helped ease my um [noise] my jitters as it were as time went on I realized that was no longer in a war zone that I was relatively safe I'm surrounded by a bunch of college students are definitely a lot older than them\nSurrounded by a beautiful young ladies who thought I was very handsome [noise] unfortunately I was a lot older than they were in I was not going to take advantage of that situation and I did not I never did\nUm and I can take that to the bank\nThis music and being an environment with soothing and and it took about a year or two\nBut slowly but surely the symptoms went away and uh I came out you know okay I ... finished college got my degree and or the future truly truly was was bright for me and I'm grateful so very grateful for that opportunity\nOur economy is still pumping along I tell you I've I've had I had this segment um\nYesterday or the day before it probably would not have been a gotta wear shades it would've been something else but I'm the good news is\nIs that uh we had a rally in the market yesterday so the market roast four hundred and thirty two points um and there's a segment on CNN Business kinda funny for me to quote CNN but in in business says that ah the bull markets not over yet\nNow this year we've also had the largest number of concurrent down days since two thousand and eight what what that means is we've had a lot of tips and\nI'm usually the throughout the year you'll have days where the market is up and you have days where the market is down but this is the year where we've had the most number of consecutive down days since since two thousand eight\nWe've had the most number of consecutive down days since since two thousand eight that usually um you know forecasts the trend\n[noise] they said that uh if the stock market goes down about ten percent that say what's called a correction a stock market correction\nNot what a stock market correction is is when the market has basically been been bed a little bit too high the values of the stocks are perhaps unrealistic and people decide you know what I'm gonna take a little bit of my money off the table and so that's exactly what they do they they sell their stocks and\nThey take that money and they either by other stocks or they transferred over to cash\nAnd death trap to help advance China's geopolitical agenda\nSo there was a country in Africa or where China agreed to build a state of the modern marine port\n[noise] the the the term seem reasonable the port was\nThe the the term seem reasonable the port was built the projections for Traficant income into this port did not materialize\nThe government government stuck with basically an albatross so the Chinese government moved in and says will take over the operation guess what the Chinese now have a beautiful modern military port in Africa [noise]\nHow many more fools do they have to be before people wise up to the fact that this is a way for the Chinese government to establish a Gemini\nAnd they're part of the world and if not further here's us in there you know I like to I like to spend these scenarios and and because I'm\nA slightly paranoid or I'll I'll admit I Am kind of paranoid person sometimes\nI imagine this is a belt and road initiative is doing well\nLittle by little China is building ports ... ah airports all around the area\nAnd they've also been little by little buying up farmland in New Zealand and that's by the way this is they are doing this more and more farmland being sold to Chinese corporations to for for for farming um and then the products are exported\nThere comes a point when there's no food being produced for the local market it's all being exported think think of what happened in India during World War two and then in Ireland uh during the ... the famine\nAnd the newly New Zealand does decide wait a minute we are starving meanwhile all of our land has been has been shifted to production to feed the Chinese enough of this and they take over Lance the Chinese government through the use of their airports\nAnd they take over Lance the Chinese government through the use of their airports and they're they're they're wonderful ports all paid for by US dollars and that's another story\nInvade New Zealand take over a couple of the cities and say we're here to stay to protect our interests New Zealand has just lost its identity is a country hadn't it has now become\nA Chinese colony and short of the United states going in declaring war on China to try to wrest control back\nFrom a from the Chinese New Zealand theirs are done as a country you think oh

second I'm a vegetarian so again I'm not going to eat meat but let's say for the sake of of argument that I Want to eat a salami [noise]\nThe way you eat a salami is a slice at a time that's how the Italians are served their prosciutto right they don't give you a whole hunk of of salami and say here you go you know bite into it they give you a little slices that little slice here a little slice there before you know you've eaten ten pounds of that stuff\nThat is the Chinese government's way of conquering its corner of the world is going to do it a salami slice at a time an island\nIn the south China Sea here another island there militarization here belt and road initiative the creation of a very modern porch that they can then take over\nLittle by little they're going to establish the Gemini and anybody that's got half a brain hopefully I can see what's the writing on the wall\nAnd President Trump thank goodness does see the writing on the wall and and he has said no mas\nThank goodness does see the writing on the wall and and he has said no mas this far and no further we cannot afford\nTo allow the Chinese government to to establish these kinds of controls because they will come a point in my friends\nYou know America is strong now but they will come a point when the Chinese will be as strong as us if not stronger and they're part of the world remember our our armed forces are dispersed throughout the world all they have to focus on is in the south China Sea and they're kind of immediate environment\nAnd they cannot number is locally five ships to one and a no matter how modern airships aren't harvest of your forces are when you're out number five to one you've got to fight on your hands especially you know if they've got good weapons and the Chinese do don't don't full yourselves\nThey they have copied our weapons weapons or at least as good as ours because they are ours\nThat story for another day and so\nIt's only a matter of time unless we make a stand now\nUnless we alert our allies now of what's happening and finally people that are kind of waking up and going wait a minute this this sweetheart deal it comes with strings attached and these are not strings either chains doesn't know how to deal with strings or change the types of these deals\nIn the ... China has acquired several pilots in the heavily indebted Indian Ocean are probably go while the terms of various lease agreements have not been disclosed the acquisitions have come cheap for example China paid just four million dollars for Faye do food and won an island that previously served as a police training center\nThere's another base\n... experience has been a wake up call for other countries with outsized that's the China\nA number of B. R. I. partner states have begun trying to negotiate their deals with Beijing\nA number of B. R.

R. I. railroad project by two billion\nThese countries are starting to realize that by doing business or by taking in his belt a road initiative they're basically seeding their sovereignty to China because they're never to bleed these promises of of these great a cash cash cows\nThat they're not happening they're not going to happen countries are going to be stuck with these white elephants stuck with the debt\nAnd China's gonna make them pay one way or the other either you pay your debt so we're going to come in with our military forces and basically take over what's ours\nVis vis this is going to happen and at that point I think there will be war\nAnd I guess I have a warning every like every week now I'm I'm issuing a warning if you are someone or some political authority in China or if you are a friend or you have a friend or know of someone\nWho knows someone else tell this\nTo your Chinese government friends we are watching you you may be able to get away with it for a little while longer but not for much longer it will come a point when they will be a reckoning when we\nHave had enough of the salami slicing and we're going to grab your hand and said no more you've had enough salami and if you try to cut off another slice were basically\nYou've had enough salami and we tried to cut off another slice we're basically going to cut off your arm you don't mess with the United states of America you don't mess with us when we've said in a nice way that's enough\nBecause there comes a point when our resolve becomes ... and when that happens the next step is going to be under obliteration\nDo not underestimate the capacity of Americans we left to fight and we are fighters when our backs are against the law we will fight and we will fight with everything we got [noise]\nWe'd rather not fight we'd rather trade just like the average Chinese on the street you know Chinese on the street doesn't want to fight us ... they want to come to America they want to start businesses they want their kids to come here\nLet's trade let's do business let's figure out ways to make money let's let's help each of our families\nBut if war is the option that was what you're going to get over that\nBCC ... college one oh one will be held on Thursday November fiftieth\nFrom two thirty PM till four thirty PM attending students will learn how to apply to any college they will be instructed on the college application process from start to finish attendees will also learn about meeting application deadlines applying for financial aid finding an applying for scholarships right in the college essay and getting college recommendations\nThe average time a resume spends on an age or managers desk is seven seconds and most of them are tossed aside now imagine if one of those resumes belong to you as a man who was\nLiving in a shelter juggling three I have to be something that you can't\nOr is that resume was from someone who\nWorked through our shifted there was like a company with my dad was Seventy two\nOne who were twelve hour shifts that there was like a company with my dad who Seventy two that taught me a work ethic that I care with me every day\nWe rely so much on a resume you could never tell the full story of someone growing up where I Do a lot of things could have gotten in the way of my goals but I learned to push through and that's what I bring to work every day\nSo maybe it's time we look beyond the resume and look to grabs of life\nIt's getting to the point where people just simply can't afford to work simply to pay their their medical and I know ...

on but these are the kinds of people that really want to just throw themselves into something Barker summed up all the research nicely in the interview\nJust throw themselves into something Barker summed up all the research nicely in the interview with Business Insider he said valedictorian valedictorian pardon me often go on to be the people who support the system they become part of the system but they don't change the system or overthrow the system [noise]\nSo are you young or you're passionate about something follow your passions this is the time to be bold\nWhen you're older it's difficult it's not impossible look colonel Sanders did it I'm Tom Watson did it right ... did it Thomas ... was a KFC um [noise] a Tom Watson was of IBM and wrote crock was famously [laughter] pardon me a McDonald's\nThey were all in their fifties in failing health like me [laughter] [noise]\nBut you don't have to wait till your fifties and almost all wash out if you're passionate about something dive into it make a commitment to learn as much as possible about about the things that you're passionate about\nNow I Know that some people are passionate about games and you know I'm Talking to a certain person intent\nAnd that's fine but don't just be passionate about playing the games learn how the games are made learn how the games are marketed and then create your own game and market your own game I had a friend when I was in college\n[noise] this was in the days the days of a floppy disks [noise] he would spend about four hours a week um shipping things I Would see him he would he would have these little cardboard on cargo down below sea what shoving to to floppy does uh he had to label maker slap a label on it and put it on a pile\nHe would do this for about four hours he had a pile of a box\nAll on it and put it on a pile he would do this for about four hours he had a pile of about three hundred floppy you know the individual I'm On the lips filled the floppy disk\nAnd one day I was curious I thought it was like I don't know business related he says no I'm off the clock this is my own my own personal stuff he says I could do it here 'cause it's quiet this isn't a biology lab\nAnd I said well what are you doing he says oh I created a game and I'm I'm I I posted my my game on a bulletin board for people to to play\nA on a trial basis but if they want it to the actual the full game it was it's five bucks for the game\nAnd so it cost me a dollar for the floppy doesn't for the postage so I make four dollars\nI'm looking there's two hundred this she just made eight hundred bucks that week I was amazed I don't know what what whatever became of this guy he's probably the head of some software corporation\nPlus it's wicked wicked smart I Hope so I Hope we didn't burn out he was only Seventeen and he used that money to fund you know his parents made it very clear that money is not for you you can get you can keep a portion of it but we're putting that money towards your college education for your for your college\nI'm sure he had that paid off in a year\nBut he was passionate about what he did and he never just kind of I'm just touched on things like if I talked about politics [noise] um which I did even then he would come back to the next week and said Henry I I did some research on what you talked about not remember those days there was no Internet\nIf you did research you have to go to the library and actually pick up books\nI'm an ... an pull information um you could you could get some information from the Web but it really wasn't that wasn't that much out there in terms of research and he would retail me with all the details that he picked up I mean it was deep\nI like to think that might my knowledge has kind of slightly deep but but but wide\nMy knowledge has kind of slightly deep but but but why his was very narrow but extremely deep he really wanted to learn everything there was to know about a certain topic that he took an interest in and so\nIf you are passionate about something if you like to work with wood didn't learn about woodworking invest in tools\nTake it to a ticket to the to the next level do as much as you can as much as possible with that would that skill and kind of see where it takes you because it may very well just minimum make you're good at working with what\nBut it may be a business that that shows up um you could be someone who's really interested in metal work you may very well discovered that you're very good at finding at allies at figuring out allies and you go to college and you you you major in metallurgy and you discover the next you know super cable that will allow us\nTo um to create that space elevator 'em or something else but but if you're just someone who kind of goes along and just do what you have to to to get by you're never going to achieve that that that that level\nThat rewarding plateau of of your of your career because there's always something more that you can do with your career look I'm I'm an an older man\nAnd here I Am pushing [noise] shouldn't be pushing as much as I can take measured risks in my career um have launched many businesses [laughter]\nMost have failed some have done pretty well for a couple of years and um then I'd have to move on but you just can't stop you have to keep pushing forward and and this article really brings that out sure if you want a comfortable living then been become a nurse you know\nSure if you want a comfortable living then been become a nurse you know two year degree um you can work as a nurse and you pretty much can work anywhere in the in the money is good it's a it's a good career\nUm but if you want to change the world take stock of what you're good at because everyone every single one of us\nHas been gifted with something truly extraordinary\nSometimes it's lying dormant within us other times it kind of shows a little bit\nMy my talent isn't telling stories I Love to tell stories uh like I can I can spin a wicked yard or give me the time and give me an audience and I can I can definitely tell a funny story or an interesting story inspirational story scary stories on and so forth\nUm it's a talent I'd still need to develop it what is your talent\nAnd once you've discovered what your talent is what are you going to do with your talent\nWe'll be right back with

Believe\nReally outstanding for one thing or another you know we the historically significant or architecture really significant and um it's usually you know a\nAttended by a lot of people are going to say it's any well attended young what I've heard I haven't actually been on this one myself and I've always heard that they should kind of John should see I'm I'm sure it'd be very interested in in a lot of that it's a and I'm sure it will take years and years before you run out of new properties to show because there are quite a few\nIf anyone's interested if they've got a historical house and they want to put it on how store please give me a call also um there are plenty of old houses in ... but um it doesn't seem as though people\nThere are plenty of old houses in outer borough but um it doesn't seem as though people are that apt to allow us to use their houses as much as it used to be so sometimes it's tied getting houses but if anybody's interested give me a call\nAgain I mean that's exactly what we're here for the ... people know how how they can get involved in unity to help but you know to help\nHelp preserve because I mean we've all seen as young as we drive around New England there's some communities that really have gone all out and trying to preserve a everything and anything that that they can um\nI Know that we had a you know some issues in the past you remember when we were talking about ... ah what did we caught historical rode\nThe scenic rode on Minnick wrote ordinance yeah that would that we batted around for years and years and years and years and I'm nodding off the council for for years as the as anything ever actually come of that as\nI Know we pretty well\nPut it aside let's say yeah I'm not sure whether about what we'll come back or not but um it's just something that the Massachusetts historical commission suggested that local historical conditions use as a tool to preserve the history [laughter] so that's why we wanted to try and get it on the books but there's just no way out all the time no it doesn't\nAnd unfortunately as time goes on to become fewer and fewer roads that probably sort of meet the criteria that\nAre feeling through buildings we all we have to one of the things we strive for is to find new uses for old buildings and hearing about we've really done a good job with that you know there's a lot of buildings that have been a change totally from what they were originally to you know like the sweet house the first may is houses literacy sent\nYou know the fire station is the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just these great new uses for old buildings that need to remain standing and be a Potter by heritage\nNow and why not just like finding something\nAnd remain standing and be a part of our heritage\nRight now and why not just like finding something to do with the building the good good musicians and it's it's making good utilization delivers the Senate building gets so much so much you send that's gorgeous building it really it\nReally is and it's well built ... you know on they don't build 'em like\nThey used to I think that's one of the kids are why a lot of the properties of survives over the years is that they really work so well built compared to some of the stuff we see today\nYup my house as strong as anything he go to bang bang a nail into those signs beams ... and ... you bend the nail over [laughter]\nThat's pretty good I I met one of the difficulties people have when they said they they buy it all the property like that and they want to stay with the historical seem ... make it seem timely\nIt must be difficult sometimes to get materials and stuff that match up with the time Ira especially when you get further back\nThere's lots of businesses out there now that really concentrate on that and and not you know pride themselves and being available with all of restoration materials that you need and especially now that you are on line getting everything it doesn't matter where it is you can get it Mm well that's good to hear yeah oh yeah yeah\nSo what other activities besides the historical commissions society what other stuff have you been involved in over the years there and I'm sure there's a lot of what I said\nI Belong to those two things but I also belong to da act and we're very we're very very proud of our little pack house the Seventeen twenty three house on on the corner of Elizabeth and knocked me that's early and then my house\nIs now that that's basically it right across the CBS yes it is for people want the snow you want to tell us a little but what about what the DARE some of the people out there might not be familiar with the organization\nDARE is a national organization and Arab Ross chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started hearing Massachusetts back in ...\nAnd Adam roast chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started here in Massachusetts back in Nineteen oh one and uh it has to do with your genealogy mostly you have to prove that you are related to and I are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary war and uh you you have to go through all of the genealogy to prove that and then this what this this group does themselves as we try to preserve patriotism and we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we try to um\nPraise the students who are into history and that type of thing uh but it's uh like I said it's a national organization\nThat's really written it and it's the chop the here's been since Nineteen all one yes it has well that's a that's a long well established ... yes and no did you get involved with that when you first moved to the community\nIs again it was when I was trying to track the history of my house and so um that that was one of the groups that I joined also but I'm also a member of the ... museum I oil paint I don't know if everybody knows that HUD and I sell my paintings\nYet so I'm I Do oil paints and um I can do them to order you've been anything all your life\nYou know I started hearing about the seventies and for ... the older folks that are watching this um maybe they remember either race either race was an art teacher here in ... I took from her for ten years so um and I did things like on adult beds and and uh all the local things summer school at ... high and\nTwo for the ap courses that's really neat yeah and then I also belong to the triborough called that club\n[noise] oh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original member of the clubs started forty years ago this this year coming and um we've got a Nineteen sixty two Corvette and we've had about thirty eight years and we um\nAnd we've had it for thirty eight years and we um\nWill start you know yeah thirty ... yes and um we love to go out and ride around in it and we've got a lot of a good friends in the core that club and it's great fun still\nYou must get to meet a lot of people you know when all those shows top people are good people that's great yeah that's where it's no there any uh activities and the community that you've thought about getting involved with it maybe haven't yet had the time or\nI think I've really between my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight grandchildren and one and a half great grandbabies wow so um that takes up you know\nA lot of time to move your ana yes so I think I'm actually involved in enough things winter without any more snow\nAgain when you when you first moved out of ... and you interested in researching the history of your house um that led to getting involved in community activities but um I think today\nThere are a lot of people out there that I find it a little bit harder to get involved in the community there not quite you know the the lifestyles of so much busier they work out of town um you have a suggestion for people who are thinking about jihad us you know I'd like to get involved with something that\nKnow when you started to say that something went through my head and it was something that my chemistry teacher in high school said to me and I've never forgotten it you always find the time to do the things you really want to do [laughter]\nYeah okay so if somebody really wants to do it there's so many things available in outer borough I mean there's a genuine allergy club at the library that does the YMCA has all these programs the library has a whole bunch of programs and then all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um\nEven even when you've worked at the factories this I I actually belong to the bell for retirees to the Goldwater schools\nThat's just because I worked out for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in ...\nBecause I worked out for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in outer borough and you know if somebody really wants to do what they find a way so\nOkay so\nYou have any you know well is that people who\nAre saying they they think the city should do this the city should do that do you have any things that you you would like to see the city maybe trend to do more of that maybe we're not right now\nI think the city's doing pretty good I think everything looks terrific I like some of the um\nThe like the lamp posts I'd like the lamp post their their ... and and not brings back the character of the city that we we have had and and that proves where we came from we have to know where we came from to know where we're going so\nWell absolutely especially I think in the holidays with the lights and I think it really does add a a certain New England homey feel kinda to it\nI'm One of the things that you know we think about a historical stuff in the city is one of the things I think of is like Cape in park you know I mean they don't build ... they don't make parks like that anymore you know it's basically the ones that exist exist and it's unlikely that in the future they'll develop um\nBut uh we saw recently there was this talk about um [noise]\nRenovating some of the monuments and there are extensively wonderfully well more up have you been involved in all of that or do you know anything you might be the ad about that that\nOne of the Memphis about commission is on that committee so that he is our liaison between it um it's it's a Beautiful Mind unit it's the most beautiful monument in the city and um it needs a lot of care and maintenance and um if they can raise the money to do it that would be great ... I can remember\nYou know as a little kids you know forty years ago over the plane and the puck on the monument and you know I think it was sort of somewhat old in weathered at that point\nWhere in mining on it now I we've we've\nIt was sort of some old and whether it's at that point in my own on it now I we we probably were which is probably ... led to getting the condition um but but there are so many", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Attleboro", "day": "30"}
