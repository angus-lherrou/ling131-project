thing has loads of moisture so it's still almost like a hurricane just without a lot of strong winds and that's why I'm afraid some of the moisture this weekend will get injected up the coast\nAnd the potential for some a street flooding perhaps windswept rains on Saturday again right now if you have plans this weekend a and you can maybe you ought to them and say you know what I was going to do this this week and a and I wanted to be outside and good weather\nAll to them and say you know what I was going to do this this week and a and I wanted to be outside and good whether you might want to maybe hold it off until maybe next weekend because Sunday will still have some showers no Sunday will be not quite as cool as Saturday Saturday like staying in the middle forties for time\nAh so it'll be sort of an early grade a really season low grade kind of a cold rotten rain but this time of the year Sunday uh mid fifties so still cool but not as cool as Saturday showers and some lingering range and the Monday as a second area of low pressure will be coming up\nTemperatures will be in the fifties then I still think Halloween is going to be dry or with sunshine during the day no more this time of course as I said the last quarter moved by next Wednesday or with temperatures in the fifties so there is some good news right now for Halloween itself next Wednesday a week from today yeah week from today Halloween\nOr the weather at this point it looks dry against sunset at uh ten minutes of six and just after that we'll see that movie come up\nOnce again and it will be shining over everything tonight or the yesterday situation again we had a lot of turning a loft usually this time of the year we get this that stays above the ground several thousand feet will this time it came within a few hundred feet and that's why a lot of rotation\nThe video of the water spots in of course nowadays because everybody on earth basically has a camera with them otherwise known as the cell phone you see this more often so some of these things that we saw yesterday Tom probably Twenty years ago might not have been physically seen because ah not many people had\nCameras on them all the time so that stuff by the uh second more bridge with a born rich and also\nUh the the uh water spouses well off of a point Judith ... not far off of a horse neck beach there was some video of force neck beach of\nThe water spout quite unusual but if you remember during\nEarly a few weeks ago I talk about how this season\nQuite unusual but if you remember during early a few weeks ago I talk about how this season is kind of like looking like what it did back in Nineteen Seventy nine\nAnd remember when I talk about what happened and Windsor locks Connecticut that year in October the devastating tornado there no certainly not like what we had yesterday I mean there were no ...\nThis these are probably going to become a called F Farrow at the worst one that Windsor locks tornado in October Seventy nine a was a an F three and a half for I mean the devastated buildings killed a few people\nAre but again we're shaping it's looking like this type of weather pattern where everything is delayed a little bit so I Know a lot of people are a few people ask me yesterday evening briefly ah as I was just outside looking around at the skies\nA boy this is unusual for this time of year what we had an and I said yes it was but it does happen on rare occasions and I brought up to them Nineteen Seventy nine and of course person I was talking to probably wasn't even born in Nineteen Seventy nine the point being\nThis is somewhat of a replay and the good news you know what's going on now gone up in much of central in northern Maine\nYeah they uh they got a little snow up there\nA little more than a little ah they're going to get a six plus inches outside of the coast it looks like and again that's around a while almost the press Kyle now but holds and Mila knock at Bangor has gone between rain and snow as their little closer to the coast\nBut inland a main getting to know now you say okay well it's snowing in Maine who cares it's up there but that's an indication again even there that's a little unusual and what do I talk about all the time over the years when you have these early season events\nThis time it's a snow of in shaping up I'm Still thinking this is going to be a winter they're just not going to have a lot of snow and we see this many years where and this might be the classic example Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty tornadoes in October or early ...\nThe nine Nineteen eighty tornadoes in October\nOr early snow in much of it when we get flurries that October here no accumulation\nOr late in October and we had almost no snow the entire winter so this is another\nBackup or of ... you know not to diminish what happened yesterday but it's one more clue as to why I think we're not going to have a lot of snow this winter we could be very well\nRoughly replay in Nineteen Seventy nine in Nineteen eighty so we're now right now and what was going on and I look back at the records and it's quite similar we got a few colds fells like we've had we've had a hint of snow we had some warm days and I think a couple of days next week might\nApproach sixty five degrees we could be making a replay of Seventy nine and a the fall of Seventy nine the winter of Nineteen eighty\nA course that meant to January February march nineteenth heat and that went to was very ... in a\nThere'll be people that were rejoicing were those that have snow and ah

still I think the best day overall for the rest of the week because they won't be much wind\nUpper forties rain and winds are moving in a coastal storm for the weekend right now not the best of weather for outdoor activities or whatever are the good deals at least at this point it still looks like it will be storm free for Halloween one week from today and I'm update later in the ...\nAre it sounds good gym banks once again hey also in a as a as we keep on telling people that less than a week now oh I'm actually less than two weeks I should say is the election\nAnd ah once again we are going to be talking with some of the other candidates who are running for city council and I'm\nOne of the other gentleman who is actually been with us before a couple of times is a young gentleman who I got to know I'm a since he's been here in our studio nickel boy\nI now he is joining us once again in a studio for was ah once again I mean you just see what they want to hear from African number five okay I went to the alright good morning that guy you doing today more than ... I'm going to tell you I'm doing well uh\nUh so uh this is a few times that you've been with us here in the studio it's nice to see you again you can continue as well\nUm well first of all you're running for city council that large the seat vacated by Julie hall you tie and John are all running in that uh in that campaign\nFirst off a let me congratulate you first saw on being the top ... a name on the balance or I have to say how did that feel when you saw that\nUh you know it definitely feels good it is hard to\nWhen you saw that uh you know it definitely feels good it is hard to kind of get your hopes up you know ... and rely on something like that but it's always a good feeling it's um\nDefinitely something that never works against here so I mean you hope to get there and if you don't you plan accordingly so I think you know even the other two are probably just happy there on the ballot and a happy that you know they can get the word out for themselves as well so I guess if I tried to make it like a\nToo big of a thing but it's definitely a good feeling um it's a little ease off probably the most nerve wracking thing at city hall sat through yeah it's just the you know the the ballots and all that so\nI also watching some of the city council meetings or you have been attending a lot of the council meetings to kind of get your feet wet a little bit here um when you see some of the uh the veterans out there I mean what what's what's um you know you've watched them on television you've been at at some of the meetings or live and for\nWhat is the ... what is what is the way to go through your mind when you're seeing some of these uh these men and women talking about these different issues which you know and hopefully one day you'll be there hopefully in the new year you know what's what's going through your mind when you see these things coming up on a dock it's\nWell you know um yeah I I've attended ... you know I think the last probably it's got to be near twenty now and except last night I wasn't there last night um but but the last twenty or so between committee and count so I've been out I Try to\nAttend the mall since I really got into it full scale um [noise] but yeah I think it's it's great to see that there is a good vested interests in the better of outer borough\nI think that a lot of people now are starting to see the potential that a lot of us knew were there um you know the just across the street down there and the river walk and we have that property they're going to look to clean up in the easiest thing chronicle person that they're going to have you know a whole urban redevelopment downtown\nAnd the easiest thing chronicle person that they're going to have you know a whole urban redevelopment downtown you know retail and apartments and these are things that people have talked about for years\nSo it's good to see a lot of the other counsellors started to realize it and that's why they get you know a great time for me to get on there and really push this further into work with them I think there's a good you know at least\nHalf of the council that are really on board with this whole thing now and I think getting someone younger on board that as a knowledge for is just going to push it even further so really reinforces why I Want to run\nYeah in a ... and with a lot of the things that are coming to the city as you mentioned uh the\nUh the Robin ... park over here you know cleaning up the rest of that area uh hopefully one in one of the days in the near future we'll see another of one of those renaissance buildings run it ran across the street there as well\nWeek on double ACS catch the federalist papers a presentation by professor dairy highland her than encompasses how these documents led to the passage of our constitution this is the first presentation in a false series presented at the original sin library north out of ... which focuses on famous papers in American history you can watch this program and all of us\nSo ... which focuses on famous papers in American history you can watch this program and all of our quality programs from around the area in high definition on the double ACS mobile out\nAll right back with us once again on this Wednesday morning are coming up to twenty minutes after the hour a beautiful morning out there we got forty three degrees nickel boy of course running for city council a with us in Studio this morning\nA when you were here I'm not too long ago a you're talking about um the other things that you want to uh you know a work on if if you ah get through with this this election a lot of them of course is huge uh with you on TALK a little bit about the education that you'd like as well\n[noise] yeah so education's huge for me I think it's definitely a vested interest\nIn everybody now I'd hate to say there never was but I think I'm going going through the school during you know budget crisis is where they don't have enough books or you\nKnow we had books that we couldn't take home a just teachers getting laid off to me it's just not a good environment I I Can't imagine being a teacher getting a pink slip and even if they have the job that teacher how good are they going to want to you know teach everybody now it's kind of a bitter taste so I really started to\nA passion for for a round men because like I said I've been through all these issues firsthand and when they came around showing all the photos of the high school and what's wrong with it and those are all things that were on when I was there\nSo I think it's important to have someone um that's been through the schools you know on the council for this reason and I think with me on you're going to find that\nI'm going to do everything I can to make sure flemings available I Know firsthand the two things that are always on the chopping block or a sports and then after school activities\nAnd um you know coaching for all these years those are things that I Know can't be caught 'em they're just\nYou know coaching for all these years those are things that I Know can't be caught 'em they're just they're a tool and outlet in you know\nBelieve it or not they're huge learning process for uh the kids you know you're teaching you know teamwork responsibility coaches are on the on the athletes the grades and these are important things that we can't cut and that like I said this isn't you know and I see an outlet it's something for someone who\nMight not have a great home life or even just someone that doesn't have a lot of friends or you know or doesn't socialize well these are tools to put them in the place to do that or to give them a safe environment\nUm growing up that was it was always something\nYou know I Love doing was sports I played baseball football it's the team aspect you're making new friends and you're also you know I mean I was always competitive but I didn't\nAt first and there are socialized ally and then that built into where now I'm outgoing guy everybody knows and just things like that are are huge Jimmy special education it's you know giant arms to me as well we have such a good program and you know I'll never undermined all that will never\nLet the funding cut out fight to the last birthday I have in the council to not let those funding to get caught\nI think um as you as last time we were talking and then we've talked to a couple a gentleman from the school committee not too long ago\nUm you know just seeing the plans for the new high school I mean is is is just amazing when it's gonna I mean state of the art and um I think uh it's it's got to be a ... I think it's going to be a great asset to the city as well\nYeah I'm I'm very excited about the a C team all yeah getting those groups involved I feel like now it's top especially with the security concerns and you know everything else but I think that's huge and you know there's so much potential with that wing and um I Know and I'd\nThat's huge and you know there's so much potential that wing and\nUm I Know when I had talked before about maybe bring it back like the ones in a market or some some more getting those groups involved is huge and\nI'm keeping the high school involved directly with the city's as great as well they've done a good job now and I think having the CAT weighing where students can really dipped their feet and do what they want to go into to me that's you know\nCrucial you know and the other thing is you know even at the high school and this is amazing that they've even when you were there and they've had this for a long time [noise]\nAh with the commentary arts you know you've got the the blue pride bistro\nAre they going to be hosting the um the finale dinner tomorrow night uh at the high school at the at the for the big read 'em and I mean when you went to the school you know was always there\nAnd it's just amazing that these Connery kids or you know ... of doing wonderful job in fact they've been doing this now for a long long time as I talk about it on the air not too long ago\nA back in the eighties early nineties I remember in fact I was talking to 'em a couple of ... students a few months ago\nA still I'm Still doing uh making and baking cakes and they can you know you can go in there and basically purchase a cake for a birthday party and adverse or whatever and I was I was talking to one of the people out there in one of their instructors\nHave they've they've been doing this for a long long time now you know and he was telling me that um you know you have okay you've got the Johnson and Wales cuisine and all that and the ... and everything\nBut you don't realize that our borough is almost second to none to Johnson and Wales 'cause a lot of people don't realize that you can purchase birthday cakes anniversary cake student uh\nFrom there from ... from the school as well\nI uh I I Know I always see their posts around um holidays where they do the big order ends up I think you know ... and I remember\nAnd um holidays where they do the big order and stuff I think you know and ... and I remember going through that they do a ticking sport program in freshman year where they um they you don't get all of them you get a good vast majority of all the little programs\nOn remember going through there as well and you know is awesome kitchen and they had a good ... they have great staff and I'm definitely an awesome experience that I think you know when I was in I did electrical so we did repair some stuff for them as well and\nI'm always everything always look good and they smell good I'm definitely jealous seven days of the student walking by going to get lunch and you see all the Jersey and the house and we'll get a ... um but yeah I think the you know programs like that are great and\nUh I have someone I went to school with um play football if ah actually you know they worked at scorpions or the head Chevy ... for a while\nAnd now he lives in Germany the chef out in Germany and the you know he came from that program that you know that starts a passion\nBecause ninth grade a lot of people even eighth grade going into it a lot of people will still wondering what they want to deal with life you know an heck those people in college wondering what they want to deal with life you know yeah so and to see a jumpstart things like that is why those programs are crucial\nOr other than you know why you want to be city councilor will get into that and just a couple of minutes um\nI I see you're wearing a great a great sweatshirt for the right side of the elites champions\nUm you know um that that is another big passionate view we talked about this last time you were here um other than working for the city of Arab or what you want to do in the near future what are some of the other passions that you do on your days off as well\nSo for me I ... I'm doing great stuff for the red Sox you know we're not working for them but our but be wearing these these shirts that they just they just purchased\nAnd but our but be wearing these the shirts that they just they just purchased but you know you're a huge sports fan as\nOh yeah well I Wish I were to the red Sox I hopefully hopefully the next week I'd have a nice ring or the off season but\nUm yeah sports are are huge me I'm always always involved in you know just every sport locally and ah I coach basketball uh didn't coach football this year when I got hit by a drunk driver I got a knocked out of the batch of being able to coach\nSo that kind of hurt me a little bit but I I Am doing basketball Marty signed up you know to coach again or this November and through usually ended about January ... be\nA won the championship last year hoping to do the same as here too in a row and when we lost the first time by one point our breaker but um and then we won last year but yeah I'm just very passionate about uh sports\nI tried to get back on the youth level because I feel I'm being they jam kids need a mentor big brother figure you know even just just a good year to listen and someone that can relate to problems are going through um so that's you know passionate for me and you know I like the outdoors as well so the outdoors a passionate\nUm [noise] you recently came back from the great outdoors as well recently as well\nYeah I'm white I wanted to go up to New Hampshire this fall you know the leader of the ... you know it's crazy but uh yeah I you know I booked why when the New Hampshire last year\nMay I went down to the Caribbean and that's different for me I'm not like a very tropical person but it's beautiful down there\nUm violent or WorldCom I fell in love with its up the coast of Honduras yeah but that's only a traveling outdoors um you know my girlfriend is a vet tech so we she's all about animal so it coincides well because I'm always we're always out and about what actually\nSo we she's all about animal so it coincides well because I'm always we're always on about what actually go into um an hour watching a November ... at the end of course again remember the name now to a research facility in ... but they have like\nThis huge it's like twenty something miles and trails and you know they give you a set thing at night they do it every year and they teach you how to find them once they tell you how to find out you'd be surprised how easy it is you know like this way you look for this is the time of year\nAnd you go out there you know oh there is you know ten of them however I never seen this before in my life it's but yeah to stuff like that I like I said I Love the outdoors I Love traveling sports is huge for me um fishing as well\nYou know being that I Am so young and devoted I think that I'll have the mentality the know how long it's taken a drive it's going to take a ... that comes with anything in life you know\nSports as well I use a lot of what I Do based on coaching and sports it's you know sometimes you get a kid that's not easy\nHe's a lot of what I Do based on coaching and sports it's you know sometimes you get a kid that's not easy to were not you know doesn't not comfortable someone's downtown right now as a coach or when you got to work at it\nUm you know build the trust with the community and it's it's something that we are going to get done and I think that's what she used to have me on there is\nUm someone that knows what's the issues plaguing you know the the youth or a future generations and it's someone that knows that drive that it's going to take to get things done but also I'm young and you know I Will make sure it gets done before my time's up you know\nWe um we haven't heard any of people out there on the phone down but we do have a somebody out there on email right now and it's a good friend Pete Dye eggs from a job is\nUh we love wrecking his girlfriend here in ... a great guy a and that's exactly what a lot of people as I have heard a lotta times are being out and about that uh people do see you are a lot of times um you you get out the you try to get out there as much as you can do\nYeah I really do and I'll be on that later today\nYesterday was a tornado warning that didn't work out his plan [laughter] um yeah I really I Try to imagine some of the science fly all over the first worry I think every time I watch the weather and getting on my girlfriend could ah\nAttest to that someone has like a whole bunch and they'll be All right but there's a hurricane the part of it's going to clip batter borough or part of it's in that clip Massachusetts I'm like what part of my son is going to be okay that's my big worry and I'm always driving around making sure they're OK\nUm but yeah it's you know it you realize how big the city is in a one thing I really tried to do is hit the town line hard and it's not about to me it's about getting people involved um so I think the people that are in the town line all of them I talked to the no one's ever been here and you know I'm Glad to be the first because\nOn line autumn I talked to the no one's ever been here and you know I'm Glad to be the first because these people need to be involved in we we should never\nDisenfranchised anybody in the city and I I don't think it's people that you know I think oh well they're out there will just get the core group but I'm really trying to target people in South Alabama I'm really trying to target you know the working people um I Try to do stuff that's out of the box you know I was friday four to six\nI was out there and county square and you know\nWaiting for those working people to come on them and so to me those are the people that I Hope I can take care of and you know some of those people might want to open a business and it's\nYou know for me it's hopefully I can give them an opportunity so I think that's why you know I get a passion and you know friday night I'm Out there on the corner and county street or you know and I'll be doing I think this Sunday weather prevails I'll be up in\nA cell that burrows well I really just trying to reach out to everybody is the key thing\nThat's the other thing I was just going to ask you um you know a lot of times you know you you know you're you're you're seeing on counting square you know here in Edinburgh\nUm and I think south out over a lot of times people kind of forget in some of that area um you know or places like in front of the ... you know right there right in the middle of a heart of everything\nA little bit further down you know it's kind of kind of busy down by least pond and stuff like that\nBut you've got to get all those seem too because you know people come was kind of forget you've got you got a great school down they got you got to heal Roberson Coelho right in that area as well um you know and as I said you are huge on on education you want to get you want to get the name out there\nSo I think going into south outer boroughs sometimes as you mentioned that little while ago sometimes people forget it's almost you know even back in the sixties seventies eighties people's to say oh it's another\nYet it's almost an hour even back in the sixties seventies eighties people say oh it's another thing I live in South out of her own all you'll live it out over I'm In ... I had a gentleman who I knew very very well a number of years ago who came from South ...\nAnd he and he tells me and he told me many many times he's no longer with us anymore but he said yeah we live in South Alabama we all have on mend and rode we don't have anything to do it counting street or you know all the way a plus history but we live down\nBut you being a counselor at large\nYou've got to basically that is your job to do that if you if you become counselor large you know OK down there and that's all a ward one um you've got to basically your job is to take care of\nAll six warns the whole city as well yeah and I think\nI mean you really realize how big the city is when you start hitting the ground and you're looking at maps and you know but yeah I think to me I feel that solve that rose forgotten a lot and I live in that and I live in\nA more seek onsite admirable even I Know and now you're I'm insects your ethics sixty um and even I Know that South\nIs a little disenfranchised sometimes and that's why I made a big push to go down to like the you know the real far and brown street or um just the whole ... and castles the pockets down that way Yeah Yup Yup I was there\nUh we we can have to go to ... but uh yeah I think it's really important to to just get to these people\nAnd you know people that might feel forgotten or people that might not even just vote for the race because they feel like I Know one comes here and I think it's it's great to touch upon them I think it's great that they know I Do care about them because again\nYou know they're they have a lock on up there through one shopping wise um so it's really hard for them to relate issues downtown or\nIt's um so it's really hard for them to relate issues downtown or even though that affects their you know their taxes and when we don't get taxes that all these buildings that are vacant you know it might\nFall back on the citizens or does affect them I'm personally they don't feel it they don't drive by it every day so when you when people only and that's why education for me is big too but it's like\nYou know when you're only talking about downtown downtown which I Do a lot\nIt's hard to keep those borders in tune but again I Try to tell them hey this this affects your taxes and um you know this coincides with basically every budget in the city you know when you have vacant properties that aren't generating the tax you need them to that burden is going to fall back on the citizens so\nI think explaining math to them they're like oh okay yeah you know that makes so much sense so things like public safety in education which are two main concern for me\nThe business aspect drives those two and funds those too so you know they all coincide and it's you know one big\nJust circle of you know money and money out and I think it's like I said demonstrating that to them it's been huge for me and I think I'm open the light and a lot of people in South that ever with like wow yeah I guess downtown does really affect me even though I don't see it right All right\nThat we have a nickel void in Studio for a bit uh we're going to be taking a look at the forecast

Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor\nUm noted that that that the disease is in its early stages quote as this condition has progressed she adds I Am no longer able to participate in public life in her statement which was released to the Supreme Court O'Connor notes that she wanted to speak while I'm Still able\nAnd share some personal thoughts while the final chapter of my life with dementia maybe trying nothing has diminished my gratitude and deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life\nAs a young college girl from the Arizona desert I never could have imagined that one day I Would become the first woman on woman justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nUm the now eighty eight year old O'Connor was nominated by president Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty one the man who began the successful war on the working poor and middle class but that's a different story prior to her appointment O'Connor was a judge in a state lawmaker in Arizona\nO'Connor was seen as a key swing vote on the high court before her retirement in two thousand six and a sad post grip post script O'Connor's departure from the court\nAnd it's sad posts grip post script O'Connor's departure from the court was due to her husband's diagnosis of Alzheimer's she wanted to be able to care for him\nJohn O'Connor the third passed away in two thousand nine um say what we will and we do it's the talk show I'm

was and thank you for your a message I got a little later and uh although that was the the beauty of yesterday afternoon but there was the beast as well as I'm sure you've heard them\nWell before we get to the beast or could you tell from the voice mail message I left you that there was a tear in my eye gazing upon that beauty yesterday afternoon when I left that message\nWe ... yeah probably though were you hoping for a double pot of gold as well at the end of those two rainbows yes that might\nActually there was no part of gold just a couple of winning lottery tickets that's\nWhat it is you're held by the way that you hear about again the winning a lottery ticket was one person in South Carolina yeah which I Know you weren't happy to hear but here's the good news or a and you'll agree this was a good thing at least for this person the Lawrence South Carolina you don't have to wait and apply yourself\nThat's good for you know go ahead\nNo that's very good for them that's very very good for them because uh\nIt might be able to live a few extra years before you know you have family friends everybody else tries to go after him but\nBecause if you do want a lottery that big first thing you've got to do first thing you gotta do change your name fingerprints phone number address or erase the ratio prior existence so they can't come out of the woodwork I'm pleading for you to share share your wealth with them I Do encourage people to share their wealth\nBut it can be incredibly uncomfortable because everyone with all kinds of issues will contact you and look for in a handout but and we you know\nThe one with all kinds of issues will tell you and looks at her hand though but and we know we know handouts shouldn't come from lottery winners handouts you come from the government there it is five a way to to to went through two zero there's one for you folks come on we're balanced the\nWell anyway uh good luck whoever that is that you know at any rate uh we have cost the rainbows which I did not see but saw pictures of we also had a and I started to notice this Paul about one thirty yesterday afternoon I was out and I saw clouds are lower cloud spending the opposite direction of the low level wind direction\nAnd I was thinking to myself wow this is a we've got a lot of wind shear up there this is about one o'clock\nIn the closet moving in different directions and unfortunately I in all other forecasters were thinking this would stay well thousands of feet up in the atmosphere but the wind shear went right down almost to the ground and then of course it in one case so far or the weather service or ... ... right up the street or Norton as you say\nNo I'm\nA [laughter] they've moved from a cost taught in the last few months but no they were over there in Rhode Island and they did detect a albeit a small it's a sort of a baby tornado efforts arrow F. one at the most in Lincoln and also possibly north Providence if you know that area a write off the two Ninety five route seven\nOther Douglas turnpike that area a Saturday in Providence ... that's ... that's a hilly elevation and I'll get right to the forecast off but it looked to me it looks to me like a classic set up where the same feature that eventually moved through ... minutes later\nA but it was the same feature but it hit that the hilly train up around four or five hundred feet there in North Providence Lincoln\nAnd so it was able to hit the ground or get closer to the ground drawing up a couple of groups were damaged and they were able to terminals that was a tornado but what happened in ... and very ... about three miles down the road\nWere able to permanent that was a tornado the what happened in ... and very ... about three miles down the road from where I Am and yesterday afternoon that's that was passing through Norton or in other areas eastern or near the ... reservoir by the way off of Mansfield have their\nUh you could see the major rotation I'm saying wow this is definitely you could see it but it was in shrouded in rain now finally the pictures you saw we have the Scott where these storms will coming from I'm sure you might have seen the pictures of the video Paul and others did of ah from out of rain them\nOr where it really looked like a tornado in the distance the doctrinal because at that time there was no rain or an ... ability because these are what we call cold air funnels of already saw somebody asked me a ... last evening how ... how rare is it to get a tornado in October it is very rare\nAnd again it's a lot of it has to do with this unusual weather pattern Nineteen Seventy nine I think we're planning out\nA Nineteen Seventy nine to fall we had tornados in October here in southern New England with Windsor locks or which was a devastating tornado and also we had very warm abnormally warm waters we've got to hurricanes late season hurricanes that year and Seventy nine and they\nWere that was the least snowy is winter of the twentieth century so if all goes well for\nThose well that's because the mother nature you know kind of I'm kind of a well after Nineteen Seventy eight the blizzard of Seventy eight there wasn't much snow left anywhere in the atmosphere so it took a couple of years to build backup\nThat is true that sees in Seventy nine and eighty all ski areas in New England ... especially New England because it was a New England phenomena where almost even the mountains I almost had no snow\nSki areas that did not make snow or put in a lot of those are still making machines ... and from Nineteen eighty eighty one on a most curious are able to make snow now one more thing part I get to the forecasts are the mayor was on channel five late yesterday after\nOne more thing part I get to the forecasts are the mayor was on channel five late yesterday afternoon\nWhich marrying about mayor hero always on general was on and\nI just happen to flip it on if they came in as I was watching the Norton thing from your in Mansfield I'm like wow something's going on and ... mayor hero was on for a few minutes on channel five and he was in his office are telling the situation of the alerts went off Trump's send us all those alerts and so what happened was a\n... weather service centers high alerts no I\nI I Do just like he didn't send that one a couple of months ago right but at any rate well no but anyway I'm just joking but the alerts were sent out and he mentioned the up he got the alert and because adults are always in the tornado warning a path or is it just passed out of or he said there was a oh\nA small hill strong winds but the worst of it was right or in in ... not too far actually just up north I Believe from Wheaton College they are one forty so that's the area that was hit in ... now all this is bringing snow believe it or not this morning part two main\nOutside the big why supermarket I'm quite sure if that quite sure that uh and while you're thinking of better rainbow songs that double rainbow by Katy Perry would you also\nOf better rainbow songs that double rainbow by Katy Perry\nWould you also police consider\nDropping off a bag of candy for those wonderful little rotten little crushers who'll be at the Halloween swat re starting at I think at five o'clock this Friday night at the literacy center on north main street that'd be great and then the amazing Jim carbon rights then\nForgot to mention the weather beast yesterday was the lightning that set fire to a Wakefield church steeple and burned it down I didn't see video of that but the Boston Globe has a picture that\nWow wow [noise] um [noise] something wrong with the lightning bolt of lightning bolts lightning rod\nOn that steeple while you don't\nSee that very much a anymore a passenger of an unnamed\nChinese airline got pretty upset after learning that his flight was canceled the night before so much so that he was caught on cameras smacking an airline employee at the kiosk in the face with his iPhone according to the local news the flight was cancelled\nDue to weather conditions which seems like a pretty standard reason for a flight cancellation\nBut the man named will not to be confused with ... ... well\nThat would be clearly Howard a completely different a reference of the word\nWill or the man named ... wasn't having it he assaulted the employee after being told that all the flights the next day we're already booked will was blacklisted by the airline and given a five day detention\nCheckout footage of the incident to the ... or wait this is radio so you can click on your radio and ... and see it but\nWow wow yup yup\nAirlines at fault and because the amazing\nYup the airlines at fault\nAnd because the amazing Jim courtroom wasn't available um he couldn't smack Jim carbon in the face with his iPhone so we had to settle a for the poor airline employee behind the kiosk and again we mentioned that Jim core been not only reports on the weather\nYou also creates it that's why they're so accurate but not not all over the world the world just just here in this area\nUm\nYou have to consult a completely different meteorologist to find

P. D. the blue streak um of all the stupid things I did the one thing\nThe one thing from my youth I really kind of proud of is I never ever ever ever ever not once ever smashed somebody else's pumpkin\nMy mom would let us smash our pumpkin after Halloween if they survive but I was like five or six years old\nI think our first year in West Berlin our pumpkin got smashed and that was bummed out as a little kid and I didn't want to do that to some other little kid\n\nOh sorry I Am not a metal head writes agent five or six I'm not a metal head but how about the O's rainbow in the dark\nI said me dead hoops confusing in with Mike civic of all of the family thing metal head I Am in fact a meat had writes agent five or six well there's some self awareness I Would never call you that but you do have the right to say that to yourself but anyway of all the ...\n... I Would never call you that but you do have the right to say that yourself but any way of all the ... and things I did as a kid and they weren't a lot of it was a pretty good kid that was incredibly happy kid\nUm I never smashed anyone else's pet a pumpkin not once every two boys from Lawrence, Kansas\nWould like to have a word with the man who they caught on camera smashing the pumpkins on their porch one evening was he also trying to steal a packages from Amazon\nThe dad Chris lies ... posted a video of the incident on Facebook urging people to let the jerk no that his boys to have a few words to say in the video the man can be seen smashing pumpkin after pumpkin onto their walkway making a huge mess\nI'm a gallon the old days on the Frank fully shall we say let's go to the feel good file that the thin one [noise] an Arizona boy had anything but a happy birthday when none none of us thirty two guests showed up to it\nWhen none none of us thirty two guests showed up to his pizza party this weekend gay couple of things I'm One\nOf 'em um\nIf you're not going to go to some kids party tell someone RSVP email back phone call I don't know I don't know a number two um parents if you know if you know your kid doesn't have a lot of friends\nIf you know that unfortunately your kid is the one that other kids don't want to play with at school for whatever reason\nUm don't set 'em up for further humiliation by inviting thirty two kids who you desperately hope will show up but in your heart of hearts no probably won't show up\nKids are so over scheduled nowadays\nWith all 'cause kids could have no free time if your kid has any free time at all you were lousy parent they want us to believe um kids are so over shows rolled 'em [noise]\nParents are begging begging for a reason not to bring their rotten little Crump crush or to somebody else's rotten little crumbs crushing birthday party so think twice about that but but anyway there was a happy ending here\nSo the kid invites thirty two people to his birthday pizza party no one shows up not one person\n[noise]\nThe way I think the same thing happened to Nancy Pelosi's last birthday party as well\nNo one showed up at her party either and she's still still didn't get the message thank you for your service tied to move along now great work great work great work Nancy but the Democrats need to connect a little bit more with the little guy now and a little bit less with the huge donors\nThought that'd be clear to you after you\nThe huge donors thought that'd be clear to you after you record since what Brock Obama was elected in two thousand and eight\nNancy your your your record of success versus failure is about three successes versus eight hundred and Seventy two failures\nBack to our sporting theme if she was a college football coach he would have been fired by now but whoops nope but anyhow any [noise] so the bottom line is this poor kid nobody showed up to his party just like nobody showed up to Nancy's but anyway\nUm the boys mom still misogyny shared on social media that dozens of kids were expected that the pizza party for her son teddy but nobody showed up nobody\nUh she shared a\nPicture of her sad son at a table with pizzas and a bunch of Empty Plates but it seems teddy may have the last laugh\nAfter the news went viral several people send birthday wishes to the boy\nAnd the Phoenix sons of the NBA invited him to tonight's game against the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James what's more professional soccer club the Phoenix rising also invited him to their playoff\nGame friday night in an unrelated matter\nUh when I become benevolence are [noise] are no more of these teams nicknames for sports teams I'm a ... the name that donated yes I mean with the exception of the red Sox and the White Sox will grandfather them in but you know\nFire St Louis pride or the team that I was the voice of for two years in the continental indoor football league the New England surge\nFor two years in the continental indoor football league the New England surge yet no more of that no more that let's get back to the wolves coyotes\nUm\nBanana slugs what's the school out in California that's the banana slugs I don't know but anyway Phoenix rising yeah that's nice but that's that's come on place\nAnyway five away to two to one three to zero five a way to to to Thirteen twenty so nobody nobody showed up at the kids' party\n[noise] but now now a professional athletes have stepped up to try to make the kid happy today to make his dreams come true Mm five oh wait two to one three

it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine before\nWho waging twenty seven wants to hear that Barbara Streisand version of somewhere over the rainbow I didn't know Barbra Streisand had had a version of that song\nI'm not a huge Barbra Streisand fan and I think it's my father's fault is my father's fault them he my father was wonderful but he was was of that era of males wear unless unless a woman was dropped dead\nOf males wear unless unless a woman was drop dead gorgeous there was no sense anyone paying attention to her it's amazing and my father was a good man good father good husband a but it's amazing back in the old days when women were ... were considered property and not people\nHow so many women looked at them that way so because Barbara Streisand wasn't drop dead gorgeous um oh God the terrible things used to say about her\nI've seen better a hat on beer I've seen better heads a lettuce\nBigger knows the Jimmy Durante he was vicious vicious so even though I respect Barbra Streisand's talent was never a huge fan of hers or she is a bit of a nut but boy can she act not just a great singer\nI mean nobody's more impressed with Barbara Streisand singing then let me think Barbara Streisand [noise] um so she's a off the charts diva she's the kind of woman that makes Mariah Carey seem\nA subtle and humble um boy she impressed with yourself but she can really saying and all those rare occasions when she acts a prince of tides I'm\n\nStar is born all of that anyway we're not here to talk about Barbra Streisand I'll bet you want to hear the Barbra Streisand

city hall at seven o'clock I'm question if they are doing it oh this is do you approve of a portion of old parking lot um\n\nOh God oh my God and then some more ridiculous anti anti Elizabeth Warren stuff again which again you know any other am station\nBecause yes having 'em one party the Democrats control eighty six percent of the legislature in Massachusetts I think that's a bit of a problem\nNow some of that is because the Republicans have run so many awful candidates are that have allowed a lot of well awful democratic candidates to win but again I I'm not glad I'm not proud that our legislature has\nEighty six percent Democrats I Would like to see more balance but that's how I felt the first six to eight years of my life\nNow now now\nThe way the Republicans have behaved since the Ronald Reagan administration I mean it used to be dog whistles that used to be subtle racism now it's outright I'm used to be subtly subtly robbing from the poor in the middle class to give to the rich now it's overt overt reverse Robin Hood\nTake from the poor the working class and give to the rich\nNow now wow wow\nWhole life all sixty years in Massachusetts a Republican gave me a reason to vote for him I vote for and we need more balanced in the state house not now now now you got to our next year name now count me\nHouse not now now now you got to our next year name now count me out count me out wow\nI mean I Love Julie hall Charlie Baker they're reasonable Republicans the way Republicans used to be but you want to be part of that group you still want to be part of that

texture what specifically would you as a city council would do\nTo improve the city's reputation as business friendly or welcoming that's a good question that's a good question and one thing I've noticed and again I've been coming out of the world since the early nineties\nUm so many areas of the city have grown and expanded and a look and feel and are so much better than they were in the early nineties or with the exception of the heart of downtown\nLike a time capsule it looks exactly the same same empty buildings same empty lots what would you do to fill those that's going to be a question or the other one\n\nLet's say a new high school is being planned marijuana is legal what else is there to ask plastic bags\nYeah I Hope I I I that's an important issue I Hope we come up with that are you saying Julie is an awful candidate no I Love Julie hall Julie hall is a great candidate\nJulie halls one of my favorite paid Pete up people in the city one of my favorite people in this city I think Julie hall is wonderful I'm unlike so so many I think very poorly is great\nI think Julie hall is wonderful I'm unlike so so many I think Betty Ford is great and I think both of them like

Tuesday's debate to the Georgia secretary of state gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp accused Stacey Abrams says encouraging undocumented people to vote illegally Abrams responded campus use Georgia strict exact match voter id law to put thousands voter applications on hold\nUnder secretary camp\nMore people have lost the right to vote in the state of Georgia they've been purged they've been suppressed and they've been scared\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voter suppression feeds the narrative because voters oppression isn't only about blocking the vote is also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nSo you saw the debate last night professor or a girl can you talk about on ... was raised and start with this issue of voter suppression the accusation that Brian Kemp is holding on to fifty three thousand voter registration forms and also that leaked audio recording\nThe three thousand voter registration forms and also that leaked audio recording questioning Georgians right to vote\n\nI Stacey Abrams versus Brian camp\nHas become a touchdown for the entire country and for for issues of voter rights\nAnd thinking about what does voting mean who has the right to vote a voter suppression\nA questions of you know alleged questions of voter fraud\nAnd we saw that play out on the debate or on the debate stage last night where you know you had Brian Kemp saying voters the idea of voters depression is a farce versus stay safe Abrams were clearly and explicitly said no actually voting is a voting as a write it as a constitutional right as a protected right\nAnd this election is all about ensuring the rights of people to ensure a that democracy is actually a a at exists as opposed to just imagine so really that's what you know and that's that was at the heart of the debate last night\nUm and really played out I'm as these as these two contenders to very polarizing and very opposite ah opinions on a very contentious issue\nA professor earlier right regardless of trash you about the the Rolling Stone relieve some of the audio all book Kemp talking to some donors about who's concerned about too many people voting\nAbsolutely I mean I'm this is not actually a new concern are the Republicans for a very long time um have had very open conversations and other cases a very private conversations about they're concerned about turnout\nAnd why is that because the higher the turnout particularly amongst groups of color are particularly amongst young people tends to favor democratic candidates\nIn this case Stacey Abrams has really taken you know what what should be a novel per se what isn't\nThis case Stacey Abrams has really taken you know what what should it be a novel ... what is a novel approach like going out and pounding the pavement and going after a non likely unlikely voters voters who haven't voted before young people people of color getting them to try and turn out I'm at high numbers and so if you're Brian Kemp\nThat is something that you absolutely don't want and so in his you know in his private remarks\nThis is essentially what he said which is we don't want these people coming out and voting we we you know we have to think about what are the alternatives are and how can we not get them to come out even though that's their legal and constitutional right\nTo where we're going to go to break and come back this discussion will also bring in Greg palace Jewish suing the secretary of state camp\nI'm Leah Wright rigor is going to stay with us professor at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard University will also be asking her about the video that's just come out\nOf Stacey Abrams decades ago participating in a flag burning of the Confederate flag of Georgia at the time that led to the flag being replaced gotten rid of that says democracy now stay with us [noise]\n\n... natural ... that says democracy now I'm Amy Goodman with finding solace\nAs we continue to look at voter suppression in Georgia a new investigation has found that the Georgia secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp\nHas overseen the removal of more than three hundred and forty thousand current Georgia residents from voting rolls in a moment we will be joined by journalist Greg palace but first I Want to turn to part of a new video he produced\nAbout the voter purge in Georgia\nHow the chemical wipe out the registrations of five hundred fifty thousand voters he used the postcard trick camp sent out millions of these cards requiring voters to confirm\nTheir addresses problem they looked like junk mail eight out of ten voters you get them throw them away throw away the card and can can throw you off the rolls the trick not everyone gets a postcard mostly they go to neighborhoods like this\nThis is my neighborhood and this is where I almost got birds\nStacey Hopkins is a community organizer\nYou give me a baby is also a community that's rapidly changing impacts us as a voting community with all these empty houses are voters being lost our political powers\nWith all these empty houses are voters being lost our political power is being lost\nWhen camps and her postcard he picked the wrong target\nI look at these malice other telling me and two of my children that if we did not fill out the forms and returned them we were going to be moved to the inactive list but we're just voted by decided to\nTry and hold a Mr Kemp accountable for that because I wanted to know why you didn't want me to vote we filed suit against secretary of state county\nAnd she won big time\nA hundred and fifty nine thousand or restore to the voting rolls and that was that was a good feeling\nBut would feel bad is that more than half a million voters remain on the ... we had to threaten camp with a federal lawsuit but he finally gave up the names of every voter he perched then we need all the names public I was flooded with Nineteen hundred emails from Georgians stunned they had lost the right to vote\nInvestigative journalist Greg palace attempted to question Georgia secretary of state the Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp about the purge\nRemoving black voter rolls electric wires you like what do we get the voters who've been removed\nMe right now is there any other reporter being thrown out is are you specifically\nSo That's Greg palace questioning the Republican candidate for governor Brian can push the secretary of state grant Palestine journalist has been investigating camp and voter suppression in Georgia director of the ... sixteen documentary titled the best democracy money can buy\nYou are suing Brian camp as well Greg palace to explain what you found and why you're showing him\nWell you're the wouldn't answer my questions\nExplain what you found out and why are showing him\nWell you're the one answer my questions so he's going to have to answer them in federal court there's a follow up to my Rolling Stone to thousands sixteen\nInvestigation uh we're suing him and I say we including a civil rights organization to find out why he's remove three hundred and forty thousand one hundred and thirty four and Georgians on suppose it evidence that they've left the state\nOr left their county and they are in there are still in their home registration address if they haven't left to talk to a third of a million people\nIf these people show up to vote a on a November six they're going to find that they canceled they'll be handed a provisional ballot but it won't be counted this is huge and the these lists are violently\nRacially prejudiced so we're going into court to get all the answers why did this we know what's wrong and from my other investigations I was able to get inside his uh his operation and get the some of the purge list before\nIt's quite an ugly operation I've never seen a purge operation this why this big and this one thing that Stacey Abrams was mentioning during the debate it's not just the fifty three thousand names pending it's the three hundred and forty thousand people heard that is their registration have been canceled\nThat's why we're in court with the voting rights groups and to get the information on exactly why these people were wrongly removed\nAnd grab you are a veteran of visit this issue voter suppression and various on a national elections I think back to\nKatherine Harris and drive off Florida during the infamous off of Florida recount vote and the Persian Gulf ... suppose felons from other Florida voting list Kenneth Blackwell another Republican secretary of state in Ohio during the two thousand four elections we've heard about Kris Kobach\nPublic and secretary of state in Ohio during the two thousand four elections we've heard about Chris called back in Kansas and now camp in Georgia this this secretary of state position rarely gets a lot of attention but when it comes to election time it's a key positions and that well\nThat's one thing that's not very well understood it's very very dangerous for Brian Kemp to be in charge of the vote while he's running for governor as you said for example Kris Kobach also secretary of state and got another story coming up is closing up and moving polling stations where voters of color can't get those stations\nCamp is doing the same thing by the way he's closed stations or if I'm In neighborhoods the voters of color in Atlanta for example in the six Georgia congressional district he he will be the one when people go to the polling stations and find they'd been purged\nSo in a way this is drawing back on that twenty sixteen uh twenty sixteen strategy which was quite effective for him which is a rallying cry to all of these people around the country this base that put him in office that elected him at a time when in the midterms are in the midterms\nIn an office that elected him at a time when in the midterms are in the midterms where he is really pushing a a culture war strategy and reviving a culture war strategy because there's not much else to go on so it's worked for him in the past\nHe's a it's a calling card and serious reviving it or the other interesting point is that he's reviving it at a moment where Steve Bannon is no longer officially a associated with his uh with the White House with the Trump Administration\nSo it does tell you that that you know those ties are still there but so is that ideology that's pulling through um it's a message again to the base that I'm here for you I stand for you I support your agenda it's also a warning\nFor those outside in a way of alienating other people as outsiders and uh it's Donald Trump's way of saying I'm president of these people but not those people\nAnd that's all kinds of ... says the Florida gubernatorial candidate the Democrat Andrew Gillum was targeted by a racist robocall paid for by a white supremacist group Galen aiming to beat Florida's first black governor and this is a clip of the ... a real warning it it's extremely gracious\n[noise]\nAnd this is the gubernatorial candidate Tallahassee\nMayor Andrew Gillum responding to these racist robocalls on CNN\nI Want to make sure that we don't racialized and frankly weaponize race as a part of this process which is why I called on my opponents to really work to rub of some of these things I'm a ... people are taking their cues from him\nFrom his campaign in from Donald Trump and we and we saw in Charlottesville but that could lead to real frankly dangerous outcome\nLayer right regarding your final comments on the climate right now\nWell these are races that are indicative of a much broader\nWell these are races that are indicative\nOf a much broader and ah I'm In some ways much more dangerous climate um that really ties back to a\nReally ties back to the Trump Administration and the emergence of you know a really the emergence of a much broader identity that is tied to nationalism racialized nationalism but the other thing that's going on here is that we have a set of candidates\nThat I'm a running against people that have wholly type themselves to Donald Trump proudly tied themselves to Donald Trump and Donald Trump's agenda so really what we're gearing up for it is a showdown\nBetween you know does the Trump effect still stand this a one way of approaching politics\nOr this exclusionary way of ... a ... approaching a national politics and local and state politics or is there another way is there is there a way that is built on alliances and coalitions\nThat is inclusive and his about expanding the boundaries of democracy so that all American citizens count\nWe want to thank you for being with us a lay right we're gr professor at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard University she's the author of the loneliness of the black Republican pragmatic politics and the pursuit of power grid\nPalace journalist she's been investigating a Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who's running for governor and the Republican ticket than looking overall at voter suppression in Georgia\nThis is democracy now when we come back on what's happening in dodge that to dodge Kansas and how a A R U S corporations profiting from ice stay with us [noise]\n\nMm [noise]\nShoes or\n...\n\nThe flowers in Guatemala from the soundtrack to finding Oscar the democracy now I'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzales\nWell in terms of local officials are under fire for moving majority Latino cities single polling site outside the city limits\nMore than a mile from the nearest bus stop dodge city Kansas is nearly sixty percent Hispanic but the Associated Press reports that Hispanic turnout in the county were dodge city is located which the Seventeen percent compared to sixty one percent turnout for white voters in two thousand fourteen\nThey feel your reports dodges loan polling site service has more than Thirteen thousand voters compared to an average of twelve hundred voters for polling site and other locations we're joined now by Johnny Depp lap would they Kansas Democratic Party he's joining us from dodge city welcome to democracy now tell us what happened\nWell ah so this is really\nDemocracy now tell us what happened well\nAh so this is really a one more ah a saying in a larger longer problem uh a way back in two thousand two or the ... the county clerk went down to just one polling place for a City Kansas [noise] um and\nIt's been that way since and that one polling place was in the more affluent white part of town I'm Don city is pretty clearly divided between like a all white and no more than part of town on the on the Hispanic southern part of town [noise] um\nSo this move or the polling location\nIs is really just taking a fall ready bad situation and making it worse because\nAh it's moved the polling location outside of town a sort of convenient for no one um\nAnd when you compare when you combine that with a historic turn out of Seventeen percent for the un has a Hispanic population has sixty one percent turnout for the white population a and then you look at uh our elected officials ah every seat we have except for the kind of conditions that large so our city commission our\nA school board or our community college board of trustees uh every one of those officers are currently held by a white person even though the town is sixty percent Hispanic so the this move is is just like I said it's just\nOne more um one more thing in a in an ongoing a problem\nAnd I ... I'd like to ask you because most people are not aware that replace a comic place like dodge city of fame than the and the west would movement of Americans uh is uh is has such a high ... Latino population but it's not the only place in the mid west throughout Iowa and ...\nPopulation but it's not the only place in the Midwest throughout a Iowa and Kansas and Nebraska a there's been a huge surge in the last Twenty years or so of Latino population is mostly as a result of\nThe importation of Mexican labor for the meatpacking industry could you talk about that\nI'm not sure uh so in in ... specifically a that influx began in the late seventies early Nineteen eighties um there are now um\nTo a large be packing plants in a down city it's it's one of the cornerstones of our economy around here and uh those be packing plants have historically recruited folks from\nA um a points south to ah to come here and live and work and civil we have now is a second third generation Americans who have only ever voted one polling place and don't know that it could be better\nAnd what's what's the reason the city clerk gifts for ... the law and policy but forget about the fact that it's already over burden given the uh the voting population but they're moving it outside of the city limits to a place where you can't even get there by public transportation\nWell so uh it's it's a county clerk the county clerk I'm I met with her in may I'm I'm a late may\nOr to them or you know ask her to increase the number of polling places and this is not the first time I've met with uh our county clerk\nI'm an ... and her predecessor in several times in an effort to convince them to have more going places and the excuses as she gives for only having one polling place frankly don't hold water I mean one of them as she said well it's\nA the it would increase costs to have more polling places and it's just not in my budget well\nThe thing is she writes her own budget um so if something is not in our budget is because she didn't put it in her budget\nBudget um so if something is not in our budget is because she didn't put it in her budget um and you know and then she complains about the number of a voting machines that she has and um the thing is she has enough machines to cover a the polling place a\nWith a Thirteen thousand voter bird and um you could take some of those machines and split them out to\nOther sites and he would still have enough voting machines\nUm we have to be able to have more accountability from these corporations we need to be able to ensure that they respect him basic human rights and and if the government isn't willing to step up to do it we know that workers inside or going to be able to organize and also the general public is able to push back on that I see what we know that more and more corporations are starting to influence international ...\nGonzales welcome thank you very much for being with us with the group the day that does it for today's broadcast I'll be speaking tonight and at least in the hall in orange County California\nSeveral university check out what I find myself was speaking at Rutgers on friday\nLopez from there I mean he goes\nAnd I would find his house\n...

meant oh we'll need right and how that transformed Sarah real\nInteresting issue right now\nA lot going on with national grid over the you know the divest to church street lights to back to the town yeah he'll be an interesting conversation\nWell and I think to one of the things before we get into that I wanted to talk about his we've been following the story and we've had the students on\nA talking about their push to get Brown University to divest if something in their investments in particular a fossil fuel companies yeah I remember aside and not to react to that what's your reaction it's\nKind of an interesting decision I think from for ground to make you know brown\nIs is a tends to be ... as far as I remember going to do some go Elise out in front of these issues and more progressive uh had a new president there and I knew president yeah um [noise]\nYou know I think that there may have been concerned that there were some members of the board that were kind of singled out his having relationships with the industry the fossil fuel industry based on their address for businesses and\nA and I'm sure that that was\nHer carry us and they also are\nOr were concerned about\nWater or what presidential value this might have in terms of all kinds of interest coming to them and say do this do that with their management portfolio\n... that must have been a very hard decision for them to make and uh\nThat's a rather it must have been a very hard decision for them to make them\nBecause they're going to fall out yeah right Jeff how 'bout you\nEat the oil or ... or ... doesn't have any interest in in the ... on either side of the divest or it's just that we would only be my personal opinion which is that um you know the each organization has to make their own decisions and and\nI was surprised by brown decision so um well it's true balancing act sets the Juno where the business side of green we look at every aspect of the financial and economic\nDecisions and how they manifest themselves in terms of policy changes and new innovations um changes in administration or culture\nOr business changes what drives it and so from that point of view certainly as you said there's there's a lot of reasons why if you're up your financial person looking at investments\nThat you have that prism and you're not so much not not that there's not a sustainable investing but\nYou know your prism is is very much on trying to return on investment and to make sure that you know if you do that that doesn't fall back on students with higher fees and things like that Brown's got a healthy budget they spend a lot of\nMoney right they they clearly have sort of significant operating expenses that they deal with here in Providence\nAlert Calvert so the world show how how important a tool investment can be in terms of driving social policy absolute like to see\nThe university's embracing math but they're also caught up in there are really making sure that they manage returns and their their you know the president's\nPosition was ... war we're not going to do this with our restroom portfolio\nYou know ... well we're not going to do this with our restroom portfolio we are working hard on a bringing the innovations to industry or to help move this issue forward and we need to keep focusing on the educational sign and where we can do in terms of innovation to help with the situation\nAnd they have a great sustainability director of the program is so comprehensive right now he's management to retrofitting of buildings to energy use all of it too you know all those up there but it's\nThis challenge and the in the um\nThe money management sector where you know the future you know it's it's the same kind of thing we talk about a lot where there you're you may have to take it now to bring better economics in the future\nAnd the question fundamentally is pure investing in sustainable way whether that can be sustained is a good investment firm yeah yeah and that's a big question mark\nBut I like and we've had Calvert on many times and I like their approach in that\nThey're trying to work with any and all companies to make them better\nSo a fossil fuel company [noise]\nThey're not all painted with the same brush\nYou know some have different policies as it relates to boil versus natural gas fracking versus conventional means or their own investment in clean energy so\nThey're always trying to take companies you know clearly aren't going to totally meet their criteria and make them better use the power of their dollars in their investment in so [noise]\nYou know I'm not a total purists I think we all got to come to the table and we all have to get better and it's a collective effort and here I don't think we should showing 'em but clearly a brown\nFat to size endowment these type types of investments they do have a lot\nNow amid these type types of investments they do have a lot of clout ...\nSo that has been particularly interesting to us we've been following in Juneau and reporting on the collapse colony collapse and the issues surrounding that whether that's purely a chemical on and be colonies absolutely um and then there was a sewer water which column and you're\nAnd we have followed along in their steps and then we went a step farther fish was all last year this was all in the last two years two years ago\nAnd so last year we wrote um including ... wrote the what's called the missile streetlights investment act which is a little piece of legislation which allowed towns to buy the lights from the utility\nAnd then manage them locally where you are a smart guy so bored Peter [laughter]\nThat's because he's a brilliant to not smart for governor [laughter] it's like the right idea er nurse or\n[laughter] that's a great idea or national grid serve food not include Eli the light and is there is an actual narrow\nAllowed you know and it does go back to when I was a kid I remember when lights were sort of bluish and then they started to bring in these yellow lights that I remember my father who was an insurance agent saying well they are better they use less energy\nBut the latest model traumatic it's yellow it fire trucks look black in it but estranged don't show up so there's a lot of improvement that can be done in the lighting of our streets the new Eli the lights are they use a fifth the electricity they last five to ten times as long so there's less maintenance\nPlus everything is in true color fire trucks of red municipal public safety vehicles pop\nOr you can see pedestrians parked cars bicycles much better under those less a light pollution right doesn't simulate and there's less ... yet focused yeah\nThere there's an interesting new a new phenomenon and street lights lighting and that is that the ... to light besides the streets and not the streets themselves because of sites or wherever pedestrians are more interference\nThere in in a vehicle lighting the headlights on our cars as far better than it was Twenty years ago we can see farther ahead\nWe don't need the roadway lit up so the new technology lights the sides of the roads where this disabled vehicles and ... and and congestion it also then you light the intersections\nThan with Eli delights you can buy lights which have varied directed light much much less stray light I'm I'm not going to get to technical on it and you shouldn't but Adam brought us level\nPay a light with which is a sodium light produces more lumens more light energy than a comparable Eli daylight but less\nLumens more light energy than a comparable Eli daylight but less where it's directed at the ground where you need it so bottom line where improving safety visibility for drivers were saving money right that's all wrapped up saving money and saving\nEnergy yeah and in the less energy from fossil fuels as his better for all of us\nNational grid has this terror for native Starbucks says rates by different technologies different kinds of street light fixtures is that right but it didn't contemplate we'd be writing which is the new wave and street right\nThat's correct it included very old incandescent technology the intermediate murky vapor and then the most common one now which is the high pressure sodium yellow light\nAnd they set a charge based on it's not metered just set a charge based on what those technologies will use for energy and a year where than to support it and then they just charge the cities that\nThat's a great question to the ... in our houses in our businesses we have electric meters and that measures how many kilowatt hours we use of electricity we can build fourth\nStreet like do not have meters because they're spread all over the place so the streetlights they the the terrorists says there is X number of hours four thousand one hundred Seventy five hours of darkness in Rhode Island um that would very if you were in Florida or South America or Canada\nAnd it it that if you ladies on from dusk to dawn it uses a certain number of kilowatt hours per year and that's what you build for well if you use a light that's more efficient use less kilowatt hours in the same number of\nHours sort of the town had switched to the lighting under the current stress or a structure they would've used a lot less energy but they wouldn't have gotten any benefit from it because they still would have been charged for one of the traditional fixed they would have been charge the same\nAmount of money they wouldn't have gotten economic benefits will still be an energy benefits right because\nThe same amount of money they wouldn't have gotten economic benefits will still would be an energy benefits right because it would be less fossil fuels and and and so our coastal communities that are concerned about sea level rise\nThat still would have been there but what would have happened was the utility would have had a higher profits and around a lot of profit built into street lights you know based on those rates are set for work so is this unique do you think\nTo Rhode Island or would other 'cause obviously our listeners are everywhere all over the world of all over New England would this be applicable in in in a lot of other cities and towns do you think\nPeter on the answer that the the the question is absolutely yes it has been done in some towns in terms of in in in terms of buying their street lights\nWhere we went farther in the u._s. or outside the in the U.S okay and outside the U. S. so great and what what is what is really important in Rhode Island is that are terrified new tariffs\nAllows a controls of the lights and all those things I'm Sorry the statutes which is supposed to be implemented by the new tariffs and is is is not yet\nDone by the tariffs allows solid state controls the lighting this allows\nPhenomenal what it allows it allows the lights to be damned at night you need more light at dusk to dawn but in the middle of the night you don't need as much and the actual amount of light that you use depends on the business of the area [noise]\nThey can also in some areas in rural parts can be turned off for a few hours in the middle of the night but the part that gets exciting for local officials is maybe there's a theater getting out\nYou can brightened the lights just for an hour Kuala theaters getting out that's fantastic if there is a public safety emergency maybe an evacuation hurricanes the next Sandy that you mentioned earlier said well that's coming you can set the lights directly from a police car or from the public\nAnd earlier so that's coming you can set the lights directly from a police car or from the public works department and this is where a local control becomes so important\nTo flash sequence surely can highlight the exit routes for people to take so just follow the flashing lights axons drive right out of it is a crime report it or there's an automobile accident from the police car they can brighten the lights on that block\nSo that these controls are huge way beyond just the energy savings and the monetary savings that it allows a whole new technology to come in that\nThat nobody knows about in Rhode Island is the lead we're the only statute in the country that allows this kind of controls or or requires this kind of control to be to be allowed and your organization and and then said you're jumping and you yourself\nYou advocated for this on behalf of those cities and towns in Washington County is that correct you got them to agree\nThat that this um\nChange would be a good thing and you went ahead and helped ... got to be honest Peter this came about on a cost issue to save the town's money on the maintenance side [noise]\nWe were wrecked recommended to put the controls in and I thought it was just ... [noise]\nAs I researched it after the legislation ... while the legislation was being considered by the Rhode Island general assembly I began to realize\nThe enormous possibilities on a public safety side but that wasn't the original driving force it may end up being the most important thing we do but it wasn't what started it is is to Washington County\nOr whatever and it's a state statutes and actually the cities and towns is very much involved in the terror proceeding that's going on right on our our we can benefit managers hockey or yeah okay so let's talk about the economic sure since ... was the main thing that was driving or what are the economics big protests\nEconomics or some throat was the main thing that was driving or what are the economics big picture in terms of\nIf we talk statewide and rather than I mean I I'm going to jump back and forth between Washington County and state wide because some figures I have local and some fingers I have statewide\nThe towns um spend about Fifteen million dollars a year on street lights statewide were small state there's many cities in the country that spend more than that on street lighting\nBut but across our state it's about Fifteen million dollars in his state that's a pretty big number on it and not at all it's a lot and if in the amount of kilowatt hours you use for that is ridiculously small compared to what the cost is the ... that that pays for the power for the lights\nIt pays for the electrical distribution of that electricity and it also pays for the maintenance of the lights changing the bulbs I'm adding a new ball here adding a new light there as new residential division subdivisions come in and ... going down\nSorry of coal going down yes if there's an accident in a poll gets locked down it pays for replacing the texture as it needs to be done and just upgrading as they go\nSo far it has not allowed upgrading to the new technology abilities but that's part of this what this picture brings 'em but the economics are pretty astounding when you bring in the concept of local maintenance\nPreviously and my grandfather's age and he worked for the electric company um was bigger was better the local utility which was a locally owned company had had\nAnd I'm I'm going to editorialize here but they had in some ways the best interest of the communities at heart I think that's not the case anymore with these multinational shareholder owned utilities um in in ... handling very local issues it becomes ponder is and it becomes overly expensive [laughter]\nThe local issues it becomes ponder is and it becomes overly expensive\nSo we're back on her new album out on er here which are brought here from Washington carry part burning council um so what tell us about the turf ... proceeding that's going on right now you see what are some areas of uh of debate there\nAnd it's a long list that than the uh but the there's only a few that are really key\nLong list than the uh but the there's only a few that are really key\nUm [noise] the\nWithin the terror of the tariffs sets the rates that said how much you pay per kilowatt but it also sets lots of the conditions under which the work gets done because our drive is to save town save money just for the system and that that's usually for the ... who are the customers is we're looking at\nWhere are there in the proposed tariffs are the costs which have to be born by the ... that are not necessary\nSo that's our first take what what has to be done we absolutely support anything which is important for safety which is important for efficient operations but when those extra costs\nAnd I'll give you an example is that we have spoken in the development of this with a company which provides more than three hundred municipalities with their street like maintenance services\nSo I think you can say they're experts they do this across the country\nAnd on the one issue of twin does a national grid crew or utility crews have to come out when our private contractor is going to do work on the lights\nThey can take what might be a hundred dollar service call with our bucket truck in person and transform it into a three hundred dollar service call where the utility crew has to come out the energize the light we come out work on it then they come back and energize the life\nThis is a service which across the country and internationally street lights are often most often worked on life electricians know what they're doing they know how to do it without turning the power off\nAnd in most cases nowadays they're installing a few structure which allows them to be turned off as you do the normal maintenance this makes it a much more efficient process in the future or in the proposal lets before us on the rate is that we would have to have those two visits by National Guard\nProposal lets before us on the rate is that we would have to have those two visits by national grid grill at the same time that are persons coming out there\nWhich simply drives the cost up more than it needs to be with no real increase in safety and so we're we're working on many many issues like that that may be the biggest one and all of that will take car long and uh and and when will we see the program spot to\nRoll out through requires a juicy required Marshall group to develop her for court career in Vancouver B. C. sixty days to approve bitter\nAs it turns out it's going to take the view the longer than six to ... to deal with the issues that are in front of him [noise]\nSo we're we're expecting a hearing public hearing in early December at this point in a decision\nFor first week of December so\nThis is a two thousand and fourteen roll out [noise]\nYou know the focus All right now so what we don't want to lose sight of before we switch gears and talk about some of the other excellent work that Jeff and his team do that Washington County planning and how that relates to planning going on all over the world right for cities and towns that's something we're\nKeenly interested in the ... particularly the economics behind it\nBut what we should not lose sight of is clearly there is a environmental benefits right that we are going to reduce emissions\nBecause of the efficiency of those balls so there's almost a carbon credit that could be right right uh captured out of out of the work that just doing their\nUm the other thing is that the um the the question I have two questions really Jeff is already kind of alluded to the fact that potentially we're going to save some money on maintenance going forward but the thing that's interesting to me is ten\nA maintenance going forward but the thing that's interesting to me is ten poll\nStart to do things more than just have a street light and kept you know carry wires like does it become more multi dimensional because we've been talking about that as we've been looking at electrification and car charging stations and where do you put them and\nHow do you deliver energy and then the other thing is that is of interest to me is could you ever power this with solar\nYear I mean there are so many technologies that are involving rapidly more rapidly than utility has been ready to incorporate a vote with regard to\nNew energy a supply forestry rights but also from a breeder and fired or providing actual real time metering so that you don't have to be arbitrary and the way that you're building before I've\nBeen sort of the municipalities going to have a lot more impact on the control sigh of issues with Jeff was talking about so that's a real potential\nTransformative element\nThere is a company in Massachusetts making solar street lights\nAnd a wide open with the president of the company\nYou know what you mean as I Do I Can't remember it at the moment but when you you know what we'll do is like a normal now and certainly that will be of interest his name as many or I Can't remember his last name and it's a terrific guy because he also because a solar lights have to be very carefully controlled they use less electricity\nBut one of the reasons that that would not be widespread\nIs it's it's great where you have a poll that's all you need a light at a rural intersection where the electricity isn't there\nBut they're still not cost effective compare even they're not even close to cost effective where there is great electricity right to the system and it's not the panels itself it's the batteries that have to make this thing run all night\nNot the panels itself it's the batteries that have to make this thing run all night or in and therefore it's it's it's it's very useful in certain circumstances but not at all circumstance okay I heard\nThe technologies are evolving ... groups are very ... will come a center of the main point is getting ready for change and that's where the loan will be enrolled flexible or\nAnd this is what I wanted to get to is that for for we leave street by some talk more generally about Washington kind of regional council for this is indicative of what's happening in a lot of different areas of the water where they want us pretty throughout a little bit Jeff speak\nA little in in in [noise]\nI think we've moved to where we're realizing that smart local control with the current technologies in the emerging technologies just of communication and the Internet allows things that we didn't dream of long ago that controls I talked about just on street lights\nThose are all on top of every street light there's a photo cell which turns it on when it gets dark out and turns it off again that's the limit of what's in the current streetlight system\nThe new controls you'd pick that photo sell up you put this little box on it then you put the photo sell on top of the box\nThat any body that's almost like a mini computer that you're adding middle that little box includes a computer includes communication\nIt draws its electricity minor from the light\nAnd that allows the light to be controlled from a computer over why\nI'm at a distance fit a lower directly as you said in a car or a leader are into it that is correct credible it also allows the other uses say a camera to be mounted on there a surveillance camera on camera an accident camera inspection camera\nUm it also allows a public why station to be attached to it so if a municipality or the state of Rhode Island decided to\nPut publicly owned\nA ... or the state of Rhode Island decided to put publicly owned\nA Internet connections around that can as many things that could come off of that hung on the pole without a significant increase in weight but remember the town's don't in world owned the polls that's part of the electric distribution system for you know we call them telephone poles their own many of them are owned by the telephone company\nCan't their primary uses not street lighting their primary used as getting electricity and getting communications out to all of our buildings\nFor Peter I've just read a book called the third industrial revolution by a man named Jeremy Roose river can and a\nAnd this seems so illustrative of what he says in the book which is that you know in the second\nSecond industrial revolution there was this drive towards vertical a\n... vertical or our excuse me\nA vertical a central location of power infrastructure basically so that we have\nThese power plants that were servicing you know from a central location servicing are all of our energy needs and they were taking in power and not only in ... in the energy term but in power over people effectively by the town's basically submitting to the\nPower company to to manage their streetlight assets because they didn't want the headache\nAnd now what we're seeing is much more lateral movement and in power and it's the power the power in terms of control is going out back into the community so that the community can\nBetter access value can better implement efficiency and controls and we're seeing that and so many different ways and what's happening in the energy\nInfrastructure right now and it has huge implications actually for our society\nIt's interesting too I was thinking as Jeff was talking and I and the cameras up costs are controversial right\nI was thinking as Jeff was talking and and the cameras up costs are Carter first show right because people are worried about too many cameras and in turn into their lives but\nClearly you mentioned Jeff are couple of situations of crime an accident where there are very valuable but it's certainly opens up I use a lot of cameras at different locations and they're incredible what they do and how much how little energy they use but\nIt brings up sinking about it's a little off base but so we're seeing it appears to me and I want you guys to comment and set you particular\nMake it successful have an impact on the environment and the economy and may be build on that Seth\nHow 'bout you what are the things that I'd like to say I'm looking forward to ... energy offices of energy resources energy program and the implementation plans to win that are supposed to come in the\nSpring I Believe road is the more we're working towards a\n... right well you guys did a terrific job as usual Geoff good senior against seconds later so\nWell you guys did a terrific job as usual Geoff good senior against you later we'll hear Jay good jobs being a good thing you again particularly with your shirt on and on\nThis is the new album out radio network W are in the

B. Mason for all of your office courteous furniture and by colonial printing all your sustainable printing needs [noise]\nWelcome to renewable now with your host Peter often\nFor the next hour ruined about greener side a bit [noise] and now he's your house to eat or operate thank you so much\nThe back every one to renewable now we hope you've been on renewable now that is this week we are not only promoting the one of our own events but we have a great story about\nWind energy and wind development around the world um we highlighted some of the great some of the great sites and some of the things that are very positive around renewables and in particular\nAround when I Want to welcome Costa Andy Roddick you appear that's good to see you good to be ... you and I of course they're going to be chatting with Dr David did well he uh with marine affairs College of the environment and life science at you are right Bruce\nLots to talk about as it relates to renewable energy in particular wind and public acceptance\nTalk about as it relates to renewable energy in particular wind and public acceptance\nThere are a lot of good work coming out of your eye river or some planning from around the wind project and yeah so it will be interesting to have a conversation with them\nThey've got a lot of a series of lectures going on clearly it's a one of the things that's a top of their on certainly Dr David Wells team and what they're doing and and it's interesting because we're certainly going to talk about\nHow it played an important role as you did\nIn the west Warwick except for a year of being an off take her writing going a hundred percent renewable pure and seeing those click on next year and commentary subtle regard that will be good for us as always going to get a great update from youth thank you very much on some of the things going on\nThat impact either the greater the consumers or certainly the energy space in the environment\nHere in New England and in Rhode Island um\nAnd I just want to mention that on\nTuesday night I think we might be sold out now I'm not sure we promoted this week on the site and has always sent out invitations to everybody that is a listener in such a subscriber to renewable now so if you're not make sure you're joining us and you can reach us through all the social media as well\nWe are doing a conference we're doing a global town meeting with a world broadcast set the business of wind in the ocean state than we are so happy to welcome a miles grant from the national Wildlife Federation directive tuna communications who's going to be the host\nThat night I'm Jeff ... from deep water and isn't that an interesting topic [laughter] I always read Presley who did such a masterful job in West Warwick of helping to manage bronze earlier ... I'm from these issues among others very much very much\nWe're losing some of these issues among others very much very much and I think ... part of it is is ecological background right to the gym and so far um but he is pushing west Warwick into this whole new green economy be great to catch up with Hannah\nWho of course until recently random renewable energy for the marine and she's working with wind energy development down here in Rhode Island right on their shoes\nAnd of course one of our past gas and we love him to be a co host as well do you know Robert ... come\nVery warmer editor brought a murmur sure before you get a wonderful job that we've been staying in touch and kind of sharing information and so he\n... as you know we discuss that's right we discuss the books right they are too poor and yes and so he is going to bring a great which is fascinating run away with it is because I read it after the fact that after we talked to him yeah\nAnd certainly readily available right yup but he'll bring a fascinating perspective I think to the conversation because I like taking a look deeper look at Cape Wind and have we done things in Rhode Island because since we might get their first right as far as the first major\nOffshore development so all of that of course they can if they can still get a ticket they can be live at the ... headquarters are looking for a great oh I Can't wait the media room we're going to be doing for such major events a year\nHere at our global headquarters in Rhode Island strength and also of course they will be able to tune in and watch live animal archive it and and will be reporting on it over the next few weeks so before you and I\nBring on Dr David did well we're both anxious to do that and get into this conversation about his work has experience his team and his help in driving positive public acceptance of wind um give us an update\nDriving positive public acceptance of wind um give us an update\nUs so a couple of things that are of interest right now one is that uh\nUh the public utilities commission just recently issued an order on the electric companies infrastructure safety and reliability plant there I us our plan which is their plan that they have to do annually with regard to system upgrades to accommodate customer\nNeeds a upgrades to their distribution system and the order effectively in a nutshell said you know you got to go beyond what you've been doing historically and start to think about\nWhat improvements are necessary what great improvements are necessary to better interconnect generating customers because although they planned or something like sixty five million dollars of\nOf capacity upgrades in the last round of planning none of them contemplated ah in additional demands of inter connecting customers who was on customer it was all\nConsuming custom okay and so we interviewed me and I actually intervening on behalf of a client or make that argument that you know we need to start thinking about the good of tomorrow\nAnd how we need to accommodate a generation demands as well a man and we weren't although we weren't accepted into the case 'cause we were there were objections from National Guard and the division\nA ultimately the commission took that message to heart which would be the public utilities commission yeah ... okay and so that's a big step forward congratulations Mary and tragic grades other thing is is that a recently there have been proceedings overweight filing that you may be aware of it and that's where the seeking to assess a\nAccess fee on the distribution customers that didn't have associated load\nAnd we'd been arguing that point ah also about a new customer charge that they're seeking to implement and seemed to have made pretty good headway and those are\nFoster murder charge that they're seeking to implement and seemed to have made pretty good headway and those arguments that commission seems very skeptical of the filing seems likely that we're going to get into a stakeholder process to design a better approach to future a\nCost allocation for the grid in front of mentally address the\nCentral question of whether distributed generation has a net cost or in that benefit to the distribution system obviously we would argue that we ... we need to consider the benefits that did she provides to the grid or as part of the equation of who pays what in terms of supporting the cost\nThat additional fee seen on the air wasn't part of that retroactive so if I already was which I Am providing a local energy to solar on our warehouse I was gonna get detained right yeah well\nThe fear will never applied to to generation that had load associated with it so you wouldn't have been subject to all our because you do have load there that you're serving but [noise]\nBut ah for free standing generation projects like D G projects or renewable energy guy that rejects or public enemy net metering projects like west work is considering a is going to do actually\nThe ah you know that would have been a big burden and yes it apply it was proposed to apply to existing projects so\nYou know they would have gone through financing and everything and all of a sudden have a few that they didn't want to know how is that it's not fair the commission really didn't like that that was one of the center of huge red flag to them\nWas a seems to have driven some of their skepticism\nOn sending a client a A N n voice a year later saying hey I have this additional fee and up and it applies to your case they get a hockey stick with that I Would like\nIn their head and you're you that I Would like but [laughter]\nAt least they'd be tripping you right in the road so it's blatantly unfair so that is really good work now one question and then we'll introduce Dr ... well bring him on\nAs you were starting to talk about and explain all that the one thing I was thinking about you and I have had a lot of discussions with some terrific guests around the greed of the future yeah and these micro grades\nFind ways of producing a larger share of our electricity more locally closer to home it it provides a greater security of the the energy source in addition to providing more electricity we have our our needs grow all the time for electricity\nAnd then putting it back to the climate issue is people also support renewable electricity sources because of this opportunity to reduce emissions\nWhether it's a emissions for air quality and health or these climate causing emissions and and trying to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions and so those are some of the reasons I think that people are turning towards these renewal energy system\nAre some of the reasons I think that people are turning towards these are new whole energy system I'm looking at those as as possibilities and so that that sort of the pie in of how I got interested in is if you're going to look for solutions you often need to understand some of the social implications as well\nInteresting well I I actually attended\nConference call yesterday uh\nWhere are the union of Concerned Scientists were talking about resilience with regard to power plant\nLocations and threat to her parents most of which are located right on the water because they use so much water and their generation I thought that was interesting a lot of substitutions\nOr within ... as a result of climate or impacting water levels and what that means for where they see the\nUnion of concerned yeah cameras based in DC but yeah I can send you the rain in prison to the doctor\nSaid well we're going to go to break in about three minutes but it gives us enough time for you to tell us about your group and in that process you can tell us why Rhode Island why you are I in is that since we're glad to have you here\nUm but really kind of the main focus your clothes and is part of it are you are I kind of stepping up and being a leader in mapping kind of ocean survival and adaptations\nWell I think it's also in second exciting time to be in Rhode Island in terms of ocean based energy and the provost here you are a few years ago at Fort than negative to try to grow the for the city University in that area\nAnd so they they made a couple of higher last year and I was one of those on official find side\nMade a couple of higher last year and I was one of those social science side\nAnd then they hire someone in engineering as well just to try to build the expertise and found the excitement around the sun and maybe bring a little cohesion to people around the university that have been doing this work\nUm and and really raising our profile I'm Around that and certainly the block island wind farm out to attract attention to the state around the idea of of ocean renewable energy\nAnd not just that set but certainly some of the onshore things that we are seeing I think you and I would both agree with Dr mid well it's an exciting time to be here we are in transformation there's a resurgence in Rhode Island we have amazing natural resources we have incredible academia right you know you are right\nUm I think we have a government and we're going to ask\nDr did well later about government getting kind of accept things are changing around a renewables and so I Would agree with him I think it's a it's a

R. I. on line and I know there's a schedule there and information about the speakers and it's a it's a really nice so diverse\nMix of people doing different kinds of of work here on around me energy issue an excellent\nYou know everyone has a pretty good feel for how set the newly sealed up this migration away from those of you to tend to lean in green green economy and like your thoughts your personal thoughts generally do you support\nAnd you recently came from Michigan um do you support offshore wind um obviously you worked in the Marines side what what are the kind of the environmental hazards\nThat you think about and whether the turbines that start to spin um increase those in in in innocence as part of your friends or do you see wind here regionally locally as a as a player you know we put our our future\n[noise] so you know from a personal point of view I my background for a long time as environmental I worked as an environmental educator and one career and then a sort of helped people deal with um environmental planning in a in a second career I think if this is my\nMy third career so I I've been interested in the environmental along I think I'd\nA transition to um different kinds of of energy sources is important for lots of different reasons I'm certainly the climate issue is is one of those and I\nI think you you know ... you and and I we're we're not alone in this right um society in as as a larger I'm sort of group both here in the United states and and in other parts of the world as well\nHave really been opening their eyes to this this possibility of\nOh I have really been opening their eyes to this this possibility of renewable energy and\nThat they are somewhat disinterested said that they had deep insurance than they oppose it for purely financial reasons and I think Bob did a great job of well illustrating that give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable new\nIt only takes ... minutes to find out if you may have pre diabetes and you can do it and do I have pre diabetes that or if you're probably not going to argue kids were listening to the radio you're busy which is great because people can't get pre diabetes mine and I read that run\nThey can warm\nAnd I read that run\nThey can do visit do I have pre diabetes that Oregon take a short\nBecause pre diabetes can be reversed\n... by the ad council and it's free diet

recycled dot org a public service advertisements broke you buy cheap America beautiful and yet council\nThis is our in in the renewable now ... with a stain ability makes sense\nWith a stain ability makes and\nThanks so much for being with us Andy is with us and David did well who is Dr David below marina ... college in the environment and life science we're really getting to the essence of who is ... some of this opposition what is their self interest will let Dr ... will come in and finish up but I Want to take\nA specific book you use that I and the wind is and I didn't realize it was a little bit dead right now lives in some of their ... their ... finish up that list dot to did well and then you know we're going to George specific maybe examples of what's going on with these two projects\n[noise] so yeah so what we were just mentioning is this idea that there's a very vocal minority which may have political power who can who can cause obstruction for a process um there's a couple of other different things that you can say people\nAre very positive towards renewable energy but that doesn't mean that they are supportive of any renewable energy project there may be criteria for them for supporting a specific project things like the actual design of the project or where it cited or even factors\nAround who the developer is and whether they trust them or not\nManagement here in Rhode Island deepwater doctor right is a is deemed to be too expensive in some news\nIt's some some views are absolutely concerned about that so prices is one of the other kinds of\nCriteria that people might have for support\nOr or not support um issues around up the process to do people feel like the process for developing it was fair and engaged other people's values and interests or that the distribution of of the benefits and the impacts are fair\nAnd then there's a there's another piece it's been getting a lot of attention recently which has more\nAnd then there's a there's another piece that's been getting a lot of attention recently which has more to do with the symbolic I'm meaning of landscape so when someone with an area where they see an area as being particularly special to them um\nThey identify with that landscape and when you have anything that changes that landscape\nThat they consider it a a threat to them personally\nAnd and certainly when you talk about the ocean people have very strong emotional ties to the ocean and you know ... for some people putting an industrial use like putting up big wind turbines is is considered a almost in a front\nTo this thing that they that they cherish I'm into that that can be one of the reasons as well and and like I said you tend to get these coalitions of people who are maybe through lots of these different kinds of reasons come together to either support or or oppose a project\nThat's a good listener headset that's fascinating thank you very much it's interesting social science So Peter was referring to you know one of the things that we can go deep into in his book American you were in the Koch brothers property you know she uh in oyster harbors\nAnd in your hand and support in there a\nFew in a huge amount of funding into the opposition to that project and not only because of their interest in the community\nOr which is a wealthy community a lot of ... you have there since the resorts there but also because of his interest in ... which is significant as you know so\nBut there's there are other examples I mean I was involved in ah the effort to try to say that you're born in Jamestown Rhode\nIn uh the effort to try to fight a turbine in Jamestown Rhode\nWhich is a a\nA very beautiful community a turban was going to go right next to the Newport bridge in over a wastewater treatment plant there so now it's just part of Jamestown but there there's still people that have significant means that retired to Jamestown build beautiful houses or how beautiful houses and say\nThis isn't you know I didn't come here to look at the industrial side of yeah there's a lot of our our society I wanted to come here to get away [noise]\nAnd ah you know that this comes back to this idea of what kind of sacrifices are we willing to make as people in order to serve a larger purpose and that's that's something that environmentalists struggle why why don't you bowl and the answer this\nSo Dr then where are we at generally do you think you just talked about it there's a little bit of a dichotomy there seems to be general public endorsement in the oven and acceptance of of renewables maybe not always win but\nSo what is going to be the driver to get us to where there's high public acceptance\nUm and also to you both believe that the public officials government officials you mentioned the PUC here in Rhode Island that are deciding a lot of these\nCases and trying to balance our consumer demand with energy or availability and do you both believe those officials have kind of undergoing what David cause I'm an attitude of change\nYou know\nI\nCan weeks ago I was down at the American wind energy association offshore when I can imagine\nThe association offshore wind meeting\nAnd as you can imagine there's hundreds of people there who are all interested in this exact question you know what do you do that changes\nUm the way that people are thinking about this and and start the ball rolling so a lot of them are very excited about the block island project and thinking that that can help to change\nHow people think about um offshore wind by actually having an example that people can look at it is kind of nice to people from Rhode Island are kind of walking around like rock stars\nThese group [laughter] um\nBut you know the other places that they're looking is is one of policy and how can you use policy as a way of\nCreating markets that will create more incentives for developing these sorts of things ... UC right now in Massachusetts they're working on legislature legislation\nThat would not just create um a criteria for how much of the energy sold in the state has to be renewable but actually putting in um\n[noise] uh uh uh uh the\nFor offshore produced wind\nUm energy in to to that so those kinds of policies are a big interests and one of the reasons why those policies are a big interest as if they want to create what they call a pipeline of projects which is knowing\nThat there's predictably going to be\nThese large projects that are under construction for a number of years and the main reason for doing that is that one of the reasons that that people support offshore wind is because they think it's going to bring benefits to the states and the communities in terms of\nReally bad\nKnow\nIndeed\nMean standing here a\nLong long time ago\nUm\nThe lady\nYou're listening to W.

during a teacher at the dance factory here an animal in downtown\nI'm so first off a missed why thank you for coming in today how are you [laughter]\nI'm so originally I had met someone when I ran for city council I met someone who is with the organization\nAnd then when it explains it's kind of the services and resources that are the society offers also just start and could you give just give us a ... a piece a brief bio about yourself and kind of what you do\nOkay I'll Try to keep that when we [laughter]\nUh so uh uh as you said my name is married wire and I actually live in Mansfield, Massachusetts um and have lived in New England for\nForty eight years um but I'm not a born and bred here I was born in Detroit Michigan and that's where I grew up um but I had the good fortune as a\nFairly young teenager of I'm meeting someone named Tom Sawyer\nYoung teenager of I'm meeting someone named Tom Sawyer who uh is now my husband a forty eight years and a together actually we both work in the ... than since the DePaul in two different capacities but do a lot of work for this society\nUm that's all volunteer work when I'm not doing that I'm I'm working with computer systems and software development systems at children's hospital in Boston um which I've been doing for twenty five years\nAnd prior to that uh for a while was a a ... a junior high math teacher a as well as of for a number of years a full time a mom raising three daughters\nWe've been pretty busy you're entirely alright awesome so I figure it's for the today show we could give an overview of decided what the society how it started with its mission is uh uh the resources that it offers to people and then we'll go into a current projects past projects and whatnot\nAre so to begin could choose a start by a just explain a little bit how the how the society or give a emissions mission of the society kind of how it how it all started\nHow this society all started it's actually a great story fascinating story and it goes back a number of years a hundred and eighty five years to be exact this society was formed in in Eighteen thirty three in Paris\nUm it was formed by six college students and their adult mentor whose name was Emmanuel by\nThe person who is usually credited for founding this society his name is Frederick always in them and he and his\nUm five colleagues their student colleagues I'm\nWanted to do something different besides sit around and\nPlease I'm really wanted to do something different besides sit around in the classroom so what they did a in the Eighteen hundreds\nWas spends a lot of time at the offices of Emmanuel by who owned a um newspaper office across the street from the Sorbonne where they went to college\nWhere they were going to school at the time and they um really sat around having discussions about all kinds of things from politics to\nReligion to philosophy and doing what college students do\n'em now you have to you have to picture what for\nIs like in Eighteen thirty three when this occurred this was hosts French Revolution another revolution going on industrial revolution time peasants who had been living in the country were coming into work in the new factories all springing up as part of the industrial revolution [noise]\nOkay I'm In the poor are the reason why the society exists and the person to person service that we give to the poor is what we are all about [noise] um and so\nAnd the only other point I wanted to make as I mentioned that were um that were affiliated with churches but we're not part of those churches we are independent lay organization that\nUm we use church facilities for some of our work we usually meet in on church facilities and so forth and the churches help us with fundraising\nBut we are not part of the church is independent organization you know\nUm and we collaborate with a lot of other organizations in the work that we do so some of the specifics that I'll be going into after this the that's the background that's the context in which we're talking about and I will be talking about the work that\nThat the ten conferences and ... which are integrated units of the district council about overall um I'll be talking about the work that all of us do here in the ... district\nA show I was always curious about that because we have a St Vincent appalled church here in outer borough too so I was always curious if that was a\n[laughter] connected if it wasn't and that's that's the former holy ghost or yes yep I'm which when they when the former St Joseph's church um\nWas a closed and the two churches merged they wanted to come up with another name and they wanted to very much represent service to the poor and so they chose to DePaul as their church name which makes it very confusing when you talk about their search name at our at our organization yeah layers of confusion it's interest but those are two different entities the church and the society\n[laughter] um [noise] so for the society water some of the the services in resources available to people what are some of the things uh that decided to actually helps within the community where some of things actually do [noise]\nWe are here to serve the poor in any way that we can remember no work to ...\nWe're here to serve the poor in any way that we can remember no work to Newark of charity is foreign to us so we started with a very basic food and there are several food pantries ... um that are run by the society um by our local conferences within the society\nUm there are outside of our district there are also soup kitchens or we don't run any specific soup kitchens though we uh collaborate with soup kitchens that are run\nI'm here in the area um there are a clothing centers let me talk first I'm Talking down or more more nationally\nTheir clothing centers there are um shelters there are dental clinics um there's a car there are there's a car donation program which allows us to um\nBring funds in to help fund all of these things there's a huge at the national level huge um disaster relief effort\nOr a rapid response team they've just been deployed down to Florida they they for most of the hurricanes that have happened or all of the hurricanes from Puerto Rico to Texas while they're down there all the time and we have a representative right here in the outer boroughs district\nWho actually just came back from I'm from Florida is part of that disaster relief effort Bob gears lives in North Anna borough [noise] um and belongs to one of our conferences there and so he's doing a lot of disaster relief\nUm and and representing us in that effort a services to the elderly or common a lot of conferences will visit nursing homes are we certainly provide a lot of financial assistance though the financial assistance\nIs part of a larger effort that we make which is to establish a person to person relationship with the people that we're assisting and assists\nSee I Wish a person to person relationship with the people that we're assisting and assist more than just their financial need but the whole person and the whole family and um and many more than just the financial needs but we do provide read a ranch\nHe utilities medical assistance transportation educational training a lot of things or whatever is an eat your into us whatever is the need mentoring programs um one conference in North out over in particular has a very active um mentoring program\nUm so it's a it's a vast ray and in addition to all of those charitable programs we also have\nA an advocacy arm called the voice of the poor you know I'm ... and we advocate for\nLegislative and other changes to societal steps to just societal um entities that are not working well for the people that were serving okay is is what we do as part of that advocacy\nAnd\nIn so doing and I'll talk a little more about the ... the specific things that we've done along those lines later but um but that is one one major part of what we're doing it's because we are if you see if if you see what it says right here we seek charity injustice yeah\nCharity being the giving a and helping and the aid that we give to those we serve injustice being\nSeeking justice for those we serve seeking justice to the systems\nThat might not be working in their favor [noise] gotcha so that's what ... what it's all about\nUm [noise] so when we went into society provides a uh the rent and financials or a screening process how how does what look what someone's experience when I'm let's say someone's need a financial assistance and they want to reach out to this\nExperience when I'm let's say someone's need a financial assistance and they want to reach out to the society what's that process like for them how do they actually go about doing so\nWell let me say that the answer to that as a little bit unique to the society and it is what sets us apart from most social service agencies\nBecause it was a major way that we help people or that we begin the process of helping people is by what I alluded to before which is the whole the whole visit mhm and it was ... we're on to the first taught us how to do that and that taught for ... and um how to do that and we've brought that down to the current day [noise]\nSo what happens is each of the conferences has a hotline\nAnd they will get a call on the hotline typically or someone might actually walk into the church office um who is in need and they will have a request for assistance\nThat caller's been referred to whoever is the current team at the at that church at that conference in that church who is currently\nIn usually we have rotations are different people are in charge for a two week period or a month period and so they will be referred to that team who will probe further on what exactly is the need and\nAnd for the most part um are making a home visit to that person or a family to learn more right in their home and he essentially not just to learn more and not just to to get information out of them\nBut to begin the process of establishing a relationship of of real friendship with them\nOf learning how to walk with them mhm um and so we go to their homes to buy to\nA which is how Rosalie round who taught us to do it many years ago [noise] um and we go there to try to to really understand\nDo it many years ago [noise] um and we go there and try to to really understand listening is the is the most active thing that we do there and and we go there to to listen to the need they're facing crises of they may be facing eviction they may be facing a chili shut off um they're facing\nWhat we've learned and and come through some of our our reading to be called the ... the ... journey of the moment\nOkay they just they're they're just totally paralyzed by all of it is going on in their lives right now and and many times that is the case and were there to listen and were there to help sort out\nUm but not tell them what to do where there were there and help them help themselves yeah the whole idea and the whole philosophy is to help them help themselves not for us to come in and be the answer to all of their needs a show [noise] um\nAnd in so doing they are able to um\nArticulate to us what exactly they're need is that would help them best to get back on their feet and then we will help hook them up with the appropriate resources and ... and those those resources are different for every single situation they're unique for every situation or to situations are the same\nAgenda that held the decided to give us a visit free for the community or is there a charge or what not\nKnow everything that we do everything that we received was donated and everything that we give as no strings attached um we do have a loan program it's new it's a micro loan program it's for a very special purpose um and it's it's really\nIt's really to help those who will be able to pay us back who wants to pay us back and do desperately need to establish credit because we actually were\nTo pay us back and do desperately need to establish credit because we actually work with a local thing harbor one is actually we work with are going on this long program and they're actually getting a loan from harbor one oh okay I'm In a very very low um interest rate that we've been able to negotiate\nAnd um and when they pay it back they've then establish credit probably for the first time in their lives yeah for many of them a positive credit history that will then help them move move forward wonderful and that is part of what we call our systemic change effort which is really changing attempting to not just\nIt's it's giving them a hand up not a handout yeah absolutely okay is is really what it is yeah okay\nOf them I'm so we've got the you know programs like we run a clothing center right here in our borough in Ninety five pine street oh it on a one Saturday morning a month and every I'm at the end of the summer

into 'em or whether it's a job that they need to find or whatever it is and usually sometimes is you know all of the above\nA they're working very much with them so that that program is is a very key one and a very important one we have another program um transportation is something that keeps a lot of people from being able to do what they need to do you um and we have um the gun a it's part of the consortium [noise]\nUh the program was called the ... program\nIt's part of a consortium [noise] uh the program was called the car program community access to rise is what the CIA our stance for there is a page on our website about it [noise]\nUm and the the YMCA runs the ah social responsibility alliance that is the consortium I'm from which this programs from and what it is is it's um we have a a a relationship with over\nAnd um people can go just like they go to to ask any other health they can go to their\nConference a hotline talk with whomever at that conference and if one of their needs among others is transportation uh getting to a ... you know even as far as Boston to a doctor's appointment but getting to the Ninety five pike street office where a lot of services are offered\nI'm getting anywhere that they need to get in order to for for basic services um\nTo food pantries to wherever it is um we at at no charge to them or through donated phones that we're using to run the program\nUm we will set up a cow right the the the Hoover ride for them uh and we also will set up as a round trip for them if they if they needed is round trip transportation and they're able to not have to worry about how they're going to get to and from all of the places that they need to get short of if\nThis is a program is about a year old now and um\nBut the seed came from the YMCA social responsibility alliance um [noise]\nThe um another program\nI mentioned the voice of the poor program the ethics you that we do I didn't mention that one of the things that we've done is run 'em every year all or most every year a legislator for um the last two have been it I'm just a community college uh in the late winter early spring and\nThe community college uh in the late winter early spring and\nThat is an opportunity for our local legislators um our state representatives and state senators\nUm to have an informal conversation with us and with anybody it's open to the public with anybody who wants to attend 'em about some of the issues that are of concern to us um and\nThe topics that get discussed are the topics that the people the audience wants to discuss yeah\nAnd so it's it's pretty wide open to the audience to decide on those topics and we haven't set a date for the next legislative form yet but we certainly hope when we have it that people from the community will come out for that will be publicized will get information to you and you can put it on your show have ... people know about it and um and uh and we have discussed\nYou know all of the um you know everything from problems of homelessness to [noise] um\nEducational issues to transportation to uh\nThere was health care I went to ... it's a well did you go to the last it was ... Barrows yes they do yeah maybe they land maybe very poor here yeah ... I think you might have been those three\nBut yeah there was a as you as in for our listeners that if you attend usually when you were walking down the hall there had of these big pieces of paper out there with the topics in criminal justice reform health care\nWhat you just mentioned education than we would put I think you have like maybe three stickers or so he put on on the ones who were most interested in hearing and then that's how they kinda ... though the discussion for it thank you follow him there [laughter] it was good information out there and it's like twenty friends next I absolutely but it's a lot of good information out there and it's kinda [noise]\nIt was also kind of way to update people to on kind of legislation that was going on at that time\nIt it it wasn't that certainly is\nTwo on kind of legislation that was going on at that time\nIt it it was and that's certainly an important part of our ... our our advocacy work we also I mean we advocate for a initiatives at the federal level at the state level at the local level okay so at the local level here in in ... we've done advocacy and with some successes in helping 'em\nA redirect some of the transportation to make it more useful to people in the hearing the Edinburgh area some of the public transportation that's available [noise]\nThe state level I'm ...
