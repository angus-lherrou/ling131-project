Thursday in Sunday looking kind of similar with the warmest whether a with seventies during the day and probably fifties at night still go as we have\nThese longer nights and days now even if it gets a little warm during the day I very tough to keep it warm at night because of these longer nights are able to cool things off\nIn the tropics we still have Leslie can you believe that when you're talking about this thing for over two weeks and yet it's not bothering anyone except shipping interests out in the middle of the Atlantic\nContinues to give our friends in Bermuda though a nice uh Patrick big swells maybe having fun there on the east side of the island or surfing there people out there know what they're doing in the water and they're having fun so that storm Leslie doing good now not being in the Caribbean yet but late this week we'll have to monitor that area's still signs of something forming their\nPossibly threatening the United states sometime next week the question will be how far west as if it's developed further west in the Caribbean than it would be more of a threat to the Gulf Coast area if it forms a little further east than it would be a threat to Florida and maybe uh the east coast so stay tuned on that we do have rose up bringing some rain\nAh the east coast so stay tuned on that and we do have rose up bringing some rain gum are good friends in needles California add a little rain the last couple of days\nIt's about time they need some rain this for sure I've been to drive down there\nWho dry you in death valley you had a little rain a again enough to wet the ground and Death Valley so they were again if we joke yesterday sticking their tongues out saying thank you very much the first rank some areas are out there in the deserts don't get rain for maybe maybe once or twice a year they get rain\nEspecially places like Death Valley in Phoenix still some rain a little bit of rain now starting to move up into the central Rockies of Denver getting into the rain\nAnd that is the remnants of Rosa which again a is doing good and bad bringing some random people would love to see other areas getting a few a minor mudslides so far it hasn't been anything too serious but\nA ... there in fact there may be another storm that's another one Sergio in the east Pacific that could threaten the ...\nA little further east so maybe more like Acapulco so if you only one that's going down to Mexico over the coming a week or two\nOf the action is picking up there as it usually does and again we'll have to monitor the Caribbean over the coming days one of our model continues to show something near Florida or in parts of the Carolinas that's the last thing they need and others show something getting into the Gulf of Mexico maybe New Orleans\nAnd one thing to shore drama land on this or whatever we get a storm down in that area even the threat of it uh and this is just the tip a weed many know when you think about it ah the price of oil goes up and therefore they start picking up the gas prices so high I highly recommend if anyone is thinking of getting gas maybe get it\nBy the end of this week because I can rest assured of something threatens the Gulf Coast and of course the the Gulf has all those oil rigs are they jacked up prices up on gasoline\nOr so next week would be the gas prices will likely rise of that storm forums\nIn a so next week would be the gas prices will likely rides with that storm or will there or my a thought of the day today is consider getting gas by this weekend fill up your tax bill that you don't get ripped off later next week\nYeah very good a good choice so you go I'll have another quick update next\nTo it and it's big enough gas prices that has a gym kind of I mentioned uh we actually have the latest updates from AAA where the gas prices are at least for this week\nWill they go up next week you never know I'm sure we'll have more updates from AAA later this month or next week as well as I write music continues on this Tuesday Morning now\n\n\nYou're listening to W.

while as you know we uh we started talking with our members of our senior center staff a couple of months ago and\nTalking with our members of our senior center staff a couple of months ago and we try to get people aware of what is actually going on at especially if a Larson senior center as you know by now I've said this many many times\nAre Larson senior center here in our borough is probably one of the most top senior centers and the state of Massachusetts sentence ultimately\nA it is a a it's a good thing to see because a lot of people may not know what's going on at our senior center Madeline McNeely was here a couple of a couple of months ago last month we had married Aspen all at least a soccer's today\nWe have more people are from who work with the senior center we have Melissa Tucker we have fire captain Allen rats and former his state representative John Webber who is on the board of directors as well [noise] excuse me I'm good morning all\nMorning oh he did that in the in in harmony here we are very good uh first of all I'm let's let's go to a let's go to Melissa for us to of course we want to get Melissa ... in the in the way here uh Melissa a little bit of background on of your background and what you do for our seniors at the senior center\nSo I then I'm with the senior Center for about twenty three years I'm an outreach worker there and just shine counselor I'm and basically try to we go out into the community and seniors come to the center and\nUm we assess their needs and try to keep them independent and safe in the home\nAnd for twenty three years are doing that um I mean people come in left and right every once in a while you're very busy um uh the are you also work of course not with that just with that but there's also other aspects that you work with race like the ... office as well\nCorrect on the child is a collaboration between the Arab or a police and fire\nCorrect on the child is a collaboration between the outer boroughs police and fire department and the personal county sheriff's department and you know we create programs we we do a lot of fun things but we also\nUm do a lot of education on different topics like that's some urgency preparedness and um [noise]\nCrime prevention id staffed\nNow with us also in Studio is John ... who was also on the uh the board of directors as well John good morning for you as well on a a basically a when you've been working with the senior Center for how many years now\nThat depends on what you consider to be working [noise] uh well yeah but I've been on the board or probably I don't know six eight years I see right\nI'm you know how how are you alerted on the state level you know what kind of alerts going out what kind of um you know there's something called the nine one one disability indicator form that if someone were to call nine one one you know they are that that program if you've signed up for it will tell first responders\nYou know they are that that program if you signed up for it will tell first responders that as they are approaching your response\nThat you know this person may have a hearing related disability and as they're approaching and trying to handle that situation they're gonna they're gonna modify their tactics on making sure that they're going to help that for the best way that will serve them\nOr we also distributing the kind of a big thing is we distribute backpacks\nAnd they're ... they're called go packs they're called ... they're called a lot of different things but they're really full of emergency supplies that\nYou know that that people need to put together so what we're doing is helping people start off with that comes with a lot of different materials your basic first aid kit you know we actually give them water for four days so it's purified water that will last for five years\nSo it you know water is one of the critical pieces are we give hygiene kits we give a can opener we give a one of the big items the flashlight with radio built into it that doesn't require batteries will wind up one so it's a lot of the kind of starter pack for for preparing for an emergency\n... you're basically going to be a you know if it's something that uh we were just saying a little while ago that sometimes when or\nSomething like this may go on I'm not just a the seniors it's also important for you and I together because we have no idea what may go on I mean\nYou know a lot of us here in the outer boroughs as you know you know live close to a train the train tracks actually run across the street from our studios or something like that happens that jumps to track war as I said you know with the uh the explosions recently uh you know in in here in the bay state a couple of weeks ago and\nAnd what the ah you know what the storms or you know right around the corner with with winter uh you never know some of the you know some of you and I are even some of our seniors ... ...\nUh you never know some of the you know some of you and I are even some of our seniors are ... or ... or parents\nOr may not may be stuck for a while I Know a few years ago you know the emergency preparedness here in the outer boroughs of was a very active especially not just around the wintertime but especially during summer because a hurricane's can be very uh a fatal every once in a while as well\nDefinitely and we we are working you know this is just one part of the program that our office really works with we do work with the Massachusetts emergency management agency and in local communities on ensuring that you know from our perspective people with disabilities or people with access some functional needs\nThe terminology which is you know that's not only people disability but it is a senior and the aging population and then the general population as well uh we do work with communities and email and they're planning to ensure that you know if they're going to open shelters\nThat to make sure that people are gonna be able to get in and use those shelters and not be turned away or to make sure that they are accessible for for everybody and you're right I'm every community is a little bit different you know you guys happen to have you know a train you know probably in an industrial train track around you I'm trying to\nSee if you don't have any I don't know if you have water around you I don't believe you do um but ... has to kind of\nTake into account what types of different emergency second half not only the manmade stuff which is you know the the scary part\nBut it's also the the the natural events the right you know an ice storm that big one that had central mass or the trains are having some sort of fill or something to that effect for fires or I'm really it's a it's an all hazards approach I Know that states in a\n... a ... they look at it from all different hazards and the local emergency management director for which there is one for every community does work and keeps in consultation with the Massachusetts emergency management agency to work on not only their local\nStation with the Massachusetts emergency management agency to work on not only their local plans but as well as the state of\nThe one one question I I've got to ask you on this as well because it just it just ... something that you talked about above not just the office on disability\nOr with emergency management is a civil defense I haven't really had too much on civil defense I haven't heard I Know when uh some of the hurricanes where here are back in the eighties like hurricane Gloria\nI remember driving from this radio stations home and then back because I had a sticker on in my vehicle or to make sure that I was a you know would come in in an outside of work from Providence ... at the time\nAnd uh but I always remember you know being civil defense being always around and ah of course uh you know the people who used to have the white hats and stuff like that for a civil defense is is that still a very more popular I'm a agency a nationally\nSo so I'm not sure it's called civil defense anymore it's more the they've split up into if if I remember correctly they split up into different kind of categories for community is the one is one big one that I Know is activated pretty frequently it's called the medical reserve corps right which and there's also another one called the search program which is the\nCommunity emergency response teams\nAnd I know I I had been a member of that in my local community where we are taught about light you know search and rescue how to shut off gas valve you know that would have been a ... you know it's a group of volunteers obviously through um so I'm I'm I don't know too much about if the civil defense\nUm type of program is still something that's commonly used now it's\nPretty much broken up into five or six you had it or is the third program the ... the I think there's police volunteer and fire volunteers groups but the the mass uh nothing is the um medical reserve corps a is a real big one that gets opened up a ticket and they help staff shelter\nOf course is a real big one that gets opened up a kitten and they help staff shelters and stuff like that\nIn the initial phase [noise] we have Jeff do get on the phone lines he is the assistant director of community services for the Massachusetts office on disability we also have Melissa Tucker also with us captain ... Alan ... from the fire department and former state representative and board member of the senior Senator John Webber\nI'm Kevin Matt ... I went through Jeff has been talking about it's a very very important issues uh and basically\nRight around the corner which we've been talking about ah this is something that are not just seniors should know about ah this is this event that's coming up later this month is going to be open to seniors and for you and I as well right\nUh that's correct that's going to be ah October twenty third over at the senior center and I really just going to be there during the presentation that's from one to two thirty right um and also I'm actually the day before\nI'll be there at ten o'clock during a fire safety talk uh-huh um and just for anybody that needs to know a fire prevention weeks coming up\nAnd um [noise] fire prevention is going to be doing I'm the same program will be going the open house at the federal fire station on Saturday the thirteenth from eleven to to ... so those are just you know three things that are coming up pretty quick\nWere in the month of October and pretty soon the stuff we hit the fan\nYeah ... basically you know that's something that uh some of that are a lot of people do realize you know if you've been doing that with the south of our fire station I Know a lot of times\nAt the at that station you also in the past have\nA check safety seats especially for the kids ah you've done that in many many times in the past as well yeah there's a there's a few ah um people or stuff on the fire departments that do that I'm In ... primarily most of the communities that's done by the police department um and there's some people on both the police him before\nBy the police department um and there's some people on both the police and the fire that will do the safety checks\nRight [noise] um you know with with Jeff talking with us on the phone life he's still on the air with us\nUm the other people can actually be you know kind of chime in John English or as well basically what with Jeff has been talking about is something that we I think we all and you can chime in as Well Jeff anytime a this is something we all should kind of know about a because this is something that's important to all of us\nYeah every it's up to everybody to take care of themselves and their family and their neighbors and\nThat's where you guys are showing you you're kind of funny when you were ... titled civil defense you're showing your age they're done and I'm and Jeff is completely right that's been kind of taken over by FEMA in ... which is a mess emergency management and also the ... program we have stripped program here in outer boroughs ... Mansfield\nUm and also the medical reserve corps been active in Edinburgh for many years and last time we had a shelter and out of all the medical reserve corps opened it up yeah and I\nI like the way you just said that 'cause I remember the civil defense director back in the eighties go around and said I'm ... that's that's a that's a that's going back a for a while 'cause I Know that to his son who was who was no longer with us it's got the the rousing square in South Alabama yeah oil you had the memorial down there as well I'm John I Know that you're\nYou want to you wanted to mention something I wanted to ask you Dominic or if you have a storm in which the\nPowers of and it's going to be a man seems to me is uh the ... looking historically oh the that getting power back on again is a is less possible then it was\nUsed to be when we had more people from the power power for a\nRight here in the city of out of a it's more regionalized yeah so the policy of considerable length of time and you've got\nIt's more regionalized yeah so the policy for considerable length of time and you've got a one of these emergency radios like will be in a pack\nOr can they listen to W. A. R. A. and therefore get updated information I mean the what a justice said is\nThere a local response is is that is a most critical because in Massachusetts or\nYou know unlike other parts of the country where you are divided up into important ... counties here we got three hundred and fifty one uh cities and towns of towns are you know a ... many of the very small numbers the city but still the question is\nAnd how to best provide it but I Know ... you know I've been actively involved with\nUm with what's happening with with the response there to ensure that people with disabilities are being a properly you know I'm not care for but being part of the equation grow um does it does that kind of help with your with your question I Can't\nPatients route or does it does that kind of help with your with your question I Can't speak for others\nSay well I yeah I mean I'm happy to hear that there are these uh\nUh apparently federally mandated updates to take place because uh\nThe it seems to me that we you know sometimes uh the difference between it you know I don't I wouldn't want to see politics got in a way I mean in during the Katrina situation you had a democratic governor you out every Republican president and and\nThose are the kinds of things and I think about as\nAs being a issues that are are becoming much more uh\nA difficult and so therefore I'm hoping that these plans or go forward regardless of the personalities involved are going to be in place for the for the folks in the local areas\nDefinitely and from what you know what I what what ice even my from my interactions you know the plan is constantly evolving and it doesn't matter you know obviously this directive from from FEMA directors probably from the governor to to me and my but there there's\nThere's an all inclusive kind of look or or planning\nThat's happening in Massachusetts so if I have to tell you we've come a long way since\nIt up and stuff so um which you know it just shows the great progress good right now you know\nNo one expected you know what happened in the in the ... valley so that I think you know I think there will be a little bit of learning that comes with that as with every emergency that\nBasically you know what we what we saw a couple of weeks ago where it could happen in anybody's neighborhood that's for sure and the you know when I go back to uh what happened here in March of Nineteen Ninety eight when a house exploded a with a you know with the gas line or two of\nEight when a house exploded a with a you know with the gas line or two of our ah of workers here in the outer area basically are no longer with us anymore and uh you know this is a it was on George Street here on the on the east side of Alabama and it's something hopefully that won't happen again\nBut that was a devastating thing uh 'cause I remember that one march fourth Nineteen Ninety eight and a\nHopefully as I said that uh that doesn't happen because that ... that was a that basically a stop the city of Alvaro for for a while a couple\nOf things I'd like to bring a vote emergencies yeah you know that if you go to the government is a plant forever them All right but there was a plan get practice does it get utilized people train on it or the people that are included in the plant aware of it\nAnd like Jeff said the backpacks she's going to be handed out or emergency personal packs\nAnd everybody should prepare to be on their own for the first three days yeah that's what you get the water you put food and you've got to take care of your pets we lost her power a few years ago I mean the ... power for five days so I thought I heard of yeah and you think you don't realize you know how many people are on oxygen\nWell that's generated by electricity you know they have the bottles as backup but you know we we respond to runs and somebody would have thirty empty bottles in their living room\nYou know and then finally the company just rented oxygen people need to charge up there a heart\nBatteries yeah you know because they have ... pacemakers um we had at least five or six people that would come in and have to charge up their medical devices that they needed to live so these are all things that need to be accounted for 'em and things that they may not be aware of\nI Know a lot of times when you talk about that uh you know a lot of people think you know All right we've got power on this list place doesn't have any power when you've got started hospital ran up the street here\nWhen the power when you've got ... ... hospital ran up the street here what happens if there's a power they have backup deaf definitely have backup but ah have you seen places that were completely out that people needed to get to you know when there's when there's a ... on a disaster and there\nWas in the same thing I mean ... well let's say the people that got the thirty empty oxygen tank yeah well they're ... they're not getting their power back we don't know how long do you take a stigma hospital yeah\nI mean now at the hospital heaven forbid the hospitals dealing with another type of ... catastrophe you know they also have to deal with these people that need oxygen to survive and it's a simple thing they just need the oxygen they can't get it without the electricity so now you're going to tie up resources at the hospital\nA and it and that's that becomes part of the disaster also\nAnd we see that uh that it it can happen any time you know going back to some of the other disasters ah I Know that ah that Jeff has also talked about and you guys as well\nI'm going back to one of the other items that are on our list or you have a fire in an industrial plant that could cause an evacuation or you know we've had some\nPlaces that were up in flames some years back the ... are here in ... uh back in the eighties\nAnything could happen I mean you never know I mean the building right across from us is is empty but they're still electricity and at the old foster building or something like that no ... you never know what could happen you know you've had a barrel and yes exactly the foreign to empower oh you've got that right that's right\nAnd ...\nThings you can't even discuss yet is how about the highway yeah yeah what Seventy percent of our goods travel on the highway you got Ninety five going right by two Ninety funding for Ninety five close but [noise] those those are things that you'd be surprised most people don't have any clue what the stuff that goes up and down the highway\nThings that you'd be surprised most people don't have any clue what the stuff that goes up and down the highway on a daily basis yeah you're right yeah\nSomething you know it and we've seen it in the past I remember I remember when I first started here in the eighties or there was a problem on Ninety five south um and it'll tanker roller rinks aptly yeah the driver exactly yeah I mean things like that people don't realize as you said be brought up a great point\nOr this happened it was not that far away from residents out there I mean it did happen to Ninety five but you know very important point of view\nIn you brought up fire ethical mossburg announcing yeah I had to have air quality rentals Marchman fire there's been numerous fires in the area that cause a hazard some problems and some of them are near the train tracks yeah\nYeah and you've got you know you've got the train tracks that are in the industrial area right here are in the residential area right here in or ... or ... or you know so you never know what what may happen it's uh it it as I said you don't want to scare people but\nIt is it can't both once you got to scare people somewhat to so they\nIt ... them to prepare yeah it's a ... and we're all guilty of it we all take for granted you know what I'm going to get that I'll get to get to that next week oh I'll get you know she could get the batteries for my smoked tech next week you know and then you know before you know what a weeks or months gone by oh yeah I got to go get that battery uh-huh and\nKnow one of the biggest things at least back in when this whole thing started and back to the seven\nThe biggest misconception was the fact that it was really number one the lack of personal prepared but people you know people in the community felt you know if something happens my\nMy ... going to be right at my door to help me and do whatever it is to be done but I Can't stress enough that what you had mentioned earlier was you know people need to plan for three days I think it'd be on their own at least at least three days so\nTo plan for you know three days I think it'd be on their own at least at least three days so having food and water in your home you know we're seeing a lot more rattling evacuating the shelters people are sheltering in place\nStaying staying home or staying with family and other friends\nWhere you know you need to have those supplies on hands you can successfully do that um you know it's just been kind of a bigger shift with different types of work has happened uh people are sheltering in place more and having that food and water for three to four days if not more you know but having the can opener that doesn't require electricity so\nYou know so you don't hurt yourself that's one of the major injuries that happened people trying to open cans with you know not using the right tools for it so I'm somebody supplies that will be supplying at that October twenty third meeting will be you know we have a can opener [laughter] a good can opener\nA and you know we were not given you food but that stuff that people will have to pick out for themselves but we are going to give you a least three days or merges you water so um\nAnd we do have less at the senior center and resources than booklets um that sort of spell out exactly what you need to prepare and what your disaster supply can't should contain so I Would encourage people to come in and pick up some of that free information and\nCan I can I share just a website regarding our program or emergency preparedness program because I think it would compliment what you said you had at the senior center we also have those work books on line on our website\nMhm um is that artificial or you're\nOkay so it's it's a the the the first one where does your of hair in this program information can be found at mass does go forward slash M. O. D. standing for mass office on disability forward slash prepare\nUm and there's all kinds of work books they're a bag you know how to get a bag on on how to get a bag but uh how to um what what types of items but when a bag\nOr some of the state efforts that are happening and then obviously the senior center is definitely a\nUh some of the state efforts that are happening and then obviously the senior center could definitely uh it's just you know try to give you some more local left\nMostly you've you've you know I'm you've you've been at the senior Center for the for over Thirty years now do you see a lot of these these people that Jeff was talking about asking for help and handouts you know just in case you need something like this you know\nListening to W.

A. radio dot com now Jim just in case there were two or three people out there who don't know who you are who are you why are you here and why do matter\n[laughter] I'm Jim Hawkins a I was elected state rep and the special election in April and the mayor resigned and I'm running for re election in November\nAnd the election November six to them as sex yes and uh you one of the primary in September\nI did I did yeah I actually have one a couple of races this year I Won the primary in March the special in April the primary in September yeah and one more to go in November you get used to campaigning I Am a the best part is knocking on doors or most people in ... are interested in the issues\nAnd want to know the candidates [noise] it's a very pleasant experience since you've been state rap all except for the numbers that don't make sense on the street\n[laughter] oh yeah the the street numbers don't make sense\nWhere I live in a Quincy or we're right on the ... the north Quincy border yet so one side of our street has a different ZIP Code than the other side of our street OK same street two different ZIP codes yet but so yeah I can be crazy yeah housing or either drop something off on ... street the other day and it goes from like for\nTo twenty two yeah he had to forty six yet [noise]\nNot that much room yeah um [noise] all kinds of remote correspondence\nComing in 'cause I forgot to turn the during or offer my phone yet I'm as state rep what has gone as you've expected and what has surprised you\nIt's all surprise me a first of all this is not as bipartisan as you would think ah we work very closely with Republicans on the other side of the aisle uh I've been involved with some legislation\nUh we work very closely with Republicans on the other side of the aisle uh I've been involved with some legislation with them and and it's a very friendly situation I think the optics are that we come from different parties and we have to attract different basis for voters but the reality is it's very congenial and supportive and everybody in the house\nNow a major push is to look out for people who are most vulnerable population from ... from everybody in that on that house floor\nGood that's how it ought to be yes yes yes\nYou know we look at the optics in Washington and and everything else and it's not like that at the state level it's it's a much more work I'm a I'm a nurse be much more functional we've actually gotten some very good legislation through this\nYou yeah I I'm an northeast snob I just think we're smarter up here but you're not supposed to say that out loud\nAll rats I just did a gym Hawkins is with us it's the cold weather that's what does it\nA lot of people are I think that yeah you have to you have to be more creative in more innovative and it goes way way back uh there there we go back to our discussion regarding Scandinavian countries\nWho I think have got things figured out pretty darn well yeah uh more than we do of course there are more homogenous population but still wow they seem to have things figured out more than more than we do what's your background where did you grow up what did you do what classes did you teach [laughter] I was\nBorn I was brought up in ... I Lived in Edinburgh since eighty three I bought my house and look a street in a mystery now where you are wall\nPoll hilltop her or wall poll rebel\nOr we go back as the rebel yeah you ... I think there's been some thought about that name sense\nYeah well there were always the hilltop person then John lead to a man who was a great football coach you have a great guy to his son Brian is now the head coach K pie but he changed the name from hilltop offers to rebels oh okay yeah so I always ask ... people or did you graduate before Nineteen sixty four after\nAfter I ... I guess I've been in my face\nDo you wait before Nineteen sixty four after and just after I ... I guess I've been to my fiftieth reunion oh yeah I went to like forty of last year [laughter] it's amazing how many of the stupid things I did people still remember [noise]\nFortunately none of them have all drunk and ask a page trying to take advantage of a woman but still they remember they remember my assaults on mailboxes which I regret terribly [laughter] but um your your your professional background professional\nOr I owned a gas station I managed to a family own chain of auto parts doors ... uh it's kind of a career change I decided when I was fifty to become a teacher and I tried it out of our high school I taught tenth grade math and a senior elected in financial literacy and then or are we knew what I needed to [laughter]\nI it's actually ... it's it's there has been ... we passed the civics film which unfortunately is stuck on the governor's desk\nOr to mandate civics in middle school which was a well thought out bill it included professional development for teachers to actually implement this ... I did not include a graduation requirement of gases already overbearing yeah so there are good good features of that building and there's also some talk about financial literacy\nUm [noise] curriculum mandated curriculum who should make a lot of sense 'cause a lot of things have changed in the last generation like credit scores identity theft ... a lot of ... and plus the ... the wild swings in the economy things that people need to plan for and kids don't think about those things they don't think long term\nAs to what the consequences are a lot of it will be valuable to include I think a lot of people support that maybe if we backed off on standardized testing a little bit you know make room for this in the in the high school agenda a way to do it\nThere's got to be some some level of standardized testing to find out whether or not the kids are learning anything but boy oh boy oh boy is it at least in my opinion a bit overboard now it it is it's changed a little bit\nOr is it at least in my opinion a bit overboard now it it is it's changed a little bit there's some there's some new new methods but when it just just four years ago when I retired the the math test as a tenth grade math teacher was three hours on Monday three hours on to all day and two hours on Wednesday\nA there was the foundation budget review commission and I testified in front of that will be three or four years ago for for the need for ... and they came up with four basic recommendations one was one was for a special ed funding there we go on was refunding for health care costs for for the staff\nOr the teacher and I just wrote out medical expenses and special needs because those are two areas that are completely different in the in the cost and the approach than they were in Nineteen Ninety three\nThe other the other one was English language learners he allows students in the fourth one was low income students\nOr the Senate passed a version I take the Senate the Senate passed their version before the U.S before the courts a rule the ... the millionaires tax ballot initiative are illegal they ruled against that yeah so the Senate may have thought that we had more and more revenue than we're actually going to have but\nSo the Senate may have thought that we had more and more revenue than we're actually going to have\nBut they they okay to version with all four of those version recommendations from the foundation budget review commission ... in there it doesn't it wasn't a money be able to just change the way the formula was was worded to accommodate for those for changes since the early nineties\nOr the house version only had funding for a formula for the uh health care costs and for the special ed class and I think in in fairness or some people were critical of the house version because it was more conservative [noise]\nUh those costs are easy to measure the ease the data is current easy to measure exactly what they clashed English language learners cost to kind of more confusing more complicated [laughter] we had the ... the aunts initiative a for English language emerging which didn't make any educational sense\nTwenty years ago which are messed up the cost of of teaching children to speak English and the schools and there was a reform a couple of years ago but his recent a difference between communities have different um different a language is that this that the uh people speak\nDifferent different dialects and also different people on the staff different skills who speak different languages which hard to compare the cost between communities\nUm that's not so straightforward and with the house version specified was have to be a study by December which isn't all that far away to come up with a formula that would've addressed those conflict complicated situations\nAnd the same really goes for a low income students because low income students are more more expensive to teach\nBut the ... a method of collecting the data is not just free and reduced lunch anymore ... a ...\nAnd in fact in some some districts that are provide food for everybody there is no data because then people don't apply for it anymore so\nDistricts that are provide food for everybody there is no doubt it because then people don't apply for it anymore so that measurement was a little more complicated not that you can't do it but they wanted to or they wanted to study to make it right before they actually implemented the law\nSo I don't really have an issue with that and it came across as being more conservative but really it wasn't it was being more careful mhm\nI and when they tried to resolve the two issues before the end of session it didn't work some some cities actually lost money under the new formula so they didn't it's it's it's wildly complicated wildly complicated and so uh\nIt's disappointing that that didn't pass a I I feel that it will in the ... early on in the new session and we will get that right yup at an answer to the uh question to the to the listener emails emails urging us to act on it is the most effective thing you can do\nNext we're talking to a gym Hawkins of your state representative and up for reelection I'm against a Republican candidate Julie hall on November sex\nIs it too late to register to vote October Seventeen plenty of time yes go register police folks please I think you would even say ah you don't have to vote for Jim Hawkins but darn it please vote yes yeah we just pass automatic voter registration to er which I'm a huge fan of yes welcome welcome to twenty Eighteen when everything is done electronically as it should be\nNo can you registering a flip phone no sorry I'm already registered I'm\nJim ... is with us we want to get to the opioid issue but we have another question in before I get to this remote correspondence regarding um schooling and and helping out people in the lower income brackets and the more difficult communities um we have to help the learning start even before they get to school in some ways\nYes there is a bill for breakfast after the bill breakfast after the bill Baptist after the bell yeah who which would which would you know we got [laughter]\nYeah who which would which would you know that we go [laughter] there is a bill and I'm an advocate for that that would that would after the bell is I'm not quite so shameful if you come in before the bell in and get your meal is pretty up who you're the poor kids\nYeah yeah I'm gonna ask you to up throw you store your headphones on 'cause we have a phone call coming in oh I think they're below the desk there and a ... agent uh we have a new remote correspondent age in Ninety four we will get to your remote correspondence right after this phone call at five away to two to one three to zero good morning\nMining Paul hello uh Sandy gym can you hear that okay I'm On yeah go ahead Sandy\nI'm your record I talk about Oprah ... and I'm I'm very concerned because I Lived in my neighborhood for over fifty years\nAnd all of us said well I've got people down on the ground in front of my house and in my neighborhood on other people's lawns that need of medical help what are we going to do about this\nUh will lose its I I don't know about your street that a\nDog lover but I I Will speak and I am as a resident and Aaron said sure and\nOn a street that I have lived for over fifty it\nOK I'm it never seen that before\nWell let's reach crisis levels or I knock on doors every day and I don't think there's a single day that I go by that I don't talk to somebody who just lost somebody\nClose to them to opioids I mean last like the the person's passed away a it's a scary scary epidemic uh we just pass some legislation or to help with the problem is the first is\nWe just pass some legislation or to help with the problem that first as education uh adult boroughs does very well we have the drop and center on north main street in the fourth Wednesday and every every month\nWhere people can do for a two to one first first hand meeting with the various outreach group that help people with recovery issues\nOr it's not just one person was probably a dozen different tables and the different different organizations that provide different a niche as in the service\nOr Arab arose police have three full time people whose job is to go around people just suffered from an overdose or and I'll Try to get them into recovery were ahead of the curve in education is the first part of the bill\nThe second the second part a of the bill was prescription management out of a good number of the people that are suffering from opioid addictions are it's not for recreational use its painkillers are prescribed by a doctor\nFor back back injury or a car accident or something like that and they become addicted\nA subscription management now it's believe it or not there's still some doctors get paper prescriptions which leaves room for abuse or in twenty twenty it's mandated that they will be electronic uh pharmacies can only give out half the prescription at a time so that they don't just get a handful of all the ways they get what they need for a couple of days\nWhen they come back to the second half of their prescription they don't have to pay another co pay\nA and the third part third part of the bill has to do with recovery we lost\nYou're not going to uh be recovered in Seventy two hours it it takes weeks and months to recover and there's a shortage of inpatient facilities we lost three mental hospitals in Massachusetts last year\nAnd some other reason for that is because it's not covered by insurance or the police is probably the right track most of the people who talk the most about\nThe edible polices probably when I talk most of the people who took the most about getting people into recovery 'cause that's what they do full time and they run into issues where somebody wants to get recovery and it's not covered by their insurance because they can't find a bit a that was addressed partly in this bill by changing some of the insurance regulations so the middle hospitals that are still\nFunctioning will get reimbursed properly by mass health and private insurance companies um it's a start we need to do more\nIf if this is an interest I should point out that I Am hosting a symposium on opioids and what we're doing in the community and the current the the new legislation on that October Seventeen\nIt's a full or hospital a it's eleven o'clock in the morning and there'll be a lot of experts there or there'll be a question a question and answer period at the end You're welcome to commit to open to the public it would ah I'd like RSVP if you can just so we we have an idea how many people to plan for it but it's not it's not required\nI'm asking I'm a senior say that's it I'm a widow I'm interested\nIn in\nIn things change\nYou know I don't think change you go to a store and somebody's laying out of the car yeah I mean this concern for me to sing yeah shopping at a at a scout Dora yup and they're hanging out at a car\nOr they're on the walkway are there are a\nThreat to the store I mean I Can't I Can't do anything about it I'm Seventy seven years old\nI treated my husband for cats that's like twenty five years and lost Kevin ... three years ago and I can't do anything I got to take care of me I don't know I I got a daycare\nAnd this is the national issue that three different people have asked about\nDoes Mr Hawkins support Liz Warren for president or does he like she should step down\n[laughter] headphone who should be president I'm not going there\nOkay I'm In uh\nLA is it this way if there's some concern about dysfunction at the national level and I think no matter which side of the political fence you're on didn't them concern that has become dysfunctional uh there's no compromise available and nothing happens ... and the answer is and this is why I'm doing this does is to support\nA local politician yes that's where you can make a difference and I feel like I I'm lucky I maybe I stepped in at the right time I don't know but I was able to make a difference in my first couple of months\nAnd that's that's that's what you can do about it\nKnow and then agent three sixty nine right softball question Haley ask my question which was what do you think of Senator Warren honest or dishonest both of those ...\nSenator Warren honest or dishonest Boko Haram boasts Pocahontas I guess if you average seven lies a day over a two year period that's better than one one lead scandal in your background but so listen before an honest or dishonest and then we'll get back to local stuff\nOn the Democratic so I I think my feelings in that are obvious\nAnd there it is Jim Hawkins is with is viable way to to to one three two zeroes the number a let's go to the phone lines at five a way to to to Thirteen twenty good morning\nGood morning politics ... how are you good Eddie how're you I'm doing a terrific next morning Jim how are you\nGood I didn't have the had told me that uh this is Eddie ... Rica calling somebody's going to tell me what to do so [laughter] ... that's your job no go ahead and say\nHey how I Am Paul I just bringing it back to the local ... impressed with a gym and how he has been able to put himself out in the community bringing it back to the local level and um he was a gentleman who absolutely listens more than he speaks\nAnd he's been a huge supporter ah of um [noise] the farmers' market every Saturday So we're pretty shape that of course it just come from a family who are families very involved with the community it's great and refreshing to see\nSome really puts himself out there and and put yourself out there in front of everyone all the types of Jim I'd like to thank you for that and thank you for listening more than you speak and really taking in every constituency concerns and uh that's very admirable and not something to see a lot of these days well thank\nYou thank you for the call and thank you for you and your family does with a farmer's market\nA that is such an asset that so much what Adam was all about you do an awesome guy than you were countless hours round the clock on that thank you\nI well they got no thank you [laughter] [laughter] I'll have a great ball I have a great day Jim Guy\nKeep up the great work close to you or Saturday\nI'll have a great I have a great day or were you a Saturday or take care of their ... you should mentioned also Saturday\nThey're selling pumpkins in corn stalks and the money benefits that he'd been food pan oh I'm standing so every dollar that that raises for the food pantry actually allows him to get twenty dollars worth of food from the Boston food bank was this Saturday I think it's\nI'm not looking at I think it's ten dollars you get a pumpkin and the corn stock is it's it's not a lotta money mhm\nWell well I'll get the accurate information on that before Saturday um he said you listen more than you speak I don't think anyone has ever said that to me my entire life [laughter]\n\nI'm Jim ... is with us ah we are or were two minutes away for a break um and I want to get this question out there are your opponent is Julie hall yes a former city councilor\nUm who's a solid candidate yes ... you know ... is a solid candidate a lot of experience why as Jim Hawkins in your opinion the better choice for state rep then Julie hall or\nI'm retired and this is not a career for me I'm going to be Seventy next year I have no aspirations to higher office a and unable to do this job seven days a week twenty four seven uh and I think the lack of strings attached on not getting a family obligations or anything else to do this there's no compromise\nAh I'm pretty good at working with other people are attracted a lot of support within the house for what I'm doing and I've gotten a lot done that way and I can continue in the next session I've already made plans for legislation that will help\nMostly the more vulnerable people in the city seniors low income seniors are for for the next session of already made those plans ...

Jim Hawkins a will be with us for about fourteen more minutes I'm ... about\nA boat [noise]\nToo specific nonspecific enough to specific oh okay I'm Sorry what um [noise] she could keep listening there's always plenty of things to criticize about me on this with this jealous for for crying out loud I'm you wanted to address senior citizens\nYes yes ah that's become a ... one of my priority issues or I did the food stamp challenged or maybe several weeks ago there was a challenge food stamp okay we've got to live on four dollars and fifty six cents a day for five days\nAnd ... probably the thing that uh caught my attention the most was going to talk to the seniors are waiting in line on Tuesday Morning if they even food pantry\nFirst of all I Can't imagine somebody to work their entire life having to wait in line for food and wait in line and the bad weather mhm um today's Tuesday they probably sitting out of the bad weather right now we're talking I Can't I Can't wrap my head around that\nBut one issue that person after person brought up to me and it doesn't have to do with the school override it just has to do with the way things are people living on a fixed income\nTen Fifteen Twenty years into their retirement the one thing that keeps going up is real estate taxes as an adult burrows is actually compared to other other communities in the state is low on real estate tax ...\nSleep compared to other other communities in the state is low on real estate tax ... real estate taxes keep going up I mean might have more than doubled since I bought my house um when was that eighty three well more more than doubled ... um\nSo the the issue is with a fixed income maybe a thousand dollars a month and the Social Security and a hundred bucks a month for food how\nHow are they going to afford all these real estate taxes and homes that they've lived in for decades they might get evicted from because they can't afford the real estate taxes um that really riveted my attention\nOr than just something that shouldn't happen shouldn't happen\nWell CEOs are making more money than ever and the top one percent just got eighty three percent of the recent tax cuts they're doing just fine Jim don't worry that will raise all boats\nYeah right right but hasn't raised those boats those people are on a fixed income it doesn't change as a [noise]\nAh there there is a coal of of like pennies every year that their income will go up not enough not the same as as taxes and food and heat and in electric bill and everything else but the real estate taxes are there by the scariest part\nWhile the clubs the Lenski from Tommy Boy All right step one we've identified the problem step to what's the answer hit\nIt's ten o'clock we're out of time but let's try to fit

writes in Paul hero was the only reason Democrats\nQuickly um remote correspondent rights and Paul hero was the only recent Democrat on beacon hill that voted against the Democrats which is why he wasn't able to accomplish anything writes the remote correspondent did you really not accomplish anything and was he punished for on occasion working with Republicans\nWhich um which is something that you look forward to doing\nAh I'll answer for myself I have done pretty well and I think I get um I think I get respect from the Democrats for the fact that I'm willing to go across the island work with Republicans okay I think that's a benefit for me or and what I Would do anyway because in this area\nThe ... round and representatives and senators in this area except for senator senior

E D M. A. O. L. O.\nU. related to James yes he's my brother yes and um are you also jealous of your brother Jonathan who know obviously your parents favorite\nOh that sucks but I Am a Paris favorite but you know what I let them all going into ... [laughter] that's the way I talk but I'm here to tell you something okay I Would love to run for governor of Massachusetts really I'll tell you why or even president but we can deal with trauma is the president saying he runs his stuff\nBut um yeah I have a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst\nRuns this stuff but um yeah I have a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst in legal studies and I have a minor in philosophy so I'm just basically running for governor I\nAnd there is like well I like to do it you know like ... starting with like you know school community city council that kind of thing but when I was in high school\nI did the school committee how hasn't left it from my\nOldest school left me into a\n... I'm trying to think of is the school committee and I was taped everyday I eleventh grade and I learned how to talk to people I learned how to deal with situations that are without the Aspen yeah I mean are you going to change you know what I'm saying this is where it's but it's the same time I don't want people to grow up hating anymore\nYou know it's time to make peace in this world to claim society as it is and stop\nYou know what I'm saying it's not the killing stopped the ISIS stopped the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv or\n[laughter] well it can be like stress you can spread it about even though you are not aware of that you're doing\nStress you can spread it about even though you\nAre not aware of that you're doing it and none of us want to do that so there are two benefits for from flu vaccine individual protection and it also makes the community safer you're less likely to give it to someone else\nWow and an agent three sixty nine rights and if the vaccine is so good why we're there are so many deaths last year eighty thousand\nSure well first of all the vaccine is not a perfect vaccine we understand that it's a good vaccine and I'd like to quote that old French philosopher full tear off reminded\nUs waiting for perfection is the great enemy of the current good we've got a pretty good vaccine so we can still do a lot of good\nBut the answer agents three sixty nine inch question from a lot of people still didn't get vaccinated wow I mean we vaccinate\nTwo thirds of the people age sixty five an older and the United states each year a huge achievement but think of this a third of people at greatest risk those older person's never got vaccinated we need to get as much protection out there as possible\nDo they not get vaccinated 'cause they don't have access to it because they were afraid of it or because they're just dumb ignorant of it\nOr shall we say in different okay a number to access should not be a problem you know with Medicare you don't pay a dime you just go into your Medicare\nCard get your flu vaccine walk out with a big smile so it doesn't cost you a penny and most private insurance as first dollar coverage for flu vaccine so access is really not the big issue it's more [noise] getting around to\nIs really not the big issue it's more [noise] getting around to yeah and you're thinking it's important enough to do for yourself and others\nAnd something I'm usually guilty of the attitude that that only happens to the other guy\n[laughter] well it didn't happen to just the other guys last season yes you know those eighty thousand people who died somebody had to give them the flu wow so let's all not tried to do that\nThis coming season if you're older than six months of age ... sleeve get yourself vaccinated wow\nAnd get one of those neat a kitty band aids to wear and you are a few days absolutely right age and sex rights into the show at seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for a ... can you ask him about the shingles vaccine and whether that's recommended\nSo the shingles vaccine prevents obviously the illness shingles ... have a new shingles vaccine two doses recommended for every one who's healthy not immuno compromised age fifty\nAnd over and the best time to do it is between age fifty and sixty five\nBecause now most private insurance covers it once you get the age sixty five this is one where Medicare has put the shingles vaccine into what's called part D as a dog that's the prescription drug benefit and not everybody signs up for that\n... so do it early before you hit age sixty five but even if you're older than sixty five talk to your doctor about getting it it's really excellent vaccine\nOkay now Dr ... we're talking to a ...\nVaccine okay now Dr ... we're talking to a doctor bill Schaffner from the CDC are you part of the medical pharma industrial complex just calling us to put more money in your pocket or are you calling us because you really care about our health\nListen my wife would say for\nHeat because this because he loves it and he's dedicated to with these dedicated his whole life my professional life ... preventing disease which I think is the highest goal of medicine oh I'd love to lay on hands give antibiotics here people\nAbout what's even better is preventing the disease on the front end\nWow what a what a concept preventative medicine now aging forty eight this gentleman seems reluctant like me age I'm forty eight now we seem to agree on everything except politics\nSo um you're going to have you got other than that we get along just fine I'm you're gonna have to address the question again some of us\nWell I'm Irish German swarm thick and stubborn I'm so we'll have to address this again Asian forty eight says can the doctor changed my mind I'm not a fan of flu shots why does it seem like everyone who gets the vaccine gets the flu is that a bit of an exaggeration a doctor everyone gets the vaccine gets to the flow\nWell aged forty eight is exaggerating just a little bit in order to make a point there you first of all you can't get flu from the vaccine directly that's an old myth that's malarkey so let's get that out of our minds and of course there are people who get the vaccine\nThen subsequently gets genuine influenza but it's a modified infection it's not gonna last as long as you're less likely to get that really nasty complicates\nIt's not gonna last as long as you're less likely to get that really nasty complication of pneumonia and having to be hospitalized so although it's not a perfect vaccine mhm it's a good vaccine how long it's the best one science can produce for us right now\nWhile age in Eighteen ask is this shot only for children and the elderly like below ten and fifty five plus\nSo we have vaccines that are designed for children in the appropriate doses mhm and I should also mention that for people age sixty five and older\nThere are two vaccines specifically formulated for folks in that age group one is called high dose and the other one has a fancy name agitated vaccines which just means that has an immune stimulant and\nAsk your doctor or a pharmacist or about those vaccines because they seem to work better in people age sixty five\nAn older high dose or education\nOkay and against say that one more time just to beat it into people's heads high dose and\nAgile vented agile vented\nOkay that's tough for me that's probably the lab it but I've gotten written down high dose or agile vented and an agent to twenty four boy we're getting a lot of remote correspondence about this doctor usually we get two or three I Am ... of them here\nAgent to twenty four who's a science fiction writer he writes in in this address his age of forty aids question a lot of people I Know who get colds\nColds call it the flu [laughter] what's the difference between a cold and the flu\nSo this is not science fiction and [laughter] you know there is an enormous\nDistinction of colds and the flu virus or all\nThis distinction of colds and the flu virus are all ... viruses but colds give you a relatively mild infection from the neck up makes your throat sore and you're all stuffy\nBut flu gets down into your chest can cause bronchitis pneumonia\nMakes you so sick that you have to lie down and just kind of sleep puts you off your seed\nBody aches and pains it's the one that's associated with all those bad complications colds don't kill you flew is deadly wow\nAnd flow because at least in ammonia which restricts you're breathing and and that's what the that's the deadly part\nThat's the deadly part and it also sets get this yep all it sets up an inflammatory reaction throughout your body this inflammatory response will continue even after you get over your acute viral infection you're coughing stops\nBut the inflammation will continue for another two weeks to months wow and it can involve the blood vessels to the brain\nAnd two of the heart and we've now learned that in the two weeks two a month after you recover from flu you can be an increased risk of heart attack and stroke wow do you need another reason\n[laughter] get vaccinated hello\n[laughter] I have [laughter] I have lots of questions written down for you but the remote correspondents or keep pouring in\nAsia in eighty six how lucky is that we give aged numbers are due to our devotion for the show get smart and this guy gets age in eighty six Maxwell smart very own age and number yes uh but he writes and do they still do the spray up the\nOur very own age or number yes

of all this year for people age to up to age fifty if you're\nOtherwise healthy okay give it a try\nIf you're over fifty do you have to go with the needle\nYou have to go with a needle I'm afraid

and so the way I stop myself from becoming addicted to soap operas as to not watch them because all you have to do is watch Fifteen minutes and you're hooked\nAnd you're gonna be hooked for the next couple of hours next couple of episodes and so my ah the way I avoid that is I just don't watch them\nBut I could not stop listening to this daytime drama known as the cabinet hearings I actually took time for more because I was working on a project put my\nKavanaugh hearings I actually took time from work because I was working on a project put my headphones on because of where I work people do that they'll potential talks to working on projects\nAnd they'll listen to music or whatever they listen to I don't know I I'm assuming it's mostly music but I put my headphones on and I was listening to hours and hours of testimony and counter testimony and responses and [noise]\nI don't know about you but there are days I think this country has gone absolutely crazy um to take a man who has served with distinction for almost Thirty years and to ruin his career\nOver allegations that occurred when this young man was in high school possibly\nTo destroy him simply because his politics are not your politics I just find that absolutely objectionable I Am not going to be little or or to um [noise]\nDemean or take away from a doctor Ford's um allegations something terrible happened to her when she was young something happened to her that changed her perspective on things\nAnd I'm not going to to again take away anything from victims of sexual abuse I understand what it can be like to be raped\nWhen I was in college I was actually the vice president of the rape Crisis Group and for three years or for three of the four years that that I was in college I staff the hotline and had to go to merge the rooms and\nHad to provide Murphy counseling to um victims of rape most of whom were were women\nTo um victims of rape most of whom were where women unfortunately\nAnd sadly [noise] so\nIt's a there are times I talk about um the inner cities and I flash my ghetto pass 'em to make me a um [noise] which [laughter] I always them at a loss for words to make me a maybe not an expert but someone who understands\nWhat it was like to what what the urban experiences like\nI'm not using the three of three years of experience we're staffing rape crisis troops to understand\nThe [noise] the whole makeup of of what it's like to be a survivor of rape and so I'm not taking anything away from Dr Ford but I question the timing I question the timing of these allegations\nI question some of her memories\nAnd perhaps even some of her accusations I question the politics involved in how this was handled I think for Dr forge benefit they should have come up a heck of a lot earlier in the process\nThis was a tactic in my opinion to destroy a man and by destroying him\nYou're destroying the agenda of the sitting president and I just find that so totally uncool and saw objectionable I may not agree with your politics\nI mean that agree with your philosophy but does that\nJustify just drawing a man's career because he's for ever damaged goods even if he becomes a Supreme\nBecause he's for ever damaged goods even if he becomes a Supreme Court justice he will always be accused people always see him as quote the rapist people will see him as the drunkard people will see him as the abuser\nRegardless of the fact that this man has led to an exemplary life for the last ... teen years regardless of the fact that he has been a good citizen\nAnd it's done a heck of a lot more for other people than than some of these ... who are accusing him and and I laugh at that one senator who claimed to be a Vietnam veteran\n... that was an absolute lie and as a veteran I take ...

S. dot com\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the drive time careers in business radio show with your host country Roman [noise]\nAh my friends who are back oh we've got good news [noise] this is the second month of the drive time careers in business radio show and I am so happy to tell you that the economy is checking Lon I've got some great news to share with you and I really am very excited\nI was a little bit worried about the NAFTA trade deal North American free trade agreement um it was a a deal between Mexico Canada the U.S to to an end kind of to promote trade between the three countries [noise] um but there were several positions that were kind of slipped in there there were certain they're deliberately or loopholes I'm not sure exactly what it was\nA but it was a bad deal for the U.S and I'll give you an example\nLet's say that um Mexico decides\nSimple let's say that um Mexico decides for that the U.S automakers decides you know what it's going to be cheaper for us to to have our cars built in Mexico because of the north American free trade agreement but how can we save even more money to bulk up profits\nWhat what they figure it out as a ... it can the car can be assembled in Mexico but basically all the components that um that the car is made from can be from other areas other sources [noise]\nSo that's what they were doing they were purchasing engines from China all of these parts from from different parts of the world bringing them to Mexico assembling them\nAnd then because that was assembled the NAFTA a trade 'em treaty trade area there were very very little to any taxes and duties applied to this finished product that was made in another country\nThat was good for companies because obviously by buying cheaper products from other countries\nUm they could keep the prices of their products load\n'em uh keep the cost of their products low keeps parts of the product high and the differences called profit um and so they could have really good profits\nUnfortunately that also meant that the Chinese could basically bypass import duties on on a Chinese made products coming to an America by siphoning them through Canada and through Mexico\nAnd so you would have these cars made with mostly let's say Chinese made components\nBut to paying no duties [noise]\nAnd it was just estimating our our our um\nOur industries [noise] Donald Trump a businessman regardless of everything that you call him racist sexist anti get whatever he is um politically I'm not saying that he is saying that he's been accused of all these things I'm including being a a a a Jew hater even though his favorite daughter is Jewish as our\nProfits were great for corporations and I I understand that the the desire and the desire for profit but when it's at the cost of your country ... I I ... I Do have a problem with that\nSo Trump realize this this was an issue renegotiate it the er the treaties with both Mexico and Canada and what does that mean for us that means now I'll give you an example and an automobile let's see let me go here\n\nOkay so here's here's one of the stipulations from the new treaty or with Mexico it says uh the new deal will require more of a vehicles parts to be made in North America in order for the car to be free from Paris\nIt requires a Seventy five percent of the parts must be made in Canada Mexico or the United states about twelve percentage points higher than under the original NAFTA this provision will help keep the production of car parts in the United states and bring back some production that moved abroad\nEven Ford Motor company applauded the agreement because they will support an integrated globally competitive automotive business in North America [noise] you know I don't know if they really feel that way because again the goals for all corporations to maximize profit\nThis will limit their profit\nBut I think they also understand that when there are disruptions to their ... their supply lines\nOr when legislation can get in the in the place or get in the way of a smooth production that can hurt their profits in the long run so I applaud Ford Motor company for at least whether they meant it a hundred percent or not at least they said it\nIt is good for us it just basically means that there is no\nAt least they said it it is good for us it just basically means that there's no more cheating allowed um and that or the ... the the the treaty is going to be monitored a little bit more closely there's another clause of the treaty that I like and this is something that people don't really know [noise] and [noise]\nAnd it's something that worries the heck out of China and maybe I'll add this and the China update I'll bring it back up but that is that any third party trade deals have to be subject to the rules of this um new NAFTA agreement so\nFor example Mexico cannot sign a site agreement with China\nTo to have them delivered automotive parts that they can turn to use in the production facilities um that are going to be subject to very little if no tariffs um same thing with Canada they can negotiate a side deal with with the Chinese [noise]\nUm if it impacts any of the production or any of the the the business that goes with the NAFTA\nIn essence the United states this little by little cutting cutting China off from the trading partners basically exercising veto power over other countries treaties now is that a good thing for those countries are ... probably not [noise]\nUm I don't know I mean you have to talk to Canada about what's what's best for Canada I can only tell you about what's best for America\nAnd what's best for America is that we have a a vibrant and strong manufacturing infrastructure in this country where we can supply where American manufacturers can supply everything from the semi conductors that are needed\nTo the raw metal till the finished product paints um lockers Leathers anything and everything that's needed to manufacture a product\nAs much as possible should be sourced manufactured and um\nAs much as possible should be sourced manufactured and I'm I'm completed here why because I Am a nationalist\nI I Am in America first or am I Am not an international list I I Wish every country well and I say let's compete and wherever your better at competing with me then you're going to have an advantage wherever I'm Better at competing with you that I'm going to have an advantage\nI I've talked about this every almost every week about the benefits of\nHaving a competitive level playing field because that's where American industry can do its best work\nProfits

that I Would\nNot seeing singing is definitely not one of my strong suits but [laughter] I Can't resist it's it's like catnip whenever\nI hear that so I can resists\nAlong to it you know keeping employees happy is not that difficult making employ so angry at you that you just walk off the ... they just walk out the door is also not difficult\nTo just to that I I read I don't know how true it is but it said the twenty five percent of all new employees leave within the first Ninety Days that sounds like a lot I don't think that's necessarily accurate I I have to really dig a little ... to see where those numbers come from but I Do know that many people\nA little deeper to to see where those numbers come from\nBut I Do know that many people I'm probably closer to maybe not a very ten employees will usually wind up leaving before day Ninety and many times it's because of of little things it's not because of something that's terrible or something that's horrible it's just\nThings that weren't done now give you an example I actually I I did a long presentation at at my job about how to how to keep people engaged and retain them\nThe first thing you days and the first thing that I recommend it was so simple and it makes so much sense and everyone says oh yeah I agree but yet they weren't it wasn't being done\nAnd that is on day one take your employee and introduce them to as many people as possible definitely to the decision makers and the company\nHad that employee feel important there is nothing more kind of aunts firing than you being a new employee and someone's taking you to meet the c._e._o. or the president of the company and the president looks at you and knows your name says\nHenry I'm so glad that you're on board were we had been looking for an HR manager just like you and we're so grateful to have you welcome\nLet my doors open any time you you have something that you want to share with me when I talk to me that door is open come on anytime\nThank you so much for for joining our team I'll be touching basically later on in the next in the next couple of weeks or so\nJust fact what twenty seconds that your that your city or the president has invested in a new employee that puts going to walk out that door\nWalking on air clicking his or her heels feeling like wow I'm In port absolutely it costs a lot of money to hire people and it costs a lot of money to get rid of people I'm telling you [laughter]\nKicked off a lot of money to get rid of some people\nSometimes it's a it's a um\nA lot of money to get rid of some people sometimes it's a it's a um a termination like a severance package that can be expensive sometimes it's litigation where you have to pay a settlement and that can be very expensive\nSo my response always is higher carefully make sure you're hiring the right person for the right job at the right time\nAnd once they're on board give them the tools that they need to be successful and one of the first tools is introduced them\nAgain this is the president is the CFO this is the the HR manager make sure that everyone knows the new employees name at least ... beforehand or just send them an email hey I'm coming over I instant message [noise]\nMake that new employee feel special also gives them a kind of a rough idea of what everybody does oh this is Sally an accounting she deals with accounts payable so\nIf you have any issues with with um accounts that need to be there haven't been that haven't paid that lady that talks to them\nThis is John and benefits any issues with your effort Malay or you were the medical benefits that's the person to speak with this is John he's a project manager he's working right now on our um on our um enhancement of our HR system\nI'm so he's the one to talk with when when we are going through that blackout period on such a side I mean just a brief descriptions of what kind of key players do how many people and lifting of the employees in the office that they work with and and their their titles and maybe a little bit of duties\nIt does take a little time 'cause it's got to keep it up as well as people come and go but happy in that little piece of paper again helps people understand how the company works I Know the thing that I've seen and I've been around the block more than watch\nBut I saw this company\nI've been around the block more than watch but I saw this company to company I was consulting for they would hire people there are salespeople [noise]\nThey go through this process of of interviewing and all the stuff that I think they never report they did just fine\nPerson would show up they said welcome aboard\nYou know today's your first day here's your phone here's the sales book go to it that actually happened to me back in Nineteen Ninety eight I'm not going to say the name of the company because quite frankly I've since forgotten them\nBut they hired me as a sales relationship manager\nAnd on day one they literally did exactly that\nThey put a phone in front of me they put a couple of scripts in front of me and they said go to it the goal is twenty thousand dollars you're first week I had no cotton picking idea what to do I never worked in that kind of environment\nI did I was a good sales guy I had a good had a great career and pharmaceutical industry\nBut just because I Know how to sell doesn't mean I Know how to sell in every situation or I don't know how to get leads I don't know how to qualify them I don't know how to to um I definitely know how to follow up and I just you know how to sell a product but what was the product\nHey they never gave me training that ended up training on the product that I was supposed to be selling they they never gave me um they never showed me kind of who makes a good prospect and who doesn't and how to go about it\nOr how to track I mean I didn't even have an applicant tracking system I'm supposed to keep track of that myself\nI worked for them for about two weeks [laughter] mostly I think mostly that was the time it took me to find another job I spent two weeks looking for another job as as as fast as I could because I could not get out of there fast enough and they were\nAs as fast as I could because I could not get out of there fast enough\nThat that make people happy\nWhen they when they recognize your accomplish when you recognize your accomplishments and you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars in an all these things a little ... a little a little note a card or a five dollar premium I'm having letting people go out and take an extra hour for lunch or leave early diesel the things\nThat make people feel that they are valuable they are important and that um it it ... you know they mean you mean something to

spend but men is it's so hard to earn it and to grow it\nI'm here to talk to you a little bit about what to do it's got a new job got a nice little pay raise thinks looking good you blow your first pay check good for you but now it's time to start thinking about your future\nIf you're new to the working world you've probably heard about this thing called a four O. one K. or for all three B. they're basically the same thing for one case for for profit organizations for all three B. is for not for profits that's really the only difference um the rules of the same everything else is pretty much the same\nWhy have a four one K. why saving a foreign located in a word tax savings towards tax savings\nWhen you put money into your four one K. it is used with what are called pre tax dollars I Know this is kind of basic stuff for a lot of your listeners bear with me 'cause I'm going to go a little further later on\nProbably driving home from a day at work but if you're over sixty chances are pretty good ... especially if you're in the business world or if you're a sales person you definitely know who Thomas watching wash\nThomas Watson made the word think famous Thomas Watson was the founder of IBM he was the c._e._o.\nOf international business machines he oversaw the company's growth from a sleepy little tabby leading machine company\nTo the powerhouse set it remains today IBM is still a very powerful organization I'm always impressed at how they can ... and Zach to keep up with the market\nMany computer companies have fallen by the wayside I mean I think of you know and see our um many of the main frames Wang computer all day companies but IBM is still around and I think it's because of the the personality and that ah the drive and that just eat the spirit of\nThe personality and that ah the drive and that just eat the spirit of who Thomas Watson was\nThomas watching was not born into money he was the fifth child the the last born son\nOf um [noise] I'm like almost the father's name John Henry you know a deer Thomas and Jane Fulton white Watson his oldest siblings were all girl so he was the\nThe fifth child and he was a boy his father was a farmer and he owned a very modest lumber business I'm In a town called painted posts a few miles west of on Myra\nIn the southern region of New York on a given Noel Myers I'm gonna have to look it up I I Know I've heard of Elmira um but I don't know where it is small town man he worked in the family farm went to a small school pretty much had an honor vengeful an annex citing\nLife um until things started happening but one thing that he was as he was good at finding opportunity like many many famous entrepreneurs\nHe didn't just wait around for something to come to him he actively sought opportunities but he uh\nHe took a job as a teacher pardon me hated it and then took a job or a earning six hours a week as a bookkeeper\nLater on he he joined up traveling salesman peddling organs and pianos around the farms um that was his first sales job he uh after two years of his life he realized that he would be earning Seventy dollars per week if you were on commission\nAnd so the fact that that he was making he was stuck at ten dollars a week working on straight pay when he could actually if you went on commission he could make up to Seventy dollars a week just infuriated him he he he left the job and what not\nUp to Seventy dollars per week just infuriated him he he he left a job and went out to to continue sickness fortune ... salt sewing machines um he just kept trying to find this opportunity and just the opportunities just weren't like available because there was a small town\n[noise] he\nSaid he was a this is from ... next job was pedaling shares the buffalo building and loan company for a hug stir [laughter] name see Baron a showman renowned for his disreputable conduct\nWitch Watson as a lifelong Methodist deployed Baron ... with the commission and the loan funds next watching open to butcher shop in Buffalo which failed\nLeaving watching with no money no investment and no job curious a man who it in the future be one of the richest most powerful most respected people in the world\nBut at that point in his life he was broke unemployed and probably despondent\nHave you ever felt that way there are times in our lives my friends when things are not going to be looking good for you you're going to be unemployed you're going to be broke you're going to be heartbroken\nAnd you got to sit there going what the heck do I do now sadly some people think that there's nothing left for them in this world and wants to exit and I'm telling you if you feel that way get help because tomorrow truly is another day and the opportunity of a lifetime\nCould be on your doorstep the very next day\nAnd if you're not there to grab that opportunity by the horns than who will who will grab that opportunity if you don't that's why I tell people when people are having bad times bad days bad month sometimes five years I say\nThe bad times bad days bad month sometimes bad years\nI say don't forget your second wind you will be okay\nIf you have a plan and if you're cognizant of what your skills are and if you don't know what your skills are find them and what you find them develop them home them Thomas Watson was a sales guy and he knew it and he was good at it um and so he decided that he was going to a exploited um\nThe says that are watching it acquired or an NPR casual strict cash register and put your shop\nUm for what she had to arrange transfer the estimate payments to the to the new owner because he had gone bankrupt\nOr I'm visiting NPR he met John rights and ask them for a job he was absolutely determined to join the company he repeatedly called on range until after a number of a board of attempts\nHe was finally hired as a sales apprentice apprentice to range again Thomas Watson was persistent he knew that there was an opportunity there and he was not going to let it go he was going to do whatever he needed to\nTo get that opportunity um he had a mentor who helped him\nUm and and at first he was not very good at sewing machines it was on it was not until until range kind of basically took him and and hand kind of held his hands through the process\nThat's when he became the most successful salesman and the east earning a blazing total with a hundred dollars per week remember this was in the Nineteen hundreds like Nineteen hundred or Nineteen or one night you know five that was a significant amount of cash in those days probably similar to about you know making two thousand three thousand dollars a week\nHe was assigned to to run 'em the agency in Rochester New York as an age and you got thirty five percent commission and\nYou see in Rochester New York as an age when he got thirty five percent commission and a report it directly to the second command at national cash register\nHe made and see our number a monopoly in Rochester\nHe he did it by knocking the competition and uh it says that sometimes he actually resorted to sabotage with a comparative machines I don't think that's the case\nI just think that the other machines are not as good as the machines that Thomas Watson was selling and he made a point to highlight the fact that his machines for superior\nI'm I think this is an editor needs to be a I I Do see a note that this was a recent edit that uh is attributable to a an author will probably knocks Thomas watching so ticket for what it's worth\n[noise] he um [noise] excuse me he was a man who saw opportunity he moved up in the company I'm\nA C. O. and says head of IBM\nHe said a hot Watson was hired as a general manager on may first um when the five companies um had about Thirteen hundred employees\nWithin four years revenues have doubled to nine million I'm In Nineteen twenty four ah he renamed this is Charles ... rent a rent ... who was the president of a that company a CPR makes twenty four they renamed it international business machines\nWatson built IBM into such a formidable company that the government filed a civil antitrust suits against it in Nineteen fifty two when Watson died in Nineteen fifty six IBM's revenues were eight hundred Ninety seven million in the company had Seventy two thousand five hundred employees\nWe're eight hundred Ninety seven million in the company had Seventy two thousand five hundred employees\nHe was an incredible man everywhere that that IBM had an office there were posters with a simple work\nThink that that he is he insisted that people come up with ideas that they experiment that they not get get 'em get comfortable in their ... and kind of where they are\nHe encouraged the company to invest in computers when everybody else was selling calculating machines the IBM machine was a machine that in Nineteen I think it was Nineteen fifty two\nPredicted I'm a a um [noise]\nI forget the name of the president not oh my goodness he's from the Midwest\nUm it'll come to me later on but the newspapers had predicted that do we was going to win and instead of doing um the the the president went oh my goodness I forgot who that if someone have to look it up on the way it's going to drive me crazy [noise]\nI guess what laws that I'm saying is I'm kind of some bling a little bit with the the segment I don't know why\nThomas Watson started out in life with very from very humble means he had a aunt in significant education was not a Harvard Man did not go to the finest schools\nAnd in return otherwise employees are losing money I've got a four O. one K. from one company I Need to get it out of there it's just been sitting there and basically it's just been sitting there um and it hasn't made any money at all I'm simply because the fees at this this particular company\nIs so big that it it eats up any of the returns that that that these funds are generating and I actually invested you know pretty balanced and um\nI figure I'm getting about a six percent return but the company's fees are about five and a half percent which means my portfolio only growing up point five percent so [noise]\nDefinitely employer tickled close look at the fees that companies charge because that's going to affect your employees bottom line [noise]\nUm I'm gonna move on to now ah to talk a little bit about doing your own deal\nSo the first thing you should do especially if your company has a matching program is maximize the amount of money that you can save you know four one K. balance your portfolios because that money is pretty chances are pretty good that you're going to be fine\nUm I Know that people did lose a lot of money in there for one case but that's because I think a lot of companies didn't really managed Portland case very well so\nBefore a warrant you you do have control over how your phone case invested and don't just to defer to the company because they may not have the best ideas about investing for you you do your own\nBecause they may not have the best ideas about investing for you you do your own make your own decisions in terms of where your phone when the money's going to be a saved or invested in cars that money's being invested\nBut there are many people like me who like to do their own deal and like to buy like to buy and sell stocks buying and selling stocks is a little bit like playing poker you're going to win and you're going to lose and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to lose big time and so I don't recommend\nIf you think you're going to make a lot of money by playing the stock market and doing day trading if you if you heard a commercial day traders make a hundred thousand dollars a year yeah but they didn't tell you that they can also was a hundred thousand dollars that day\nAnd that you have do you have to have a lot of liquidity to whether the ups and downs of uh of day trading it's like playing cards you have to understand what the market is doing and but for people who want to buy their own little pieces of companies here and there have been by all means having 'em like stock trading accounts\nAnd ... a an on line to talk of constant tripping over my words here is like basically like having a checking account or a savings account but do you use it to buy and sell stocks in the old days and I'm Talking Twenty years ago\nIf you want it to buy stocks or bonds or other kind of investment instruments you have to go to a stockbroker and that stock broker would buy us talk for you they would go into the market that go to pick up the phone and call someone who actually managed to stocks in place an order and an older would be placed and\nThen you would you know get your stocks and there would be actually be physical toxic if it gets you would have to pay a fee for every um you know for every stock trade and there was expensive it was about Seventy five two hundred dollars for every stock trades so you definitely didn't want to buy just a few stocks because it costs you money and it was basically the same amount of money if you purchase one stock or a hundred stocks\nBecause it costs you money and it was basically the same amount of money\nIf you purchase one stock or a hundred stocks I think what you got into a larger volume and um you have to pay kind of an extra fee but for the most part it was expensive and it was time consuming and kind of cumbersome 'cause you have to make a phone call yet to do this to that they had to make a phone call that a place in order\nUm stocks had to be kind of shift a certificate to be shipped you these days it's all on line there are several players um and and they're all very good there's ... there's alley investing there's Merrill Edge\nExcuse me [noise]\nThere there are many many many players out there um it depends on what you want to do whether you're starting out\nUm I you know if you want to go with low cost alley uh invest it costs you four Ninety five portrayed so they set up an account with them um you you you have a certain amount of money and the account\nAnd um whenever you want to buy stocks that say an ... and it can be as little as I think as little as a thousand dollars um let's see account minimum on America trade is zero an alley zero Merrill at zero eight trade five hundred dollars fidelity twenty five hundred dollars\nCharles Schwab thousand dollars all of these companies you put money in the in your account then you buy if you have ten thousand dollars you need to buy ten thousand dollars for the stock or with a company like America trade going to cost you six twenty five\nIf you buy one stock right for ten dollars is going to cost you six Ninety five so you actually want to buy you know and blocks\nAnd you can pretty much by any company ... are you interested in telling people that you are stock owner in um [noise] an apple that you're an apple stock owner by all means when you buy a share of apple\nApple that you're an apple stock owner by all means when you buy a share of Apple's stock you are officially a part owner of Apple's stock of course diluted by a hundred million shares but you are an owner of the company I'm you own part of the the the market capitalization of apple [noise]\nIf you um want to buy stock in let's say gee I don't know why you'd want to although I Would like to buy sucking gee because they're ... they're putting a nice headquarters in the seaport district in Boston and they are going to come back there right now this is I I think in my opinion this is a good opportunity to buy if you're a long term thinker\nTo buy the stock and by the way I Am going to be buying ... stock because I Believe in the company\nAnd I believe in their mission same thing for IBM\nAnd or I may very well throw a little bit of money and um they let your car company that I keep talking about and I might have such a terrible time with with names and product taste today I don't know why become a little bit distracted [noise]\nUm but once you you open your account it's easy to do it online treacherous some funds\nNow you're ready when you buy stocks it tells you the stocks that you have it'll tell you what the portfolio value was it tells you what you've um [noise] uh what you spent for it and hopefully the difference between what you spent for it and what it's worth hopefully it's but it's a positive number which means it's gained in value those are called capital gains\nAnd that's a very good thing when you have capital gains because that means that I'm you know you basically have made

I should say I'm I'm sure it'd be very interested in in a lot of that it's a and I'm sure it will take years and years before you run out of new properties the show because there are quite a few\nIf anyone's interested if they've got a historical house and they want to put it on the house to our please give me a call also um there are plenty of old houses in Edinburgh but um it doesn't seem as though people are that apt to\nAllow us to use their houses as much as it used to be so sometimes it's tied getting houses but if anybody's interested give me a call\nAgain I mean that's exactly what we're here for the ... people know how how they can get involved in the community to help but you know to help\nHelp preserve because I mean we've all seen as young as we drive around New England there's some communities that really have gone all out and trying to preserve a everything and anything that that they can\nWell and trying to preserve a everything and anything that the that they can um [noise]\nI Know that we had a you know some issues in the past you remember when we were talking about ... ah what did we caught historical rode\nThe scenic wrote on Minnick wrote ordinance yeah that would that we batted around for years and years and years and years and I'm nodding off the council for for years it has anything ever actually come of that as\nI Know we pretty well put it aside let's say yeah I'm not sure whether it will come back or not but um it's just something that the Massachusetts historical commission suggested that local historical conditions use as a tool to preserve the history so that's why we wanted to try and get it on the books but\nIt just doesn't work out all the time no it doesn't\nAnd unfortunately as time goes on to become fewer and fewer roads that probably sort of meet the criteria that\nAre feeling through buildings we all we have to one of the things we strive for is to find new uses for old buildings and hearing ... we've really done a good job with that you know there's a lot of buildings that have been a change totally from what they were originally to you know like the sweet house the first mass houses literacy sent up\nYou know the fire station is the senior center and I can go on and on and on and and it's just a great new uses for old buildings that need to remain standing and be a part of our heritage right\nNow and why not just like finding something to do with the building their good good musicians and it's it's making good utilization delivers the Senate building gets so much so much you send that's\nGorgeous building it really it really is and it's well built ... you know on they don't build 'em like they used to\nI think that's one of the kids are why a lot of the properties of survives over the years it was they really were well built compared to some of the stuff we see today\nYup my house as strong as anything he'd go to bang bang a nail into those\nYup my house as strong as anything he'd go to bang bang a nail into those sun beams by hand you and beans and you bend the nail over\n[laughter] that's pretty good\nI I met one of the difficulties people have when they said they they buy it older property like that and they want to stay with the historical theme make it seem timely it must be difficult sometimes to get materials and stuff that match up with the time Ira especially when you get further back there's lots of\nBusinesses out there now that really concentrate on that and and ah you know pride themselves and being available with all of restoration materials that you need and especially now that you are on line getting everything it doesn't matter where it is you can get it\n... well that's good to hear yeah oh yeah yeah so what other activities besides the historical commission society what other stuff have you been involved in over the years when I'm sure there's a lot of\nWhat I said I Belong to those two things but I also belong to be a A R and we're very we're very very proud of our little pack house the Seventeen twenty three house on on the corner of Elizabeth and knocked me that's earlier than my house\nIs now that that's basically right across where CBS yes it is for people want the snow you want to talk about what about what the DARE for so many people out there might not be familiar with ...\n... is a a national organization and Arab rose chapter was one of the ah earlier chapters started here in Massachusetts back in Nineteen oh one and uh it has to do with your genealogy mostly you have to prove that you are related to in a are descended from a\nPerson who was a patriot during the revolutionary war and uh you you have to go through all of the genealogy to prove that and then this what this this group does themselves as we try to preserve patriotism and we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we\nAnd we sponsor scholarships for a student and and we have different programs that we try to um praise the students who are into history and that type of thing uh but it's uh like I said it's a national organization\nThat's really written it and it's to chop the Houston since Nineteen all one yes it has well that's a that's a long well established younger decision yes and no did you get involved with that when you first moved to the community\nIs again it was when I was trying to track the history of my house and so um that that was one of the groups that I joined also but I'm also a member of the ... museum I oil paint I don't know if everybody knows that and I sell my paintings\nYeah so um I Do oil paints and um\nI can do them to order you've been anything all your life\nYou know I started hearing about the seventies and for ... the older folks that are watching this um maybe they remember either race either race was an art teacher here in ... and I took from her for ten years so um and I did things like on adult beds and and uh all the local things summer school at ... high and\nTwo for the ap courses that's really neat yeah and then I also belong to the triborough called that club\n[noise] oh yeah yeah my husband is the only remaining original member of the clubs dotted forty years ago this ... this year coming and um we've got a Nineteen sixty two Corvette and we've had it for thirty eight years and we um\nWill start you know you have thirty ... yes and um we love to go out and ride around in it and we've got a lot of a good friends in the core that club and it's\nGreat fun still you must get to meet a lot of people you know with all those shows top people are good people\nThat's great yeah that's what it snow there any uh activities and the community that you've thought about getting involved with it maybe haven't yet had the time or\nThink I've really between my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight ...\nBetween my husband and I we've got four kids and they're all married and given us eight grandchildren and one and a half great grandbabies wow so um that takes up you know\nA lot of time to move your and uh yeah so I think I'm actually involved in enough things with or without any more snow\nAgain when you when you first moved out of ... and you interested in researching the history of your house um that led to getting involved in community activities but um I think today\nThere are a lot of people out there that I find it a little bit harder to get involved in the community there not quite you know the the lifestyles of so much busier they work out of town um you have a suggestion for people who are thinking about gee at us you know I'd like to get involved with something that\nYou know when you started to say that something went through my head and it was something that my chemistry teacher in high school said to me and I've never forgotten it you always find the time to do the things you really want to do [laughter]\nYeah okay so if somebody really wants to do it there's so many things available in outer borough I mean there's a general allergy club at the library that does the YMCA has all these programs the library has a whole bunch of programs and then all these other groups that I've mentioned that I Belong to um\nEven even when you've worked at the factories this I I actually belong to the bell for retirees to the Goldwater schools\nThat's just because I worked out for a little while but um yeah I Know there there's plenty to do here in outer borough and you know if somebody really wants to do what they find a way so\nOkay so\nYou have any you know well is that people who are saying they they think the city should do this the city should do that do you have any things that you you would like to see the city maybe trend to do more of that maybe we're not right now\nThink the city's doing pretty good I think everything looks terrific I like some of the um\nThe like the lamp posts I'd like the lamp posts\nThe like the lamp posts I'd like the lamp post their their ... and and not brings back the character of the city that we we have had and and that proves where we came from we have to know where we came from to know where we're going so", "year":
