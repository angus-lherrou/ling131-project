I'm new to this too 'cause I was reading on line but there's the ... ah what what is far from the very beginning wouldn't use steam punk in general\nA steam punk was a term that was created by an author and Nineteen eighty seven and his name was K W Jeter and um he used it to describe the work that he and his contemporaries were doing which all had\nThe feel of nineteenth century aesthetics of the look of the Victorian era\nI'm inspired by H. G. wells and Jules Verne\nUm but usually a term that's used to say something is counter culture so kind of taking\nA the Victorian aesthetic and kind of turning it around and saying well what would they think of the future um with Victorian steam technology so that's why we call it a lot of the time retro future as them so people from the past\nThinking of the future talk a little time travel kind of feel to it\nA little bit but now it inhabits fashion and art and not only literature but music and all all aspects of culture can be steam pumped\nAbsolute altering along the river from wrong is a ... would you say it's a bunch of creative movement is that we used to be kind of the just the which is up and coming a movement basically\nOh we like to call it a maker movement because I'm maker implies all ...\nWe like to call it a maker movement because I'm maker implies all terms of creation so you don't have to be a creator you can take pieces that actually exist and put them together and still have it be steam punk and being made without you having to actually create the original pieces\nSo you know you can be a seamstress you can be an artist you can be any kind of person that would make things and you can be maker\nSo obsolete that's awesome and so for a couple of courses together but it's a ... rental conversation too but I'm\n... ... we were told to us being college started that how big is this movement is a nation wide as it started in New England ... river currently\nReally interesting and really funny to watch at some RC cars where you take the car body off and you put it\nCan really funny to watch as some RC cars where you take the car body off and you put a teapot on and then you race them around and then at the end of the race they do kind of like a drag race where they all just go as fast as possible and so it's a bunch of people in costumes racing tea pots and it's just a spectacle\nUm the last thing to happen in the buffer river walk is um some belly dancing so if you have any interest uh and different things that are happening on the ... river walk you will love to just kind of hang out there\nUm we have lots of vendors in the ... we have a full floor vendors and then um the outside driveways going to have vendors as well that's also our community area where we're going to have a lot of\nUm people in the community and um the people who I mentioned before citizens of anti offered um watch the steam punk festival red Ford empire um oddball knew who runs silk city steam punk which is a steam punk group online on Facebook\nUm splendid teapot racing will have a table um we're going to have a steam punk suffragette and a sister Yvonne voltage will have a table as well um so it's going to be a very interesting and so I had to make sonic lodge\nUm but if you decide to be more on the other side of town or you're going to go to the industrial museum where you're going to see a steam engine from mount Washington called right away in the parking lot of industrial museum and her name is ... because her um\nHer a chimney looks like a bottle of pepper sauce so that was her nickname and became her name\nUm across the street actually I'm Gary demars the president of demars brothers trucking is going to bring an eighty foot rake which is going to have a huge year on it which is kind of another troop of steam punk is a lot of ... years and these are\nThe one big heavy here so it's going to look really cool something that definitely take your photos with and then\nOne big heavy here so it's going to look really cool something that definitely take your photos with\nAnd then I'm inside the industry in Louisiana and we're going to have some programming but twice during the day uh last year we had an alternate reality game that ran all day long I'm this year we decided to condense it down into two hour long programs one in the morning and one in the afternoon and it's happening all inside the industrial museum so if you want to play\nThe alternate reality game for this year it's going to be down the industrial museum\nI'm so anybody who hasn't been to a steam punk festival um you can just come in Halloween costume and still have a really great time\nIt's awesome and how many are it sounds like it's going to be throughout the city as well how many places are you guys in ...\nAh I think a seven Venus I'm I forgot to mention at the park St ale house we're going to have all of our musicians playing there and uh I have the musicians names here we have um the old Howard troop\nUh may ... Hara\nKings serpent variety troop and we're finishing up the days with the kings musketeers and they're all really great they're really fun when you go to them they get you involved they get you up on your feet\nAnd the ... ale house has um is going to make some a specialty food for the day I'm steamed towards steam punk so it should be really interesting to go there\nYeah that's awesome solving goes tons of venues and there's this the third year this is our second you're searching you can do is there anything different from how different is it from the first of the surgeries are changing anything is going to be the same similar\nA lot of programming a half of it is similar to what we did last year like steam punk one oh one which is just something you should always have it a festival because there's always a first timer here um and things like um gizmos and gadgets which is just people talking about the things that they make\nLike um gizmos and gadgets which is just people talking about the things that they make because it's such a make or culture and also having the children's area we feel like that's very important to have to have something for the kids to do but\nOne thing I really wanted to highlight that's new this year is that I'm Aaron and Tyler from atomic help to me it's a photo company are going to have three photo meet up so you know what's better than getting up in costume getting up in costumes and having your picture taken by a professional that's way better so we have three photo meet ups\nAnd they're happening I'm In the ... lodge in front of the outer boroughs historic preservation societies academy building on Sanford street\nAnd we're also having one at the industrial museum so you'll be able to get your picture taken with pepper sauce with the gear inside the museum however you want it um there'll be at those places for certain times it's on the program which is on our website which is jewelry city steam punk dot com\nAnd so you can start planning your day around the photo meet ups and all the music and all the programming\nOr ... what's the time range when does the social store in ... and essentially\nSo artificial ours are ten AM to six PM um however some venues are closing it for including the adult borough area industrial museum the um the out of our public library and the United center a Methodist Church\nUm so those three venues are closing at four pm but park St ale house and the easy kill beats me sonic lodge will both be open 'til six o'clock awesome and I would just say the perjury all houses open afterwards they're having some more performers come in that evening\nAwesome cool um ... what are some of the characters are people ... some of your favorite characters are you've seen in first of all he was one of\n'em I have to in mind and it's really funny because they're actually friends I'm so they they must have made these costumes somewhat kind\nReally funny 'cause they're actually friends I'm so they must have made these costumes somewhat kind of in in tandem ah one of them is this man who made like a a teapot that he wears on his back\nAnd um it's not a working thing but he can get it to smoke oh who and so we have like this cool backpack that looks like the big teapot machine and it's it's really interesting\nAnd at one of the festivals I went to this year there's a woman started with kind of a post apocalyptic character and so she had this like mask hanging down in front of her and then when I took a look at her kind of backpack\nEquipment there was plants inside so it was like a breathing apparatus with the plants creating the air and I thought that was such a cool way to do a steam punk future\nYeah yeah absolutely yeah already folks were into another awkward who is the co director for the ... if I can talk jewelry cities ... festival happening ...

you on engineering from there is no pleasing are people I didn't think it would help yourself to a salad figure metal fatigue\nOr you don't mean to say but people here really believe all that stuff about mental fatigue causing that Japanese lied to break up and see what's\nFor all that stuff about mental Fifteen causing that Japanese lined to break up and see why not ... there's nothing that he knew about the idea of mental fatigue which practically official now my surely you don't believe official statements anymore\nOf course they had to make some kind of statement\nOr do something about it\nWell it's pretty much like Munich in so many other ... come to any I not go so far is that near enough if they can do it once and have the whole thing explained away for them they'll just be encouraged to do it again and go on doing it we ought to call their bluff months ago\nWho's left you know what I Need my story about things in the sea and those ... things and all that stuff about

scientific theories well I happen to know from somebody who used to know him the pocket joined the Communist Party when he first went up to the university and of course he's been working for the medicine and don't choose the he he didn't invent it I don't mean that\nYou know the whole thing was brought up in Moscow and they just used him to put it across because he was influential and he did it very well that story about the things in this he was all over the world a lot of people believed in it for this but of course park is done for now that doesn't matter to them they do that to people\nHe was just wanting to lay a foundation you see signs saying\nThe whole thing is being engineered by the Russians like from the beginning of calls quite a long time ago now they had their first try with the flying saucers but that didn't come off because most people didn't believe in them so this time they improved it says they sent\nOut the red balloons things to puzzle people then there was all this business about things down on the sea bought some stock to book\nWas too powerful people then there was all this business about things down on the ... some of the stuff to bark I helped to spread and to make that more convincing that cup some cables and even think of you should walk with these new images submarines of this same kind of they use on this Japanese ship\nAnd now they'll just be able to go on thinking ships because once people have seen through this metal fatigue business\nThey'll just say it's being done by the water and as long as people believe that there'll be no popular backing for reprisals against the Russians sell the metal fatigue idea was just to keep people could feel is\nThe government talking dead but that it's the Russians because then they would be the mind that they should take action and they can't afford to do that with all the red influence there is in the world today like if they are fishing they pretend to think it's the talk of things well then they have to pretend that they were doing something about that as well and that's what makes them look pretty severe later on when he sold exploded\n[noise] one of these days I'm likely to discover that my wife is employed by the secret service\nHave role as a public relations men it should be easy for you to\nSee the thing is simply down to earth and this is the government's way out of a sticky dilemma snake and if it's only a Japanese shift is being sunk it's All right for the moment but it won't last long we can't afford to have the Russians getting ready for this kind of thing\nI think too many lives is on a bit sick\nBut I can see a busy time for me months so writing stuff to prove none of our products can possibly suffers from mental for three to four to ... they have to use your product oh I Know that school our competitors will be saying how very good job of victims fired look bad and we don't do the same\nAlso you know just the shipping shows\nIs sinking lower every day that isn't good mind it points to a number of people who aren't satisfied with a metal fatigue or the Russians was explanation whether you are of course not\nSatisfied with the metal fatigue or the Russians explanation whether you know of course not that is the point I'm not the kind of federal who can make a difference in the price of shipping ship as the ones who kind of intellectual if they start to scare\nPeople start counting autism trade blocks down on the metro I hoped when did they I think the bottom and then the on not\nWhat I just matter is if people swing back to thinking there are if they do we only have one hell of a treat\nAnd if you do have to have any money in shipping handled I should take it out and put it into their crops yes\nMm I Know you unfairly being specializing in this thing I'm falling into long have you any solution\nNo I'm certainly do a little we had just in time to catch the news broadcast antennas down\nIn a very brief

standing by with the latest updates on the forecast you know what I was thinking about\nYou know it's amazing you know every once in a while I get to talk to a different a different variety of people John Sebastian and that would be that would be awesome you know I've I've talked to many many famous people er during my career in radio and television\nUm you know as I was a as I as you know I worked for him on cable and Comcast for twenty five years you know and interviewed the likes of like buffalo Bob Smith and a few other people that uh you know can't think of all offhand but\nAh to talk to a hopefully to talk to John Sebastian and talking about his career\nAh talk to a hopefully to talk to John Sebastian and talking about his career with a weapon spoonful and then\nKind of rescinded his um our ... and I should say his career in the early Nineteen seventies when he uh he sang theme song or a welcome back Kotter he sang that song as well in Nineteen Seventy two\nAh so ... you know possibly a talk about that at some point next month\nRight now Jim has the latest updates force on the forecast sign this Thursday morning gym\nWell Dharma that would be good if you get your on Sebastian and that would be super into talking about increasing things going up well we've got the chances of rain going up but not until this afternoon really outside of a sprinkler in touch with this this morning it's really this afternoon\nAnd tonight that we get into the er showers and downpours we are in a flash flood watch by the way the kicks in eleven o'clock and again that's mainly for the combination of the rain not that we have a major event coming up but because\nUh we've had so much rain over the last couple of months at the water tables are running high so if you have an area that you know when every time it rains we talk about this all the time uh that has big puddles or sometimes it's a little stream it always seems to run kind of high when there's heavy rain that could be the case later this afternoon and tonight I today the low seventies\nFalling back to sixty tonight and then tomorrow early in the days of rain now will watch this the lingering effects of Michael\nIt'll be still a strong extra tropical storm passing southeast of ... tomorrow morning so yeah it's got to be about probably about a hundred and fifty miles from the album area here we are talking about it and seeing it yesterday in Florida and it will make a about a hundred and fifty mile close pass to\nThis area of I'd say around mid morning tomorrow then it moves out that's when the north west wins takeover\nDrier southern clouds tomorrow afternoon again low sixties a noticeable change as the day goes on tomorrow again as I said the high temperature tomorrow is likely to be late morning and then in the afternoon it'll be falling back to the ...\nHigh temperature tomorrow is likely to be late morning and then in the afternoon will be falling back to the fifties down in the forties tomorrow night and then some sun and clouds\nA wake up level feature going through this is more of a cold air aloft situation so it wouldn't be a lot of accumulation in other words of rainfall with it but just a one or two showers scattered through about mid day Saturday other that low fifties and then as we go into Sunday I'd say Sunday is the ... day of the weekend\nIn terms of having almost one hundred percent of the possible sunshine so right now you have a choice of what they do I want to enjoy for the weekend Saturday or Sunday I Would say Sunday is probably the better one because it may be just a shade mild or in the afternoon I'm going for about fifty seven or so on Sunday a\nPerson's fifty two on Saturday and also the negative might be the cold start in the morning but that'll be right at sunrise so again a not a bad weekend coming up typical mid October now as we get into the next two days that October\nSun bowl of iCloud with showers late on Monday they'll showers will linger into early Tuesday and then suddenly clouds back to the low fifties Tuesday so we'd like to talk about what days of similar over the coming I Would say\nIn terms of the temperatures Saturday and Tuesday Tuesday we back into the low fifties and I still think we have our first shot at some point\nAfter Tuesday Wednesday Thursday or perhaps the following weekend of seeing our first threat at a frost\nSo that is something that will monitor and again or not doesn't worry everyone but there are a lot of people out there that are have a plan so they wonder how long can be a certain gardens grow a wasn't there something how long does your guard merry merry quake when prairie dawn when there's something like that\nYes he was Mary Mary ... how does your garden grow right\nThere you go [laughter] anyway uh that might be the issue next week but how long can our gardens continue to produce maybe certain vegetables it might be done by later next week in the ...\nYou continue to produce maybe certain vegetables it might be done by later next week in the tropics of course we have Michael is now moved into South Carolina the center of it a fifty mile an hour winds are the strongest wins on the east side is going to be near Norfolk, Virginia this evening\nAnd then move out north east or south of New England tomorrow so again it's a lot of these storms that moved along that's about the only good thing about it you might have noticed as bad\nAs it was yesterday afternoon down in Florida if you saw a video of it with some of the stations were covering it live\nUh within about two or three hours the worst of it was pretty much gone now that was different from Florence Florence was barely moving this one as was going through that area was moving about Fifteen sixteen Seventeen miles an hour so just think of it if you're on a road it drew in your car driving steadily but\nYou're not fast but not slow either it was moving through that area about sixteen Seventeen miles an hour so it was just going slowly through the neighborhoods but steadily\nFlorence was moving about two miles an hour to snails pay so that is that there is one good thing about it uh it's in and out and just to be the worst of it is about three or four hours now or in the Carolinas they're going to get hammered today because they're still recovering from Florence down there so the issue there will be some trees coming down\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to W.

January two thousand fifty my very first time filling in the subject of tattoos came up with a with Jay Rogers who was running the board and then the subject of those 'cause 'cause tattoos have fads\nOr you had the tramp stamp that lady's we're getting for a long time right there in the lower back\nAnd again like closed tattoos have fads but like close you can change them tattoos are permitted and then there was a for a while guys were getting barbed wire tattoos along their bulging biceps [noise]\nI don't I wouldn't get barb wire tattoo for two reasons one I Am anti doping\nI don't I wouldn't get a barbed wire tattoo for two reasons one I\nHave to I don't believe in tattoos for me do you want to for you that's fine and to my biceps doesn't bode you enough to make the barbed wire tapped to look good but the subject of barbed wire tattoos came up and um yeah this is from January night two thousand and Fifteen\nUm and I think this was the first time that I talked about\nThe old neighborhood the old Harvey lane neighborhood right here on this uh Thirteen twenty am frequency just two minutes into Eighteen seconds are here we go to David catalogue as you move to our neighborhood and fifth grade learn now behind Harvey lane was embraced farm mhm\nSo whenever ... any any any new kid would come to the neighborhood and you know we'd go over and we farm\nAnd then convince them that the cows would attack them okay cows could care less about us\nBut we would convince them to the cows would attack them because that's what that's what young boys do yeah new kid comes to the neighborhood you immediately established the pecking order you're on the bottom and so you try to find a way to scare the heck out of them yeah I Know it's not right ladies but that's what young men do so that reminds me of something from my second grade year All right we'll get to that and yeah\nSo there was an old old rusty barb\nWire fence Neal that separated the yards and Harvey Elaine ... from Emory pharmacies farm property but it was old\nAnd rested and blended in with the trees and stone wall so you couldn't really see it unless you knew it\nThere right so we convince Dave ... is that the cows are going to attack us and by complete coincidence one of the cows turns towards this [laughter] and de thinks they're coming after us well here's where we learned\nThat this new kid was faster than any of us [laughter] you could fly mhm Dave takes off and we see what's gonna happen so we start yelling telling her to stop or slow down we're only kidding\nAnd we see what's gonna happen so we start yelling telling him to stop or slow down we're only kidding but ... thinks the cows going to attack of and so he is running I mean full sprint any hits the barbed wire\nOh white across his stomach ah and I mean right out of the cartoons she spends completely over the barbed wire yeah so that has flown back the other way it landed his back whoa until this day they catalogs he has three little pockmarked you know I was abducted from where he hit the barbed wire\nHis first week in the new neighborhood at Harvey when a man and just show you what a great guy Davis to this day yeah he for it gave us\nWow yeah [laughter] yeah but that was so that was a that was a prank on horribly wrong\nYeah man yeah barb wire well he's so he's got\nSo little what if it was he's the only person I Know who has a real barbed wire cat to run [laughter] well I guess he doesn't have a tennis no God yeah come on and he's never had iron poor blood can imagine [laughter] a while\nThere is January Ninety two thousand and Fifteen or you think that would have been enough to disqualify me but shortly after that I became the main filling guy then got a Saturday show\nAnd then the um the weekdays show which you hear now yeah hey but um there's more a tattoo news we can't stress enough\nHow important it is to make sure that you have a tattoo artist who is literate can translate different light and can translate different languages properly\nTurkish Instagram model not as me law so again I I don't I literally I've never seen any I don't even know what Instagram is don't know what it is don't know how it works in this country so I Know nothing about Turkish Instagram and I sure as heck never heard of Turkish Instagram model\nJosh Instagram and I sure as heck never heard of Turkish Instagram model now has me love\n[noise] um yeah I didn't pick the right tattoo artist and learned that lesson the hard way what she wanted\nTo get a tattoo that said only God can judge my mistakes and truth that's what the tattoo would say stop judging me you know like my music drop dead\nGod can judge my mistakes and truth a well known phrase in the country what she ended up with was I can judge a single God with my rights and wrongs\nOkay she wanted only God can judge my mistakes and truth she caught I can judge a single God with my wrongs and wrongs a single God with my wrongs and wrongs now\nWhere was the tattoo 'cause if it's like on your arm or a leg or somewhere you can see it wouldn't you catch it on pretty quickly no no no that's that's not what I wanted\nNow was this tattoo on our back side or you know the shoulder blade that's a big cool thing now the tattoos and the shoulder blade tattoos in the capital so we're kind of going away um\nBy the way I just thought about Groucho Marx Lydia Lydia not encyclopedia Lydia that tattooed lady when her mom also start contract and uh the hill comes Andrew Jackson anyway so she wanted I'm\nOnly God can judge my mistakes and truce ended up with I can judge a single God with my wrongs and wrongs [noise] needless to say the ...\nWith my wrongs and wrongs [noise] needless to say the inter Web has been having a good laugh at her expense and by the way the ink oh here we go goes all the way from the side of her chest down her hip to just above the knee\nShe was kind enough to post a picture of the work alongside the tattoo artist east where it was quickly ripped apart by her followers wow through times [noise]\nSo uh if you got to go to a tattoo artist you might pick one that speaks the same language or as you\nAnd uh and there it is a viable way to to to one three to zero the number five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty is alert now they're um I I think a body paint you

thing went from a hundred and fifty miles an hour yesterday afternoon it's now down to fifty miles an hour and it was actually fifty early this morning\nSo in less than Eighteen hours went from a hundred and fifty to fifty part of that of course\nAre the main reason really is it's going over the land that doesn't like once that warm ocean water and so uh outside of ah some lakes and ponds in the southeast United States and even some mountains down there and parts of ... ah Georgia South Carolina where it is now have we can however tornadoes\nThe issue right now it's very just to the west of the lovely Columbia South Carolina that's where the center is right now it's going to be around a Charlotte about two hours yeah this is the center of bringing us up because it's going to be not that far away from us tomorrow\nIt's going to make a nice run at a Norfolk, Virginia I'm the same thing and then it's going to go back out over the water and pass about a hundred fifty miles to the south southeast of the ... area about twelve right about this time tomorrow just maybe around\nTwelve o'clock twelve am tomorrow\nAnd then move out into the uh south of Nova Scotia tomorrow night\nSo I can I interrupt for one second yes you're calling this the bad breath of uh weather cycles\nNo bad breath of humidity that's why it's so humid I wouldn't have all these storms\nOkay well I just want to say I'm for obvious reasons I uh I always have a a little ten of al toyed with me if that would help\nObvious reasons I uh I always have a a little ten of al toyed with me if that would help [laughter] I can throw you out towards that way you know I\nKnew that we could have thrown a few of those into the center of this storm and maybe we can do it but ah but no but seriously you're very humid and what's going to happen or the we've had a couple of spots little light showers early this morning\nSo far but most of the action is after about one o'clock afternoon the first batch now is coming through the Bridgeport New Haven area in Connecticut now this is associated with a front not the storm or but on the front is a really potent one and it's going to generate some downpours and again a lot of this would have been less\nHeavy had it weren't for the influx of this a very humid here on the head of the hurricane\nWhich will be racing northeast when it's passing by two are south east tomorrow Paul it's going to be moving around fifty miles an hour so again that is fortunate or because that is what we get in our bad case a hurricane here accelerated storms this one fortunately\nHas been overland now for a while so a lot weaker and it won't hit us directly so rain showers this afternoon tonight or some downpours ... our under a flash flood watch by the weather service one town over Norton\nAnd uh they put it out kicks in in the next hour that's because not only will we have some downpours this isn't going to be a big rain event but the fact that we have a very high water table from recent rains over the last few weeks so that's why a ordinarily the amount of rain and we're asking how much rain or anywhere from one to two inches by tomorrow morning\nAcross much of the area the heaviest amounts would be down along the south coast because they will get a second batch\nEnhanced by uh the tropical storm now at that time it all the extra tropical so purely who will get the actual range from Michael probably Martha's Vineyard a Chatham\nNantucket the rest of us will get an influx of its moisture combined with the front bottom line still on schedule Paul for ring early tomorrow morning especially from Adel borough south and east\nOn schedule Paul for rain early tomorrow morning especially from Adel barrel south and east and then suddenly clouds gusty winds out of the northwest\nTomorrow afternoon up near thirty miles an hour for a few hours with what maybe are starting to die down towards sunset which is good for the football yeah it'll still be a pretty good so good breeze I'd sell even twenty miles an hour out of the northwest\nUh but the temperatures will be falling low seventies today sixty five warning tomorrow that's still way above average but it's not going to go up much in fact it's going to start to fall tomorrow afternoon into the fifties\nSetting the stage for the coolest weekend so far this season not a surprise us each week passes we should be getting cooler hot yet there's a high on Saturday a fifty\nTwo fifty to sixty two\nAfter starting out about forty five which is average Saturday morning again Saturday could have a quick passing shower\nAnd upper level features swinging crew so Saturday is somewhat less\nFunny your other two weekend days although there will be some on Sunday bright sunshine that means the clear morning and that means or the coldest warning of the season so five thirty eight is what I'm now going for on an average on Sunday Morning thirty eight and then a recovery robo fifty six ah on Sunday afternoon all\nBig games going on this weekend for the pros the weather should cooperate for the baseball game Saturday evening at Fenway Sunday evening at Fenway the colder

anything after that yeah it's a lot like um Harper Lee kind of the same deal like to like the greatest uh twentieth century author is kind of just wrote a little bit and then stopped and uh I think the blame reclusive and then feel like didn't want any attention\nYeah I think with JD Salinger and I'm probably wrong on that I Know with Harper Lee that their books were so successful but so misinterpreted they said screw that and then Harper Lee um they came up with at once the Watchmen or something the first book she wrote about a Atticus Finch\nIt's actually well you suddenly the further you get that right that that was like a prequel no it was so uh\nSuddenly the further you get that right that that was like a prequel no it was so odd to kill a mocking bird basically like the ... of that yeah and so it was that was rejected visiting with yes she wrote a book\n\nAbout the real Atticus Finch and about the real south you know nobody would publish it she writes this sanitized fantasy version and it's a huge hit\nAnd then it's like well screw that and she went but anyway back to JD Salinger um yeah he was a real real real wrecked loose and against selling I we weren't on

out here when this guy is he's a road and you know he he he's a liar and he's a see he's a criminal he he's a he's a scam artist and he and he's a danger to society\nAnd and the fact that this took place in in more than likely that the money that was used to to build this company was money that was paid to him by our government\nI mean this is ridiculous because of because he's an asset to our government and he's bringing them manufactured cases of terrorism or this is why he's allowed to continue to stay in this country and to flourish and to run these illegal businesses and which he's constantly cutting corners and and and\n[noise] none of these brothers got jobs on the street of us who don't know your trip but actually we should we humans during Lucia ... pocketbook probably do is

our as well as to um pastors fine so talk about that and defending your clients and how they ended up in jail because\nThese are such Danny not so much of your clients they're clearly desperate and sometimes trying to get away from him he's coming up with a plot all the time he shows the synagogue she shows them a military base\nSo in the case here there were a lot of different ways we're ... we're compressed in time in a sense because it starts in um early two thousand and eight and it goes all the way the two thousand nine nine months of recruitment\nAnd during this time a group of people are leaving to keep walking away they can't find people my client comes in the first time he appears on tape anywhere he says to shed by the way thanks for the job I really do the job\nThat they're very I'm here to do damage to the world a new job\nI mean literally weeks on the street so this persistent\nI Need a job\nAnd I mean literally wasted on the street so this persistence is what ultimately the FBI is allowed to use to say let's compress it all into one moment what do we have we have people saying and clips I'm here for the job\nWhat the trial was about was pulling back that that band aid that that bandage that hides the actual wounds and the woman's wish I had the same doing whatever he wanted to do and that's the connection with the case here today it's not because he was an informant then and live then\nThat he somehow legally responsible for this it's because every day of his life and every minute he's ever had\nHe's had no responsibilities for anything\nSo he comes in he lies about his immigration and I was application for asylum never punished\nHe comes here and he creates a fraudulent business never punished he comes here and he does a bribery scandal at the DMV and he's never punished comes here in the lives of the trial up in Albany never punished becomes really files bankruptcy for lives and its bankruptcy application never punished comes your trial\nAnd for this whole case here lies and every step of the trial exceeds is authority makes offers binds the FBI to things never punished at trial he lives on the stand McMahon turns the jury and says this man is lying\nNever held accountable for the governments then it says you're doing a great job and the terror case in other cases he's done and now this so the timeline is for all of us to watch this to say he's never been held accountable on his life for anything so what does he learned from that he learns sociopath\nThe ability to say without remorse without any concern without any hesitation or do whatever I Want so if I Want this truck on the road that goes on the road and who says no you may know we're still paying the salary he's making hundreds of thousands of dollars doesn't pay taxes on it\nHe lives and commits felony crime I asked him that he didn't pay taxes on the government's pays the money you mean the FBI and our\nTrial came out that he got sixty six thousand dollars in the year before trial you can pay taxes on that money\nOh in our trial came out that he got sixty six thousand dollars a year before trial to pay taxes on that money\nSo what does he learned he learned to do anything you want to go to Pakistan wherever you who knows if he's actually there when the sun is yours dinner for\nMaybe his son takes the beating for um I don't know when did you leave the house who knows she comes and goes as he pleases have you ever been to JFK and she belonged to get it out of JFK do you think he stands on that long he doesn't\nHe just disappears during a trolley disappeared during the trial came back nobody says we don't we're use the FBI agent handler who's on trial on the stand so she goes to follow them in Pakistan no ice and how do you know he's not actually a terrorist maybe he is the actual terrorists\nThere isn't isn't there a question of who he first came to the United states from Pakistan ... murder charge show\nHe says right we don't even have proof of that but he absolutely said that he was a victim of an unlawful arrest and all these other things we have no proof of that is true in the FBI never offered flu so that was true the only thing we know that the FBI is they said about the foreign the trial\nThey said in a letter in an internal memoranda said we know these guys are totally incapable of an operation with out our informant\nI Want to go to a comments that have been made a statement that's been issued by the unless some groups in the U.S or the Muslim solidarity committee project Saddam and the coalition for civil Frieden issued a statement about her than saying quote the limousine company is the latest heads on this road of calamity\nShy in the sense of debt to justice has not than paid\nThe years spent in prison and the year still to ah for the phone and crimes that has an engineer for the FBI cannot be recovered for the men he put away and the terrible irony of a felon convicted as part of a DMV scan who's now responsible for the faulty operates\nConvicted this part of a DMV scan who's now responsible for the faulty operation of a vehicle that killed twenty innocent people\nIs not lost on us so a lyric ... could you up responded to that and also say of what you would call from her sense test too many uh\nYou said that in fact you thought he was taking a direction from the FBI\nSo one of the things that has always troubled me about Hussein in response to the project slum statement I'm or that she just read is going back to his initial charge which was DMV fraud\nUm you know the FBI always says FBI's argument is that it needs a criminal to catch a criminal but going back to that actual at which was in the I Believe it was in ... in the early two thousand uh my question is why did the FBI choose to hire this individual because that very act\nUm which for which they could've prosecuting him and put him in jail\nIs ultimately what killed these people on the fraud getting vehicles actually in what he was convicted of what he should have been convicted of what the FBI knew that he was doing was helping people to receive driver's licenses illegally and his son in this accident than not have a license to drive the vehicle so am I I\nI have not heard much scrutiny around the FBI 'em to date I've not heard of the bureau make a statement about its informant but I actually question the bureau\nReally and why why they chose to employ this individual after knowing he his capability around the square lyric\nI'm you spoke to the mother of David Williams' one of the new book for I think they're in jail what for twenty five years when she learned if that's terrific car crash that involves the men who ended up getting her son and prison what did she tell you\nElizabeth ... Williams was just horrified um you know she legally she was just wondering like any mother would shift\nProvide 'em you know she ... she was just wondering like any mother would she still trying to get her son out of jail um she understand that in this by you know the injustice occurred so I think her first response was illegal one\nI'm going back to sort of the point that I spoke on um is there any way that the FBI can be held accountable for this man now that it's clear um that the original crime when they hired him is what kill these people all of them at least so she's wondering how this current event\nMight impact our son sharks might impact David I'm freedom\nAnd the last ten seconds your response embrace I'm sure when you heard what happened in ...\nYou know it's more the same for this young men are seen does whatever he wants to do throughout his life and it's not just that there are so she passed among us because there are it's when our government tolerates the sort of craziness\nLike the last story both Scott the governor and Florida will just tolerate the nonsense let's duck ... and harden soon if you harden soon about the environment Heiden said about justice if you're hiring soon about all the issues are important to us why do we think we should be credited and give the bottom line is the the wrap their arms around a lawyer\nAnd here's the IRS would re promote their so\nAnd as Michael German said and a remarkable film or by David how Brunner a the HBO film the ah the Newberg staying quoting Michael German an FBI agent uh after nine one one after nine eleven\nHis colleagues at the FBI were saying you know the rules no longer apply and he was walking around saying what are you talking about\nThe ... or will he says the rules you mean the constitution I actually wish that with my ... he's a good guy to\nSan braver men lawyer for one of the new verb for lyrics ... co director of the award winning documentary Tara which is now on Netflix and we want to thank Khalifa who joined us from the halfway house in Pittsburgh\nBlacks and we want to thank ... who joined us from the halfway house in Pittsburgh we thank you so much a ... a a killing a\nForeign lightning I says we continue to try to find out what had taken place on the roads of upstate New York and wear a\nThat point that she had um Hussein is his son is in jail [noise]\nAnd throughout look the Nixon is that is even to Trump he ran a harsh law and order campaign in Nineteen sixty eight uh he's slash social spending to increase crime uh so uh so Nixon is a good\nWe're going to continue the conversation after the broadcast and we'll post it under ... says that democracy now dead or chase a sandwich ...
