Mansfield is such a great program very well coach at apple\nThey feel is such a great program very well coach it out of ours got to be the absolute best will be returning this kick off almost ready to become\nA stove and has taken the lead back from North out of our all again they lead fourteen to ten with seven minutes to go in the third\nQuarter ...\nStones good football town yeah\nYou know there's always been at least recently in this league Mansfield in North adult borrow in king fill up have been the big three of an adult borrowing stove and have been kind of just trying to knock him out on the door all the time but they've always had five real good programs in this little box ...\nWith a P. A. T. it is good and was eight forty seven to go and the third quarter and he's twenty eight four team in favor of Mansfield adult borrow had the ball first and the second half\nFull mold on their first play and it takes Mansfield five place to travel twenty three yards into the end zone along with the penalty and they have a twenty eight fourteen ... so it's really a thirty two yards once again Paul because you hear me say that solve it\nFourteen leave so it's really a thirty two yards once again Paul because you hear me say that it's all the\nTime [noise] you've got three kids and you've got to a\nYou've got to maintain a contained that's a I used to call it can you have and they\nConsistently that's been a problem ... right now and the only way you can maintain contain it stay square the line of scrimmage and make sure that you've taken away the the the boundary yeah\nYou can't you can't give up contain and it's been a problem all might [noise]\nAnd so that means in this with that thirty one yards they gained right there in Fort carries they've now had twenty carries for a hundred and fifty five yards a sovereign state yards a crack\nStole ten Twenty one north adult borrow ten three minutes to go in the third quarter sounds like an interception for a touchdown and to me\nMaybe not you know but no I mean\nAll right to scores down it's time for head over to play the ... it's

running behind the left guard duty out and the left tackle clean Charles he gains three yards it will be second and\nSeven that certainly makes third carry but with the reception he's made he's really been very effective yup [noise]\nAnd they need to run that full black to set up the option they've got to respect that die for sure\nBut it's interesting 'cause on three occasions against all of our brains Jason we're used that late pitch yes and the ... once again you're playing against the team right here that knows assignment football\nYou reach keys [noise]\nForman front\nCamera and the ... comes in motion they give distracting again that time he ran up right they stand them up one of the reason he ran I watch them forward any games two or three more yard ... there was a little exchange\nProblem I thought okay I thought the ball was on his back hip and the defensive tackle I think that was ... almost ... rip the ball out and that would have been another brutal [noise] just a little bit of an exchange problem they want to hit them inside because the taxes are planning the outside shoulders of the guard yeah\nWhich gives you you know with the center he's got a one on one shot of mental linebacker cushion middle linebacker this good that's not always as easy as it looks\nThat was a a another three are gain is gonna be third and\nFour and a by the way that wasn't Walker that was Jack McCoy defensively they're okay and it was a real nice play ball at the thirty one their own thirty one\nCamera incomes emotion left to right eye formation behind the quarterback they do

basketball\n[laughter] I don't borrow at their own forty seven first and ten ... with the wide receiver to the right to sophomore Daniels out to the left they faked a toss rolling right is we're throws ooh he bought high striking and takes a huge hit after the ball and gone by by Joe Plath\nRight in the teeth that was a helmet white to the teeth of Mike's tracking pops up he's tough\nKit wow and that was one of those plays the race than it was thrown like that is Jason realized he was not opened yet he almost threw a bullet a knee high behind yeah and of course Mike tried to catch it which really led to a very bad and second and ten now for the blue wall but here's\nMy Carol just texted us to say hello Mike and Paul [noise] hello Carol ... eleventh uh sixteen now for a hundred and Seventy hours for Jason where\nStruck out wide right now they throw underneath to Cody trying to get him the ball he makes the catch but only games three yards 'cause Vinnie Holmes's there without another attack for the Mansfield hornets\nThird and seven well I guess he's not dropping too deep anymore and fight it outside linebacker [laughter]\nThird and seven of the blue volunteers at the plus forty nine forty nine of Mansfield [noise]\nThis is not for the territory much ...\nThis is not for the territory much as you'd like to be because you any team can make a mistake dethrone target or but boy this great past protection is really cause great presence of mind by and large we're it's been terrific\nDraw three wide out to the left they draw with Cody oh pity outside on the right side of the yard line still in his feet at the twenty to outline what a great run by Justin ... twenty six yards gained draw running behind Puerto Rican and evidence then cut it outside\nThey thought he was going to go out of bounds at the thirty Mike He cut back in and got nine more yards he is so scrappy\nSo tough minded great instincts and there was a counter draw where he gets the quarterback paid staff to go to his left slipped into Cody flew back to his right made a great dip moved around the corner yeah instead of a drop in the middle and then he raised to the boundary cut it back inside twenty six jarred\nStriking is now in the backfield at full back Cody the slot laughs slot right is Cameron Cameron comes in motion to the last option left pitched a camera in schools to attack the backfield and then under the ground by T. J. guy I'm Glad for them to have you tried yard exactly how far we threw him\nSo that's where the rain gauge three arts cameras just caught on camera number five four they're doing some interesting stuff that they aren't they pull it really are that's when the slot back counter there or power you know I don't want them give them the ball ... anymore yeah other than that I like it all\nOut of or is that the twenty again it would have been no game but guy threw him forward three great cut made by camera yeah I mean it was just a beautiful cut because the corner to come up and he just take them out of his jock went back inside of Cody comes in\nCut because the corner to come up and he just take them out of his jock went back inside of\n... comes in motion left they picked the option now a swing faster Cody on the right cuts inside breaks a tackle stays on his feet and going lo and making a nice hit was Plath what he didn't wrap\nSo instead of a loss for\nCody it's no gain and will be thirty seven was passed ... lateral or pass [noise]\nYeah they gave me a yard but I think that was a lot of I think there's a lateral to I'm going to give them a a run on that\nOnce again put on

really in the fifties style defense right now with big Eddie over the center of defensive tackle or what they call and right now place in the outside shoulder tackle as Nick Evans [noise]\nThat was a delay of game against Mansfield that's ... yeah\nWell once again it didn't seem to me what happened was they start at the clock running when they are the stakes are set okay and Mike writing like a jazz you used to west pro which drove me crazy often will bring the quarter back over to counsel them a little yeah\nGiven the fact you're the third string quarterback who's never played quarterback is light that feel that sort of a senior in high school I get it [noise] we needed that\nYeah there's little wink T look where they fought on the left right wing comes in motion let Hamas on his left over here in the corner he gets to the edge cuts back inside goes back outside forced out by the Iranian and coach he\nSays emotion because the motion when one of the wings just flies by the quarterback yeah and that's often if it's short motion they'll handle the ball and all that speed sweep well when he does that the ... you have to rotate up\nAnd meet him and of course ... is in pre rotating up and he got six yards\nSecond down and all nine to go was that whose car carry that Christian caught or twenty nine what's happened is a sincere guild\nNot sure that he's been playing a lot of wing and slot but not getting the\nWhat's happened is a sincere guild I'm not sure that he's been playing a lot of wing and slot but not getting the ball a lot I mean he was phenomenal and the first half yup so Mansfield is that the\nWhat twenty nine of adult world twenty eight\nAnd once again they get this odd backfield formation\nShotgun quarterback back behind him back to his right they

Stevens who was kind enough to come in the [laughter]\nI was gonna say the office [laughter] the radio station today at seven AM he is my first guest and we're going to be talking to him about the city of Arab Berlin also nationally we want you to be safer about identity theft latest scams in the area and a nationally and I've got a few here\nThat I found very interesting and that we've got Jim Corbin calling in at seven Fifteen\nAnd again at age ... and then had this going to call in a little later around eight thirty and then we also have um\n[noise] and the eight o'clock hour we have Paul Jake's from the real fires\nFires firefighters who is going to be talking to us about a really great community event that's happening today at eleven o'clock in the\nI'm at a real fire station in a sense out of our all of the I guess it's on west ... street so he'll be in and talking to us about fire safety too and um I found a lot of things about on Halloween safety and different things to\nShow a well I'd like to welcome you all this morning anyway boy it was forty degrees when I got up this morning and I walk\nAnd I I walked out and it was dark so I got to ask Jim carbon what's that all about I Know change of the season I get that\nBut I Know like in a few weeks we're going to be turning the clocks back and that's where even going to make it much more darker and um and then to kind of feel like a\nA groundhog I guess 'cause you're waking up in the dark and you're coming home you know at five o'clock and it's dark outside and oh man everybody just like\nCamp oh it's just as for me it's like I Love summer I Love fall but this time of year it's kind of like oh man but I like the cool nights that's for sure and I finally took out my air conditioning unit so I think we're in pretty good shape anyway I'd like to welcome you well to the show and I like\nSo I think we're in pretty good shape anyway I'd like to welcome you well to the show and I'd like to welcome Anthony are so good morning and thank you for coming on this or only oh You're welcome willing to keep Robin Williams one\nUm there's been a lot of um international and national scams that I'd like to uh and there's actually a it's a it's a website called scam lines I guess and um so here's a here's the thing and uh it says say no to a star Seventy two\nOkay so here here's what happened in Sioux Falls South Dakota a man tells\nA man calls and says that ah there's something happening to your family member they died and us a call here's the cell phone number and star seven too and so what happens is the person calls back that number and what it actually does it transfers all your call center the cell phone number and the caller\nThat the caller has given and the cameras on number so the cameras\nThat can give his buddies in anywhere in the world your phone number via your cell phone and you're picking up the charges\nSo they said don't you start seven to a cause that's a ... code and I'm so just be careful\nAnd another scam is a state wide warning and Utah this month when a familiar trip where individuals get calls telling them they feel to turn to for jury duty\nAnd um but you can cancel your warrant or you have to do is just you know give them your credit card number and um and pay a fine ... ... and this one here I I'm not laughing but don't pay the hit man that says\nA a rash of death threat emails have um victims of grand falls North Dakota trembling in their shoes a message warning about six hundred and fifty thousand dollar contract killing\nThe trembling in their shoes a message warning of us six hundred and fifty thousand dollar contract killing and you're the target unless you pay the hitman Fifteen thousand dollars they say because you're being watched you can't contact the police and you have to have you have to give them the money within twenty four hours [noise]\nLook let's be serious are we really worth six hundred and fifty thousand dollars so it is a scam I'm Sorry this is a scam so don't fall for that\nBut um there's another one and then I'll I'll get into Anthony's interview 'cause I really do want to talk to him about the local stuff but in Garland, Texas a couple of swindlers posing as water company officials invite themselves into a private home to check out the water supply fixtures telling the victims they need to buy water purifiers which\nThe scam is of course just happened to have in stock the defective\nThey don't work for the for the company so they're just saying you know just to be careful\nAnd um and one more which is really bad um you know there's a lot of people that post furniture or the other things on Craig's list so like say for guys raising money for a terminally ill pay a parent trying to sell furniture trying to sell anything and the buyer\nSays hey\nI'll send a check but it's way too much money so with the seller mind cashing my check and send them back the difference\nSo it's kind of like an over payment skiing and Anthony shaking has yes so here's the thing never accepted checks for more than the asking price of the article and then give a refund because the original checked usually balances\nAnd then you end up holding the bag so\nGood morning my friend [laughter] I tell you with this job and learn something new every day but the star Seventy two because we were talking about I\nWith this job and learn something new every day that the star Seventy two and I think is what we're talking about I\nThat's a new one so I'm this but the scary part of that is you don't even know until after the fact like I I wouldn't you know if you hit star Seventy two and your calls are coming forward and like how would you even know that they're forty your calls until after the fraudulent activity come starts to come and\nUm and by that point there's there could be a lot of damage done um it's interesting because I I just I was reading in bed last night and I I wanted just to kind of ... to share this there was a an article in the Washington Post the other day\nThe FCC actually reported reports that there are approximately um it's a two thousand sixteen estimate but there's two point four billion unwanted automated calls every month and I'm like holy cow [noise]\nBut what's really interesting about the article um you can look it up on line I think was we think it was published yesterday to tape for [noise] um [noise]\nCloser to the center of that storm I say that because not only do we have a high water table\nBeen closer to the center of that storm I say that because not only do we have a high water table and the really uh it's really looking good as we go into the through the fall in terms of worries about low waters and our ponds and lakes you might have noticed I talk about this with you last week in LA and even weeks the last few weeks\nWe've had a really healthy dose of rain over the last month and a half a and a yesterday was another case in point\nThe shower threat we get today is going to be minor compared to that so you will be dodging\nOr some of the raindrops between again roughly ten in one now that could be a light shower before ten\nAnd once again maybe just after one o'clock but it's not really what we call the cold air aloft situation so there's not a lot of moisture to squeeze out so enough to cause a a wedding of the ground or during the farmers' market but again nothing no strong winds no lightning as I like to say always just going to be on the cool side so\nUh the first time so far this season that we've had a bit of rain with the temperature that cool about fifty degrees now here's the story tonight we're actually going to have a very nice mid to late afternoon sun starts coming up brightly again but that will set the stage or you were talking about Elaine how dark it was this morning\nSix fifty for\nA I should say six fifty five or was the sunrise this morning which obviously we didn't see it with the clouds around\nUh but uh the sunset will be at six o five today six o five about what that means is\nThat it's going to quickly cool off right after sunset which again now it's closing in again on six o'clock and we will see the coolest morning of the season so far yet again it seems like we've have having these on Sundays lately or just by the lack of of things thirty\nEight you thought forty eight a link to this morning was called thirty eight tomorrow morning now fortunately it's a Sunday Morning many people might not have to get out early but\nThirty eight tomorrow morning and back to a recovery of fifty a tomorrow afternoon so what do you think about\nMorning and back to recovery of fifty a tomorrow afternoon so what do you think about that\nThat is a reasonable I cannot believe that we have finally getting into the fall weather I mean I like cool night here now and it's great they're nine thirty eight degrees oh my God I Know\nAnd there's actually a frost advisory because those North West of here a nearby southern Chester county now I don't think we'll see any frost or in this area but it's going to come close so if you're someone who lives are typically a in a more rural location say in the uh places such as a northern Rhode Island or even\nA you know some of the rural parts of plane bill and\nAh eastern are taught in\nThose areas might get down as low as thirty five or thirty six tomorrow morning let's we'll be right at sunrise so if you have still some plants ... you're trying to keep growing because this time of year it's mostly the ones you have to worry about late fees and vegetables\nOr you might want to just kind of keep an eye on things but I don't think there'll be quite cold enough for that now here we go Monday stop and do we wouldn't you know we started out sunshine on Monday morning\nAnd then we'll cloud up we'll have another episode of a few light rain showers\nMonday afternoon into early Monday evening\nOr that one good once again not to be too bothersome I mentioned that's about the string of rain we've had over the last couple of months the water tables are running really high so as soon as I was trying to say before as we go through the fall season\nUh we're adequate above average with rain that's why you some of the ponds and lakes if you see around the area the Manchester reservoir an adult borough is running above average per height which is good because it means that uh it's better to be above average is law does not flooding\nSo ... reservoir just a couple of miles up the street from where I Am a the reservoirs they were doing a lot of nice fishing there yesterday so again it's really a good if you like to do some fall fishing or where it's allowed a the fishing is really good because we've had this adequate water once again I bring it up because we could use a break from getting sick\nWe have this adequate water once again I bring it up because we could use a break from getting some of these heavy rain events and it looks like this upcoming week we will the shower threat today is minor again meeting maybe a tenth of an inch or less the shower threat to a Monday afternoon is minor maybe one or two tenths of an inch or less\nCompare that to the two to three inches of rain that we had a two days ago and the ... yesterday morning so it's a good situation for that now as we go into the middle of next week yet in stages yet another cold air masses moves in and guess what we're going to be talking about actually gets a two word term lame\nW and see what do you think that is\nWet snow W and\nSee oh she was a guy [laughter]\nThat's all right I'm not a I'm Sorry I'm not paying attention I'm Sorry that's okay [laughter] I feel like All right so it's a way way way way down\nOr whether it's a weather term but first we were as four letter starts with a double oh Jim ... has ... you'll get it no I well I think\nIt just\nI I didn't get my sleep last night but that is often [laughter] more\nSipping coffee there and then you know but the wind chill Winfield [laughter] we had known as the wind chill essentially for this time of year actually an unusual\n[laughter] see he's thinking I Would have got that if I had a couple of more simpler that\nCoffee no I wouldn't have known that yes I Am that [laughter]\nAll right well I Know I get this Wednesday and especially Thursday morning this long range obviously next week we could be looking at Thursday morning when children the twenties [laughter] so that is really not unusual it's just that it's been so warm lately over the last few weeks and that is going to seem\nWorse so uh if you if you like the real one we've had lately like Wednesdays eighty two degrees or you can\nUh if you if you like the real one we've had lately like Wednesdays ... eighty two degrees or you can say goodbye to that probably for the rest of the year\n... no kidding said it's time to turn on the heat\nYeah I still have not yet turned the heat on in in in the Fifteen Years I've been at this location I have never not turned my heat on so late into the season right and it's almost like it's like a game you want to see how far you can go without doing it all out tonight tonight with the winds fairly light\nOr you probably will be All right if you just have your windows closed a lot I say that because\nWhen kills next week\nA means you're probably going to definitely if you haven't if you don't turn the heat on tonight's cold because there's no when a when you close the windows next Thursday a I think most people will finally give it up and say I I bet it turned it on\nOh wow what about the hurricanes that Michael had come to the coast and I'm here I Know my family and they actually had an incident where they had high winds knocking down trees and the power is out and it scares the yeah\nThat storm obviously it was so strong a hundred and fifty miles an hour but it because it was so strong when it hit the panhandle of Florida obviously devastation there\nOr it just takes it took a while to spin down even though it was a you know overland by the time it reached Virginia um earlier yesterday and the night before a it's still headwinds of sixty five and Seventy miles an hour so I mean think about it went from a hundred and fifty\nTo sixty or sixty five Seventy that's a big drop off\nIt's still bad because we started out at a hundred and fifty so and of course that's what a moved off the coast yesterday morning luckily we we were on the ah least wind side but that rail yard yesterday morning that was from Michael or as it moved off the coast than it believe it or not it's it's headed for\nA south of Iceland right now it's actually racing to the northeast at about sixty miles an hour so it's out of here but yeah so are we ... let's put it this\nAnd about sixty miles an hour so it's out of here but yeah so uh we're ... let's put it this way all end all in all end all this and they'll have one more quick update it eight o'clock or we could tone down the heavy rain events that we've had over the last five or six weeks\nWere adequate as I said the ponds and legs to find a everything is delayed this year that's why if you're looking around you're saying wow it's the thirteenth of October\nSaturday morning I'm looking around and there's not much color on the leads right there are those the maple trees those the ones that have the reds they are always early every year already some of the leaves have dropped off of those but almost every other tree in the greater out of our area is still mostly green\nBecause it's been so unusually warm or this or worse the late summer and then the fall season and the case in point the aid to we got on Wednesday so what you're gonna see over the coming days is an increase in the colors on the leaves\nAre brown yeah I notice like how I found out about this come as a maple trees just starting to turn red and orange alert or whatever you have one\nOr whatever you have those trees that or even even ... like earlier than today that already every year the you always we always have that tree or two in the neighborhood that you look at it every year and you say wow that always turns like color real early in the middle east just fall off ... those are usually the those are usually the maples\nSometimes just because they have strangled roots that they might not be in a good location you sometimes see that on the uh in the on the mediums of highways you'll see some nice stretches of color early ah ah I Know there's a lot of those long stretches of root for Ninety five\nAnd a and also one Ninety five a sections through C. C. conference one day where all of a sudden you'll be driving on the highway and there's like a mile of just unbelievably bright color and a lot of those have to do with how the roots of growing but ah yeah it's everything is late that's why I said you last week lay these you know the Columbus Day weekend\nWas last week at officially right and yeah yesterday was ... was ... actually the truth Columbus Day white the twelfth\nRight and yeah yesterday was ... was ... actually the truth Columbus Day ... white the twelve years was always the twelfth rainbow or so and this year I think we're going to have ... instead of Columbus Day holiday colors are in much of doing what it's going to be Halloween\nColors as I said last week so we still have everything has delayed that's why when you made the climate it's chilly this morning\nIf we if this had been a normal fall you would have probably if I I Will check it and you said this is a beautiful morning even though it's not funny because you would have already been used the days like this or that we should have had already so in other words it's I'll end on this finally ... nature making up for lost time\nThat's why we put up with a few rain showers a later this morning but a really compared to think about it if you're out of the rain today LA for a couple of for a little bit think of our people down there in the Gulf Coast that got hit by a\nA when we first started this conversation a few minutes ago is that um you know for burglary or for us it's we've seen a decline over the last ten years but just this year alone we've seen a forty five percent drop in burglary wow already burglaries um and again it comes down to you know you know what is one of those reasons that might that might be and\nAgain it comes down to you know you know what is one of those reasons that might that might be\nAnd um it's ... to ... in my opinion is is because because there's other crimes out there so let's say I go to Berkeley break into your house or you know there's there's a high risk of getting caught getting you know somebody may be home may have a gun or maybe dogs\nUm and ... you know what's what's the what's the reward so there's there's a ... you don't know what you're walking into you are you going to walk away with a couple of thousand dollars and jewelry or cash maybe maybe not [noise]\nUm but we know why do that when I can go out and do organized retail theft I can go out and steal tens of thousands\nOf dollars of of health and beauty products you know there's there's a huge black market not only in this country but overseas or they may be shipping stuff out um so I could I could do that get get decent money for things like that or the fraud fraud the as you saw you know sixty two billion dollars um\nIn fraudulent checks last year in two thousand Seventeen so you know there's more there's more money to be made\nAnd you know to be honest I'm\nProperty crimes that really looked at I'm In my opinion again there's not really looked at as far as it should be in this country you know what ... what do we do with these offenders\nUm you know a lot of times they get a slap on the rich from the judicial system I'm just because there's no place to put them in so you know if you come across this hey there's a lot of money to be made and again what's what's the registers low risk of my really going to go to go to jail or the fed you're going to get involved the political it's probably not\nVery I rented a car you buy the stupid criminal [laughter] okay\nThere's a lot out there but I had no interest in this\nActually happened to my friend and I can't identify the town because here in this area to story I'm so folks when you're dealing with the general public it's wise not to leave your hum\nI'm so folks when you're dealing with the general public is wise not to leave your wallet or credit cards exposed or an open back where somebody can go in and take your credit card so here's the story I'm\nJust I'm maybe about nine months ago ... tax season and everything was happening and a tax preparer a friend of mine um\nHad this young man come in and his girlfriend and um she wanted to sit in another Cubans to look over her personal stuff she said she didn't want him to know how much money she cats so we said okay no for no problem so what happened was\nUm this person on and the kid was distracting the tax preparer\nAnd saying well can you make a copy of this for me for my file so when they got up to make the copies\nUm fast forward or four months later um he gets a call from a bank saying that this credit card had been declined in\nA city in Massachusetts and they're out in Hawaii and the person that stole the credit card was from this person's mother who passed away\nSo the person had taken a credit card out of this person's wallet well they were making copies but what what is ironic is the kids stayed had his taxes prepared\nSo the police now have his name Social Security number address and phone number and he tried to use the card\nEight times in one area and one time in another\nSo now they they just recently found out all this information put the case together they seen the video the police were very diligent they got they notified like all the names from this tax preparing office about\nSo I like all the names from this tax preparing office about the timeframe that this person might have come in the approximate age and don't you know that they they found this kid\nAnd I said that's great police work but what a stupid criminal now is stealing a credit card when you think that you would just say okay never mind forget it and leave the kids stay has done\nAnd and then and then had a I'm not\nGoing to say if I had the mirror of having a mirror to actually wait for a month before they actually use the card\nAnd enemies [laughter]\nIt's kind of a mixed bag when you cross and that's good you brought that up site and you know I Want to let people know this too so that something came up um recently ... didn't pertain Adel broke but I found this very interesting and I I wouldn't have thought of of of of it this way but um you know the name of a individual had come up who lives um\nIn the region he he ... he does a lot of car breaks um goes a person gets out always doing heartbreaks\nThis particular gentleman\nOlder gentlemen he's got to be probably mid forties but he's very he's very smart about what what he does and you know this is if you if someone's ever a victim of a corporate this is some some of the things you should think of and again I I Would have never have thought this\nWrench into a car you know we usually unlocked\nUm people a lot of time to see this a lot of people either while in the ... I don't I don't know why they do that but they do yeah but he's very he's very smart but what he does he will if he finds while\nHe will go in and take out one credit card he will leave everything else in the car hoping that no one will notice that they broke into the car like hey you know somebody did break into my carpet my ... year Neal I mean how many of us have multiple credit cards I wouldn't think okay yeah you know like all four or five\nI mean how many of us have multiple credit cards I wouldn't think okay yeah you know like all four or five of my credit cards or whatever it is and then he'll wait several weeks up to like five or six weeks and then he'll go and use the card\nAnd just wrap it up just you know ... you just take him out one card um and then who use it down the road just to see if if if it's still active when somebody didn't actually knows missing\nInteresting enough to hold you there for a break but we'll talk more about this when we come back we're morning

oh here's an update and as\nYou'll be taught as you'll be talking about ... coming up things going on out in the boat you're going to be all about the next one to two hours or in this general area Alvaro Providence taught and we'll socket box for oh you're going to be dodging some raindrops now it's not a heavy events not like yesterday morning\nHowever there will be a few shoppers around so\nAnd they'll continue off and on that is why we call them showers won't be constantly raining but there'll be some brain through about one o'clock or so or the further east you are say you over towards taught and or maybe you're going to be over the ... theory of the kids some of those showers they link to mid afternoon if you're going to be west of here say uh up in northern Rhode Island\nA or a further west other showers could end\nBy around twelve o'clock so depending on where you are but all of us are going to get some showers maybe up to a tenth of an inch of rain which are certainly enough to measure and there'll be maybe some tiny puddles here and there the good news by three o'clock subtlety out again in most areas are and ah\nCertainly we should have a nice sunset just before six o'clock with just after six o'clock actually and that'll set the stage as I said for the first temperatures in the upper thirties that we've had widespread the last time we had temperatures lately okay here's the quest to take a guess\nIs the all the other question will ask a terms of the ... in terms of the weather to take a guess when you think the last time\nA terms of the ... in terms of the weather ... take a guess when you think the last time the temperature in adult borrow and Cindy was right around thirty eight degrees\n... take a wild guess think about it now did you have the coffee\nI have I'm On a salary cap right now let me think [laughter] I mean from\nGood gas out right around April first [noise]\nThank you so that's good yeah I'm actually we uh it's\nBeen about an average or late in his for for a for the thirty so bottom line is it's gonna be cool to ah obviously tonight by the way Red Sox playing at Fenway this evening out a way\nKnow I Know a tribute great game or a should be both both nights tonight and tomorrow for whether it's going to be cool or certainly for baseball standards cool football of course as well or going against the red Sox will be the patriots Gillette Stadium tomorrow evening\nAnd it'll be probably not quite as cool tomorrow evening as this evening\nSo ah but the bottom line is the three big games this week out for the pros the two Red Sox games and the patriots game tomorrow evening no rain to worry about uh it'll be probably both within a few degrees or forty five fifty degrees\nBy the time those games start course they both around eight o'clock in the evening so I certainly want address if your if you don't want to go into the games are no way no snow to worry about it [laughter] it's\nLike a but it will be on the cool side finally back to a average rather than as you were mentioning you actually I forgot to mention a lady I talked about that storm Leslie\nIt is finally going to be on the move after almost four weeks I if you'd only one that's in a believe it or not and then we are a lot of people do know some people are in this area that live in Portugal\nThat storm is finally going to move into Portugal as an extra tropical hurricane tonight to me\nStorm is finally going to move into Portugal as an extra tropical hurricane tonight tomorrow now it's not going to be a major hurricane certainly nothing close to a Michael the other day but a rare hurricane in Portugal\nI actually it's going to move into Spain as a as an extra tropical storm almost like what we had yesterday morning places like the grid is actually going to get some of the uh gusty winds and rain from a Leslie finally decided to move inland after almost four weeks so again I Know a lot of people might know people are Portugal Spain\nOr those areas going to get hit by a rare tropical storm extra tropical really us and its allegedly a tonight and tomorrow and due tomorrow night so I can kind of unusual stuff going on in the tropics\nUh we had two doses of tropical moisture we remember Florence and we always ... we for the most part here reap the benefits number three weeks ago on Monday we had that rainy day\nThe remains of Florence of course that was the bad storm that hit the Carolinas that was a slow moving the flooding was the issue and then of course yesterday morning we reap the benefits in a way filling up our ponds and reservoirs by the terrible hurricane Michael which obviously didn't bring us a lot of strong winds here because we're on the rainy or side\nOf the storm but so I bring this up because as as much as some people might be complaining of times with how the weather's been and all this and that oh we're gonna have a few showers today are again I Know he said this earlier but compared to what's been happening across a lot of other areas we really have not had any significant\nBad weather issues and in fact Elaine the the issue that happened to you know cut two or three weeks ago up in the with the gas explosions up at the end over member that\nYou know yeah Lawrence north\nEnd over that area a air anytime now there's a gas issue anywhere uh everyone's a little school which is understandable but keep in mind as bad as that that was and it still is lingering up there and hopefully it's not going to happen again anywhere in Rhode Island Massachusetts it happened at a time when when\nAnd hopefully it's not going to happen again anywhere in Rhode Island Massachusetts it happened at a time when we're not worry too much about extreme heat or extreme cold\nSo I mean as as I said the off in the last few weeks with is that this issue timing is everything I mean that gas explosion situation happened in the dead of winter when the temperatures below zero or they'd be people that would have no heat\nOr because of gas heat or no power and that happened in the dead of summer in July there'll be people roasting in the heat\nSo what happened at a time where it was a sort of a transitional time of year and in fact the fact that we have not had any extreme cool weather up until tonight\nReally getting I'm sure you'll see this on the news it's really the first ... next week will be for all those people that are still a having issues with or trying to get heat in their house and having to use space heaters I mean think about it if you had to use if you lost your feet in the winter due to a gas explosion or ... or whatever it is electric\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nWow hey everyone morning you're listening to the land that that doesn't like yeah my I don't know well well our number here five oh wait two to two twenty good morning I Am so happy that politicians in ... in the in the house as they say and he's our\nOur local fire fighter um who does a lot of great things for

had mentioned that I wouldn't it be great that if the um if they move up the holiday or something instead of um October thirty for us to have it on the last Saturday of October this way it's Saturday and I'm you know that it would be easier you know\nThe way it's Saturday and I'm you know that it would be easier you know to get out and now I'm Out and about what the kids and and the parents and everything so I don't know I don't think that'll ever happen but um I think you're right I think that\nUm kids have to be aware and also too I Know as a parent I used to inspect all the candy before they ate any of it you\nKnow a good point or as we've seen over the years with some a tragic incidents mhm or some such situations where they can do you want to make sure that I live\nRight now I Know that I'm having a smoke detector and also I um I smoke detector and carbon monoxide monitored do you have to have to or is there some that have both and what's the difference\nYou know there's some that have both this individual ones I'm obviously as a as you get them that way it's going to be you know the cost is going to go up probably on each from Home Depot Lowe's wherever you buy mhm but definitely I'm GM CEO detectors and the smoke detectors in combination\nRight right now um how would we deal with out of ... and how we deal with fire safety\n\nAs far as a part of safety ... as far as I said yeah shouldn't ah well I mean like um when you go out on the\nCall and stuff um what are some of the fires like what are the the main things that you see when you're going out like how to fire star\nNo I mean as with anything in life I mean a lot of fires start with human error or mechanical or um Mm So a lot of things you know just accidents especially in the learned today in the are safe trailer we have a markup kitchen or things about you know making sure you don't leave the stove on\n'em don't put such things like pizza boxes in the oven to woman pizza silly things like\nThat Oh yes yeah so\nUh yeah different just a human error is a lot of it in mechanical era you know things break over time right\nHuman error is a lot of it in mechanical era you know things break overtime right it's like\nWow and how are we doing without a problem with the uh\nYou know like I'm like I Know with Anthony like he comes on every month and we do like crime sets and things like that how was the Arab world for our fires are we are we okay yeah we um do when do you see like a peak in indifference that you have to go out and if I was just at the wintertime because of you know I'm\nFireplace fires or at least burning or is it the summertime\nI say you know it's a ... year round or a situation unfortunately I mean real or you know it's a\nThings happen for accidents for no reason and it's just luck of the draw when things happen they happen you know I'm can be a stretch where there's nothing in the end of a sudden the stress that there is right or it's just a you know there's a lot of you know increased\nTime so that might be a more possibilities of fires ... you know whether it be with candles or in the wintertime I said oh ... starting up their furnaces are which does a good be simple things is that do ah then you have the outside when people do and burning you know they get away from them in a catch things in the woods on fire and also\nHopefully it doesn't spread to a ... a home in the vehicles mhm and you have your situations where mechanical\nBreakdowns vehicle fire so to be on the roads locally or on highways mhm right now there's a lot of\nSituations you never know what was going to happen when you show for each day you know oh I'm sure you know every day's a new day [laughter]\nYeah I I think that would have some of the most interesting calls that you've been on so far in your career path\n\nWhile I made a gun on a most probably twenty three Twenty years now so it\nMe I was catching up or so a lot of things happen to you know to reflect on it I mean if it's not a ... ...\nA lot of things happen to you know to reflect on it I mean if it's ... you know obviously a lot of uh tragedies or whether it be accidents and or or deaths uh when that Holmes buff fires from uh the gas explosion to or lots of let a trying to think of the big ones\nOh no right I'm going to be responding to in different communities around for hunting and then\nI you know\nSo I mean there's a lot of uh you know we have a good group you know we have a a good team of firefighters there and out here now to Berlin uh we stick together and we do our best\nYeah I Do I Want to myself okay stop talking to him [laughter] so I yikes\nYou know so so um yeah\nI don't know you know I think that um doctors have to be educated more about that I think that um and I think the pharmacies when they see a doctor over prescribe it have a responsibility to report that position so I think that maybe that's part of the problem\nThe report that position so I think that maybe that's part of the problem although I I Am not highly qualified to but this is just my personal opinion\nSure you know there's a a definitely a personal opinions on those topics in the complex that can be a whole nother\nShowing a on that as well but ah definitely needs to be addressed a you know being on the front lines like we are five right just right now we see it every day a multiple times it's like for shifted people sane people sometimes and it's just a it's a tragic situation that I'm trying to trying to work you know pick your\nYeah you know as I say I'm a citizen of adult role I actually drove by um I think it was last week where firefighters have near um administering narcan into some person on the sidewalk and I I just pray that that person made it you know yeah\nI Know speaking of which she talked about you know embarrassing Arkin tied in with this symposium um recently a ... you know represent hockey's really taken a frontline on this as well yeah ... yeah uh but he also went to and it's kind of unique you went and got trained a ...\nThere's a lot of organizations out there that the train the layperson or\nThat you know to carry it around and give them kids and stuff to just in case you run into it hopefully he never will hopefully as a person doesn't get exposed to that\nBut if a circumstances arise or he's been he's been trained so ah quite a you know come in for that ... I never I've never heard of anyone doing that and learn to myself about lay person getting trained on that so it's you know commend them on that's pretty good job yeah it sounds\nLike he's very proactive about that and um he's co sponsoring that symposium so where you are with the firefighters food involved in this as well [noise]\nUh this one here hum we will be a initially um but we are working with representative in a ... and others across the state and trying to you know 'cause\nUm but we are working with representative in a ... and others across the state and trying to you know because we are in the front lines uh Oh yes and just a you know with our brothers and blue and public safety as a police department were one together in a you know we want to make sure that um we put our part and do what we can to besides the response but to educate in the ... tried to assault situation\nNow did you get on the numbers down do you have numbers about that how many friends that you've had and and different things that have happened here in in locally\nSure I have a some statistics I mean I'm just I'm well look at the er overdoses from twenty Thirteen to twenty Seventeen or in\nTwenty Thirteen we had Seventy five incidents but the six deaths or look at twenty Seventeen numbers what you incidents one forty nine with thirty six deaths um\nIt's you know this year already teen is is decreased as well so we are and it was still putting the numbers together for this but looking at him you know a briefly they are they're already over twenty Seventeen numbers and that goes incidents and deaths which is a you know scary\nVery scary yeah do you find that I'm looking you attribute you to write\nA probably a lot of different factors you know I mean we talk about the pharmaceuticals the doctors are different things in individuals' lives you know that goes from\nOpioids to ah to drug use heroin you know get on one and it gets taken off that than you find a substitute and I'm definitely a definitely and it's all walks of life I mean it's not a\nYou know not in my neighborhood kind of thing that that doesn't happen anymore it's a no it's\nIt's all walks of life and you you know you you walk in and respond to these homes and of all different\nTypes of people and it's just a it's every once in a ...\nDifferent uh types of people and it's just a it's everyone's affected everyone uh one of the things that you know it's that I personally think is one of the possible or\nJust in the solution is just a support for the family and friends you know what I mean it's got a\nYou've got to help you help your loved ones help your friends your neighbors and just support them all through the crisis through their addiction and uh try to help them out there was a ... or like you know the\nViews that concept not going to you know not in my neighborhood or not and you know my house but you never know what's gonna happen so you know someone like that definitely support them as much as they can I really think you got to stay with him right away on them if they can help them get the support and hope that they need\nRight I have a question as a ... percent um\nWe said opiate addiction and ... it's a broad based brush\nAnd average when if you could break that down because it's what is opiate addiction that definition um because it's not just\nPeople that I'm abused drugs I mean it is people abusing drugs but I mean it's like everyone it I'm taking you know medicine prescription fat and all and other things correct\nCorrect I mean it goes on on all different things it starts at at one level whether it be as minor injuries two surgeries and getting prescribe drugs and then getting addicted to those drugs [noise]\nUm than either it's not enough for you could take it off those drugs and he just that that craving that addiction and it's a disease and you find other things such\nAs heroin and other drugs such as those and it's just a it's very sad scary situation\nRight right and the only way to break that addiction is rehabbing and a subway\nYes I I Would agree hundred percent that's part of it you know getting the help for and you know obviously a recognizing a knowing being aware of it in and actually\nRecognizing knowing being aware of it and actually a recognized and saying hey there's a problem here and then um you know like the individual you talked about earlier you know there are obviously seems like Seventeen years is a it's a problem if ah you know you want to address that someone she'd say\nSit him down and have a cat and see if we can go from there\nRight right I got to hold you right there and we're going to take a quick thing okay sounds good things are so much fun you're listening to you out

get onto your bandwagon with this and just legalize\nEverything I just don't know\nThey ... they they they kind of did it was um heroin by coming up with 'em\nAnd I ended up the money part is that

[noise]\n\nMourning mourning all police and fire personal civil servants gr employees of course good on number forty one\nYou'll be on the radio show no sign must be wondering\nBut we have a guess for a half hour to talk about the question\nWe have a guest a for a first half hour to talk about um question one\nAnd of course are you going to chime in and five oh one to two surgeries royal\nLet me just to start with our guests are Karen how are you I'm good how are you very good years your last name yet my name's Karen Coughlin Karen Coughlin a new dangerously near me All right Karen I'm you're a nurse I Am a nurse gray ARSA thirty four years\nTell me about question wind ... what is a question what\nIs it OK published so question one would set a limit on the number of patients that could be assigned to a nurse at one time we do not have limits currently on the number of patients that can be assigned to interest except in our intensive care units in state of Massachusetts so\nThe limit would vary based on the type of hospital unit that Iran and the severity of your illness um it includes exceptions for public health emergencies and there is flexibility within that that if you're a condition where to deteriorate and you needed\nMore nursing care at any given moment in time that the flexibility we'd be able to go down so why why do we need this will\nSo what we've found is that there are\nPretty much have and have nots in the state of Massachusetts when it comes to nursing care in the hospital settings this would set a standard across the state of Massachusetts we have\nThousands in this year alone of nurses within the facilities that are represented by the mass nurses association at least filing unsafe staffing documentation forms saying that\nThey are being assigned to many patients at one time and so things get messed outcomes you know I'm a poor up when a nurse does not have the time too\nI'm a poor when a nurse does not have the time\nTo attend to all of your needs so this is something that we felt was important for the safety and for the care to patients in Massachusetts it's something that's been going on we've been trying to address this for well over Twenty years without success in various\nWays whether it's through contract pocketing whether it's through the legislature whether it's working having our nurses working on staffing committees within the hospital's working specifically with a hospital executives and the hospitals associations\nAnd we haven't been able to get it address to other people who won't address at the math on spittle association\nNow this is this is because I mean ... our boilers down from a lot of ... to to the reason that they are against it is because it's going to cost them more in nursing staff is that right\nI Believe that the reason that they are against it ... honestly it's because it's going to put a Damien to their profits yeah there\nWere there was a there was a um a letter to the editor today or in the sun chronicle and revise chronicle\nYou know I'm Sorry I should I Do get it may have already [laughter] a sigh him where he really is going to send me bills are doing [laughter] Hi I'm a [laughter]\nAnd the director of a one of the directors icy or whatever when the doctors from a\nFrom a sturdy a yard Dr Patel I think there's there's\nUm he was telling how this is terrible and you know we don't need it you got to your air and then he got to a point in the least we don't need a lot we don't have the staffing deal is this question was how are we don't need a and one of the things he said was that you know well\nThey have this in California for governor and it didn't improve\nIt didn't improve care at all and\nAnd it didn't improve it didn't improve care at all\nAnd uh and my point was where you weren't at you you didn't talk in the ... and we'll\nTalk about K turned to my body's didn't talk about care and now all of a sudden it didn't improve care would always talk about improving you're talking about not taking care down right because that's what happened now I'm full disclosure I should mention that I've you know I've been a mental patients kind of\nAll I'm Sorry I Know that I ... and I will say oh I Know my sister's interest I Would say that my ... years\nAnd she's a ... semi retired and she was older than dirt but\n[laughter] I'm sure she will love you for that I Am actually a lot of other originally they love 'em and a larger and when I was a kid\nAh I worked as an orderly and a show with nurses and um [noise]\nYou you got to be dedicated and what you do and then that they're not\nActually sure that there's got to be a calm yeah so okay so so what do you want people to do tell him\nTo a guy and tell him take I put my papers but I'm not going to tell people to to take a hike um\nI Would say is that yes we have a lot of hospital executive so coming out and saying vote no on this question I Would also say that when we started this campaign we we have a coalition\nOf approximately three hundred organizations whether they're um health care organizations nursing within his nations um social justice organizations interfaith organizations um yes we also have other union is with us and we have many elected officials\nUm who are saying that this you know did they endorsing supporters on this that being said\nWhat is it when you strip everything else away when you strip all of that way when you strip away that yes it's going to cost them money and it will cost some money for this this\nIn a way when you strip away that yes it's going to cost them money and it will cost some money for this there's no denying that there is\nConflicting you know numbers that are out there but I Would say that isn't what this is about this is about taking care of the patient at the bedside\nThis is about making sure the bad things don't happen because we know and despite the fact that they can talk until they're blue in the face to say that there's no scientific research research that's up to\nTheir regimes of scientific research that are out there that shows when you are aside a patient above a specific number\nThan outcomes become more and more I mean they've done is they've done it with teachers\nRight did you have a hundred and Ninety people in a class in four different for different grades right and that is ... what we try to teach their safety\nIssues that are that are all out there that that that is hitting that are regulated so be it used to a a teacher\nYou know we're going to double your class size we're going to give you fifty students do you think you're going to be able to get them talk anything did him down the educated in the classroom you know they're not um we have regulations related to how many people can be in the middle of it for God's sake we have regulations on how many dogs can be allowed to do it get all the safety reasons\nWe have regulations related to how many healthy children can be in a daycare\nBut once that child become sick and requires hospital get there's no limits as to the number of patients that nurse can be assigned with with sick children now\nIt was written by nurses who work at the bedside in those various settings and then they went out and collected nurses and other supporters with the nurses went up and walked it over a hundred thousand signatures across the state of Massachusetts jarring this to the ballot\nUm and so it is not it's the absolute opposite among them in ... in addition when they say they continue to say oh it's too rigid it is not rich and there was flexibility built with them so that the hospitals would have to\nDevelop and acuity tool which is actually something that just takes a look at the experience of the nurses in particular on that that unit that day\nUm the severity of the patients illness how much do they actually need to they need more attention than another patient um et cetera those types of things the physical layout of the unit etcetera\nAnd all those things would have to be developed and then certified by the health policy mission so the nurse at the bedside who absolutely at this moment in time has no autonomy and authority\nTo determine I had too many patients and when they have made you know these unsafe staffing reports most often times you know\nThe response as well do the best you can that's what you've got a caller hello you're on the air\nI'm Sorry I didn't light on your on your topic I Am a retired nurse but\nBut in late on your on your topic I Am a retired nurse but so we're like Karen represent yes no I\nYou know she just seemed to go to represent the yes side\nThat's where I thought okay good okay um oh like I Do agree with that on having a kid\nA writer's relatives in nursing homes especially and in the hospitals are there is all the way I think a shortage and I wonder if they are very surprised that Dr Patel I don't know him personally\nI have a patient in the ER there and I had had patients there\nUm I I was so I can respect him but I just really surprised at\nWell understand understand something to do then you know this guy a is working for a show the hospital and there are a lot of pressure on people to make a stand et cetera do have to keep their own thing so you know die too hard on them I mean I'm\nNot I'm not at all but um I I agree with Karen I read I I was gay confused and I'm I'm driving home and I'm thinking what side are we talking\nThem I'm not I don't watch the yes side but I wanted to class I yes I I I Am in favor\nOf of what Karen just disgusting I okay uh my thoughts or loose and now I appreciated\nForeign and you're very welcome thanks for the gold appreciate five a way to to to Thirteen twenty telephone number to call you know um\nThis is interesting because my you know I mean I'm easily confused as you know do I know what I read this letter from the tone and and then we go down to California ... California and it it really took a left [laughter] well there's no proof that the uh care has improved\nAnd and I thought\nProof that the uh care has improved and and I and I thought when we talk above that obviously first of all if you have three house painters your house has got to get paid it better and faster hello [laughter] uh I mean you you don't need to you know go into a\nYou know a study of that ... ... ... it's amazing to me though that people\nThemselves who are dedicated to medicine doctors and physicians assistants and whatever that they would feel comfortable talking against is how do you do that everyone\nAll right so [laughter] I I Wonder how sometimes how they sleep at night I honestly do and I would say to that that in all honesty you know the no side is being completely driven by the hospital association and backed off real sensation and that's where these physicians worked for\nUm that's where they get their salaries and their bonuses from cetera\nYeah my my for my very first response when I\nFirst heard this without knowing anything of course which is how I always Lucia [laughter] or\nIs it this is this was a nursing union thing yes wanting to\nGet more jobs for nurses and all ... a safer well no I I Know I Am I my first thought was oh it was a union yeah saying oh well this is a way to get more and more nurses on there and then they'll vote and then when the yeah yeah that was my first instinct because I hadn't read all the details\nAnd so I think that's a common mhm mistake\nThat's a common mistake in when I Would say to that is one of the benefits of being in a union and I am a union member I'm actually the vice president of the mass nurses\nSets of being in a union and I am a union member I'm actually the vice president of the mass nurses association get a I\nHave to do\nIs that because I'm a union member I have a protected voice so I have the ability to go out and do one of the things that is\nThe first tenant of being a registered nurse which is to advocate for my patients and I have a protected voice that because I can do that without repercussion and without retaliation at my work site\nUm I'm protected and we have to do that and we have many nurses they don't have that protection and they are feeling intimidated and their work sites that are non union facilities and they also want that but they can't express that you know\n... yeah absolutely oh yeah yeah so I Do I mean the mother over a union you know ...\nIt was so much better for us to be able to let's say carry the water for this um issue because of that protected right that we can be the ones that go out there in ...\nI'm I'm just I just thought it was very important to make that point because when you read it first flush you there when you go you know I\nI have a twin brother who are registered nurse and he works at a non union facility and he calls me all the time\nWith you wouldn't believe with the development of a day to the nurses are saying to them and they're asking them to hand out and vote no on on a Russian one to the patients and the hospitals winding up the patient portals you know which is where they can email all the patients on site you must vote no one question one and this is why\nAnd why and what did that way that they say you might well they'll say no Austin if the government mandate and then ... already lost\nIt will say no Austin if the government mandate and rigid on his times will added a lot of low services were closed units\nAnd let me tell you that in California which is a much larger state when it's seven I'm In the United states one in seven United States citizens lives in California so there are much much less than us and no one hospital close and not one service closed [noise]\nUm so you know they they they scream above behavioral beds will close and this and that you know yes we do have an issue with mental health um access to care cetera um but when it would also say is that many of the um\nPeople that provide dental services in the state of Massachusetts belong to a very very large corporations ... multiple states ... and have profits that reach into millions and millions of dollars and and they're making choices right now as to where to spend the money as it is and they're closing services right now\nWhen they're making like for instance Providence hospital out in the western part of the states that just close services for the elderly and a psychiatric unit for children\nBut they're they're they belong to that parent company is known as trinity health and their across multiple states and they made seven hundred I see no one point three billion dollars in profits last year\nYou know what I mean in the upper system that they're also owned by a very large really universal health services incorporated who in two thousand and sixteen their profits for that year\nWas seven hundred and two million dollars\nSo you know and not really it just it just bothers me so much when they decide to prey on the most vulnerable to scare them about this particular issue um to say that you know behavior that sort of clothes or you know the elderly\nShoo 'em to say that you know behavior that sort of clothes or you know the elderly like you won't be able to you know your local hospital clothes or you know you were going to shut down services and you'll have on October ... already if she was like you know and you'll have to go somewhere else so you know\nUm and you know it's done purposely so\nTo change the ... and let me tell you\nThey've got big big pockets they have already spent like over Thirteen million dollars to defeat this in radio and TV ads et cetera and that type of thing and they're willing to spend up to twenty million of we I've heard that\nThey will probably spend more money on trying to defeat this question then what was spent on the casino though sure wow\nA lot of them because it's I actually have it in the lakes are yeah so yeah [noise]\nUm so you've been doing this now for how long are\nFighting for question why do I want to have all your foot in his foot so you know what I Would actually say when I went into nursing I never ever anticipated that I Would have to be doing anything like this this is this is why it became in our\nUm but when I bring it all down to just one level it's like you know\nMaintenance people that come in and help clean that I guess who's doing it ... the woman with the white shoes yeah ... is doing yeah [noise] I says he goes back to when she used to put her her hat with\nSand or out on the side of ... cap on the side of the fridge a long time ago and and so yeah all had cat [laughter] yeah and so and so you ...\nYou don't you get a an overall image of something and you don't get the nuts and bolts image you don't realize what goes on you don't realize trying to make a patient comfortable\nWho is the size of a grand piano and trying to rule them so you can change the shape\nYeah that that's got a lot to do with money too because if they were appropriate lifting devices\nExactly ... showed me that in our ... and I would say in California to what we saw was\nWhen they had and you know they brought the numbers up and they passed the staffing that um statistics have shown that the occupational injuries to nurses in California has gone down\nWhen I take a break we're going to come back and they were going to wrap up with Karen you're listening to Canaan company or whether you like it or not in order to\nAccommodate working parents and schools dimes and unlikely story in

everything this company is looking for an entry level candidate great your enemy isn't quite what we're used to but you've got a fantastic work ethic thank you and I'm impressed by how you count yourself\nSo should we talk about the job to job oh sorry guys ... or even meeting you this interview didn't happen\nIt may sound ridiculous and that's because it kind of is there is a huge pool of time with your company's missing out on meet the grads of life\nWhy they talent worth knowing about young adults have unique determination and experience an ideal fit\nFor your company in an entry level position internship or even mentorship they might not have every qualification you typically look for but they're exactly who you're company [noise] green like don't miss out on a resource many innovative companies have already discovered go to graduate dot org to learn how to find cultivate and trained is great pool of untapped down\n... by the council of graduate life dot org [noise]\nOh I see the [noise]\nWe're talking with Eric off one who is with the messenger association and uh she is here to try to encourage you to vote\nYes on question one a mess that shows the November ... is right\nAnd so I'm listening have you miss it do anybody just trust me on this phone one vote yes on one and and and that'll be fine um there's a lot you can look up you're going to hear a lot of stuff you're going to hear\nThere's a lot you can look out you're going to hear a lot of stuff you're going to hear 'em a lot of um of\nSmoke and mirrors ... leaves the antebellum vote no\nYeah I don't just just realizing how to think of yourself or you're in bed it's two o'clock in the morning you feel all my crap and you had to butter and um\nYou have to wait because maybe a nurse who's trying to deal with Thirteen other people um wouldn't it be nice to be able to get somebody sooner than\nGo on 'em so vote\nOdious question one and and yeah maybe we can get their\nYou um I just want to if I if you don't mind I just wanted to talk about a couple of the other things that are being set out there and that is scaring people um we're hearing about the January first date like oh if this passes January first hospitals we're only going to have thirty seven days do you put in place and you know big cetera\nUm that is so not true the only thing that needs to be in place by January versus the hospitals neat to submit a plan as to how they would implement Eric I'm In addition they said well we don't have enough nurses um Massachusetts has\nPlenty of nurse I Would think so we're you know one of the highest in the in the nation for nurses per capita in all actuality a recent study came out from the University of Nebraska that shows Massachusetts is one of two states South Dakota being second\nUm that will have a surplus if nurses through twenty thirty wow in addition we have one of the highest rates in the nation of nurses who work part time or ... bird in\nTwo thousand approximately nurses that work part-time upper damn who if this\nPasses and I am sure well if you know the boat as you know do what they should\nI'm passes and I am sure well if you know the boat as you know do what they should I home um that\nYou know I'm ready willing and able to already be that they're already at the bedside and they're willing to work you know more hours and part time I'm In a dish and I'd also say it they have time to train those nurses\nUm because ballot in his shoes take time acuity till needs to be developed regulations needs to be sent place by the health policy commission for reporting um ... those types of things I'm so it would probably take at least a year and a half to two years to be fully implemented\nAnd until it's fully implemented that would be no science so she had with that and we're also hearing hospital\nSay well we'd be fined twenty five twenty five thousand dollars for each violation of the stuff\nThat is not true and not true if they were not in compliance [noise] um and it's not the nurse who'd be fined if she took on an additional patient it's the hospital that would be fined first it would have to be reported\nAnd the ... [noise] so tell us about that was a flu like you know I'm going to happen again or was it just like a one time thing\nUm if it was a ... it was a fluke they'll probably do nothing but if hospitals continuously Ira noncompliance with the the the numbers\nUm then the potential would be to the health policy commission would say that the attorney general I think you need to take a look at this because this hospital\nContinues to you know flip the law and not for it so and then finds would be anywhere between nothing up to twenty five thousand dollars so that also is a process it's not an automatic fine it's not like somebody just calls up in a hotline and says well find those ...\n... ... you know so um but they're but they're scaring people\nAnd twenty thousand Traveller but you know so um but the but they're scaring people but the fines and about how nurses and and everything else and I would also say that you know they say well you\nCan't go above you limit listen you can't assigned me above my limit but that doesn't mean I Can't help out my colleague might work Cali yeah if they're asking for assistance with a particular patients nurses do that all the time and that will continue yes\nAnd when patients show up to an emergency room because there's been some tragic accident or something I guess what\nThey will be attended to\nJust like they are now but hopefully\nThat a better Medicare pay that there'll be more people ... and they they their new thing is though hold in the wall and oh yeah yeah yeah I'm ambulances lined up and let me tell you where does it ... times are pretty bad now in Massachusetts and in California there is an old in a while\nThere is there's none of this up if you think if you like picture what'd your head in California\nAmbulances you know down the street and around the corner it's been in effect for fourteen years that if that was true don't you think they would have done something they know about that for ten years hasn't happened wow Mm hasn't happened\nAll I mean all of a long as they can you know yeah\nOh and there are lots and let me ...

doing very very well we're doing everything that we need to do from a campaign standpoint but I think even before that more importantly um you know I've been out here for years I think that's one of the biggest things for me\nIt was interesting I did have the lieutenant governor come down here last Saturday and she endorsed me and we had a great crowd great crowd down there and at that point in time\nLet me just like a lawyer and challenger and she was brought into the studio you know [laughter] you know\nYou know what they tell me if they do the same thing except that some of the guests to you know when I came to my thing the first thing her handler I call them handlers yeah he's my handler [laughter] the first thing that they did when they walked in which said she's got this amount of time she's got to be out of here by the\nYou know 'cause I'm going to be here is so speed it up with those who are listed\nYeah we found out on a Monday and I put something together for that weekend and it turned out very very nicely than we did it over at the VFW home was very nice but one of the things I mentioned when I was speaking to people\nWas you know you think about what's going to happen everybody gets anxious everybody wants to win mhm but I sort of you know you have to sometimes to look around and say to yourself but have contributed so far\nAnd then I kind of one of last week I also got to take a tour through sixty seven mechanic street which is very important to me because it was something that was something\nI Want to talk about the river color for years are higher on the air\nMuch decay and oh you sure good what's up much joy girlfriend\nWho Hi Jeffrey oh hey Jeffrey how are you yes I knew you were going to rearm usually show you your ...\nFree how are you yes I knew you were going to be army as we saw you yesterday and you ...\nUh I have got to be a terrific state representative and I know she'll do well in the in the state legislature 'cause I worked together on a coming together and or should we terrific for this area and I think you'll have reversed\nYou All right John thanks a lot there's you know ... to ... to ... over ... ... this was the ... canceled Jeff very that's a that's the one [noise] so you were saying about sixty seven mechanical failure\nYou know I run I run every other day and one of the things is I run by this building and have seen the progress happening there\nAnd what is sixty something like ... or you don't try and I'm ... and I'm Glad you asked it used to be the old\nWatching new will factory very very very famous here the watching family and the interesting thing is that I actually live on the property and live at a twin beach court\nOr ... yeah but that's the second conversation I'm Talking about we're talking about nurses though I Am talking about nurses but I Do talk among ourselves also so I'm saying [noise] you you can't\nAbout nurses and I do not like ours has also so I'm\nSaying you you cannot make an argument say health is not going to increase of of the health care and not going to be better if you have more people to do it God is are we are more people to paint this room than less I'm going to do it faster\nAnd better if you have the right people doing\nRight so that's ... so when I kind of a ... picking the right people were talking about people qualified to be nurses and whether or not these nurses have enough help to get to the bodies that are as you just it's ascribed so varied and right\nSo I'm confused about that I I I'm surprised I thought you were going to tell me that you thought it was or on the idea that um so the alternative would be what\nTo do to what do you\nWell if the problem is there's a problem is I have is there and there you go\nWhen I was the problem that we're trying to solve\nThe problem is trying to solve is to make sure that the health care is better and covered and listen my sister was a nurse or I worked in hospitals I worked when I was at high school I worked three to eleven as an orderly many times over do live in the seventies I said earlier and and I'd sleep during the class so [noise] so\nYeah there's been an assumption from the beginning that the healthcare it's not good\nAnd I didn't say nothing ... about that but no no I don't say not good and I said that it could be better I didn't say nothing but I said when you hire more nurses when you hire more transmission experts when you hire more dentists you get more teeth fix then you get more you get\nBetter and when you hire more teachers you get better education you get more programs\nBy and class size it goes down here that's one of the ... you get your health as true album you have me on ratings problem\nIs yeah you need resources to do that and if you don't have the\nProblem is yeah you need resources to do that and if you don't have the resources are you that for money okay and money comes down\nTo ... teaching is his taxing\nWe're talking about for profit hospitals and then the great majority of for profit hospitals now so so you know the teaching when it come teaching a good example how many times have you seen\nI mean I was I I went to school and the very first teachers strike happened yeah because of a among other things class size right\nSo we know that we are more teachers we have less people in their class kids get treated better right so the ... the argument about ... more nurses isn't going to improve the health care doesn't wash them\nAgain put where do you get the money to do that and that's what this caller proud hospitals\nBut I'm Talking about a not for profit hospitals and that that's the difficulty when you make decisions that are sent down from the government legislatively they affect all hospitals if we could carve out just for profit hospitals and say oh this is only going to apply to for profit hospital\nYou know that might be a different story but this is going to and I'm going to come back to Adel borough we have a hospital here that struggles it does make a profit it is one of the few hospitals that that's a community hospital that is a not for\nProfit hospital and it will affect the hospital here and I'm here to represent this district you know so you know this has been successful in California for fourteen years\nFourteen years have been doing this that's correct ... successful well they said it hasn't really shown that it's changed that much and it's one of the if you think about it to\nHow many years it has it been for the perjury how come no other states have adopted it because people were fighting against a glove is a good reason to fight against it\nStates have adopted it hurts people were fighting against it glove is a good reason to fight against it\nWell no I don't know I mean I live in the fight against it but it's because people were fighting is that because it doesn't work is not because it's not proven it's not because I mean God I mean are you going to say that about cigarette smoking I mean look how long it took us to get people off cigarettes yeah\nLet's do like this is you know this is one of those things where there's two sides of the store yeah\nAnd yeah I'm just I Know and I'm and I know and I know I'm not going to get ready to vote for it I'm trying to understand like why shouldn't ... illegal listening to us want to hear use Thomas a that's all\nYeah and I I can tell you from my own experience\nA better way of doing care the best way to do care it's if you have a great management team that works together\nWhere the docks the nurses the managers they all work together gift there and I think the difficulty is that they have is when they are at hospitals where that doesn't happen then shame on those managers that aren't able to listen to that nursing staff\nThat they should be listening to that nursing staff and as a nurse and just saying that they do have a difficulty at that particular hospital it's up to that management team to fix that\nBut he says no all over the state is saying we do have this difficulty and they're saying down that's misinformation also it is not nurses all over the state\nWell it's a state wide question it but it's not nurses all over the state and why you have somewhere where we're of either that's why you have some nurses that are saying some nurses say no because there's a group of nurses that also say no so there's two different groups that you're talking\nYou know but that doesn't you know but that does the game is is all over the state the nurses all over the state or all over the state whether another a majority we'll find out on November six but my question my but you're saying shame on management for now listening to nurses added the nurses are saying we need more than ...\nNot all the nurses that are saying that they ...\nThere's a saying we need mourners ... not all the nurses that are saying that they need more nurses that are involved search will find that's correct now tell me something you agree with him on ... rip\nI think the opioid crisis I think he's been out there doing some stuff with the opioid crisis and so so by um he's got some good ideas on that we also agree on senior tax\nOn issues really for the new taxes how do you do it\nThere are fourteen states actually in the United states that have a senior tax freeze some of them have different levels some of them are income based meaning you have to have a certain income thresholds\nAre I guess if well the lower ... correct yeah in order to be and some of the states just have an age threshold with no income which I I I like that I liked that idea I'd love to go to that idea in other words you turned sixty five years old and your taxes are freeze for the rest of your life\nI liked that idea to be quite honest with you I don't know how you know physically you're able to were able to do that but I think that people that have lived to be sixty five years old and have worked hard it doesn't matter what their income bases they should get a break just the way feel\nYeah go from ... you started to [laughter] you're there for another one in three years if I should take sixty five and it'll be good sushi [laughter] knowing\nFull well whatever qualified oh did you ... are they things but I think it's a great I really do I ... I hear this from people all the time the seniors one of the biggest things they worry about is especially if they're on a fixed income taxes go up all the time supplies go up all the time um\nAnd yet their income doesn't Mm and and they do have to start making decision\nAnd yet their income doesn't Mm and and they do have to start making decisions now people want to stay in their homes for a long long time and I think if they're able to do so and capable of doing so safely they should have every opportunity to to age in their own home\nGo take a break when we come back more with Julie Ogle and we're speaking with her because of course she's running for us to rip job and uh if you'd like to chime in as five or ... to to to Thirteen twenty police chime in\n'cause her campaign manager looks like he's so hang a good or it\nIn order to accommodate working parents and school times and unlikely story in plain ... hostess Sunday story time on the first Sunday of every month story time consists of a half hour of stories songs and simple craft and is recommended for ages two to six but all story lovers are welcome\nRegistration will open one week before only children need to register the next story time will take place on Sunday October seventh and eleven AM and run until eleven thirty to register for the event you can visit their website and unlikely story dot com\nExcuse me I Know you have a nine o'clock so I'll keep it short I'm a business suit in the back of your closet you warming nearly every day before your office went quote casual\nI used to be the c._e._o. of your closet now I'm just that one interns no one ever talked to I always thought you'd circle back with me get granular keep me in the pipeline but not a\nNothing don't you're a member of the ... presentation you still coffee on me and I still looked amazing during the break out talk back to you in a so I think it's time for me to move on I've got a great resume and I absolutely crushed in interviews okay let's make this a clean break shift the paradigm the only\nIn interviews okay let's make this a clean break ship the paradigm the only thing I ask that you think outside the box here and do this take me to good well where I can really make a difference\nYour donations to good will create new jobs training programs and education assistance for people in your community to find your nearest donation center go to goodwill dot org donate stuff create jobs message from goodwill and the ad council [noise]\nCalls radio\nLong commutes outside\nThan this campaign manager automated ... wanted to know what my Nielsen ratings are some like goodness [noise] now down I Will tell you\nHow funny that is fell down a why why is that funny for her to ask me that you know we're not on the news and\nWe'll send isn't TV ratings says yes\nNot on the news and we'll send his TV ratings says he has not radio [noise]\nAnd then I got another so I said well thanks you know that's so\nThen I got another email and it said well maybe I talked to the candidate maybe we can you hear picking at ... Fitch you in something like that on a Saturday in November oh my goodness I'm maybe on a maybe a Saturday in November\nLike after the six [laughter] yeah there's one in\nNovember third and nobody said to me can we get November third oh it was a maybe a Saturday So I was going to offer them the ninth or tenth whatever it is right up but I'm just I'm I just wanted to we have to deal with the biggest dummies in the world who decide they want to be campaign managers\nYou of course I'm Talking about\nAnd this is how it harms candidate yeah because the Kennedy has no idea right that this is going on now absolutely has no idea\nSo I always go to the candidate I always made sure I get to them because not for nothing new people to try and help whatever of but they are sometimes clueless and the candidate get screwed out of it and the voter get screwed out of it because a good candidate\n... might have gotten more votes if they had been on ...\n... you know and no and and the ... of the press\nChicken off medium and right away it's like one of the ways because somebody and I can say this huge early if somebody knows enough to pick the right pick us up campaign manager that isn't an embarrassment maybe the rest of her choices\nA campaign manager that isn't an embarrassment maybe the rest of her choices and offers will be as good yeah you know what I'm saying so interesting to find that into sites\nYou know I think one of the things I find even if I go to in a place\nEvery event that I go to there's always one person who introduces me to another person and I feel the same way I should all diversity read the first time\nI I feel the same way about the radio or any time you get to me this is an event this is reaching the public and if there's one person out there today that says hey listen I like what she said I like the way she talks I like her background I'll take them one at a time\nAnd people will talk about you if they've heard you if somebody else hasn't heard around the interview the da da da da da and that is true and it's true in the paper it's true in any television thing is true\nBut it's just too bad because you have these people who decide they're going to run for office I have no clue what they're doing and then they get somebody who has no clue what they're doing to manage the gift fame right right and it's really tough and Kennedy's could beat up for that\nThey do and I think I'm One of the things that's really important and John and I've talked about there are candidates where their their campaign is totally run by other people and they don't even know what those other people are saying or writing if you would\nAnd putting out there we make sure that actually spend a lot of time discussing how we're going to answer particular questions we look for different things I have a certain style that I like to speak\nBut they might come back to me and say you know what the average person isn't going to understand that especially the healthcare stuff make a going to the nth degree of healthcare obviously and they're sitting there you know\nBlah blah blah blah yeah okay like\nYou have health care obviously and they're sitting there you know\nBlah blah blah blah yeah okay like time to wake\nUp you know cause I bought him to tears and um it's gotta be something that you're able to speak to where everybody understands that you and I'm Down to what you need other people\nForeign concise and in simple you're going to simplify out I don't know where you're really going to simplify your dog inside baseball and then write your loose and he ended up ... sometimes and smoke and mirrors\nRight in that cycle you know and I and I think that's the other thing too I have had\nI'm a person who likes to speak their mind if I don't know about something\nIn particular to a a high you know a high degree I I usually say that you don't I haven't looked at that very carefully I see a lot of things I read a lot ... ... ... every day I read this stuff called statehouse news ... state House news puts out in some\nAge I Know you're Seventy something from it yeah I read it [laughter]\nSee I'm like I should have been like the ice fell on what you said maids element I Can't remember which one I sent oh when did I send her mind that you don't want to say oh my God I don't know how to do with a lawsuit nova love that [laughter]\nI must have to do with somebody's rights like the freedom of speech or celebrate Labor Day or something and disorder but um\nYeah so I read I read that and lots and lots of information and people I think you know to ask you a different questions and often times it might be a question that you don't know the answer to and that's the hardest one how do you answer that would cause people expect you to know where they do they expect you know a little bit of everything and\nThey expect you to know everything in spurts you to see what they want you to hear when you say they want to hear you say what they want you to say well you don't\nGet it I Would I go to ... people do ask them some of those tough questions how do I feel about something and I can tell you can read them right off the bat like which way they're they're they Leno to you\nAnd I can tell you can read them right off the bat like which way they're they're they're Leno to you and I make sure\nIt's important to me that I make sure that they understand that if I don't agree necessarily and I know I Know I could just walk by and I could say oh yeah or you know changed the conversation but I make sure that they understand clearly that\nI may have a different opinion on that from them and hope that they'll still vote for me and\nWe have other things Clemens I usually will keep talking to somebody until I get their vote from them you know sometimes I Do that just certain people you know you can have a ... it's fun it actually is very very fun I get a job and the other day and we kept talking about things and he's talking about the plastic bags\nAnd he thought I was there to talk to him about the plastic bag issue and I finally said to him I'm running for state rep and he said oh I thought [laughter]\nAnd I said okay well now that we've talked about the plastic bags are you going to vote for me and uh we started to talk about something else that I think I went through three issues with them and said can do do we go through one more I said to keep talking to you until you say you're going to vote for me so um you can have a little bit of fun with people too and it is enjoyable going out and meet\nIn a while I had I had two people who you know a few people come up to my house you\nShoot stresses you know of\nA war and so to be funny I open the door and I said oh just what I Need to ...

Scott lived back these two men um were the were there when I needed someone to most because um I was going through a rough patch in my life and in wrestling um\nI ... I was being cheated out all these these matches and I needed some guidance and\nBuddy Romano Scotland back these two men they approached me uh they offered me a chance for like a new life a new life and wrestling and I took you I'm\nAnd I'm the bitter club let me just tell everyone out there the better club were not mad at any one All right we are we are band of brothers were there for each other um and that's how it ought to be\nAnd what is it\nOh it's it's it's a Brotherhood it's ah it's it's ... it's ... it's buddy remodel at science it's also a ruby ... we are a group of brothers\nAnd I wasn't really ... your emotional support person\nHe is my use our emotional support person yes yes I'm\nTwice his role I basically other than being the most sport person what would you say Israel\nA ... by you know to be there for us to motivate us down to support us to get us there um to help us um take our game up to the next level that's what he's therefore okay\nI'm going into um obviously like I'm just going from being a professional in the rain but also being but right outside the rank let's talk or let's go into that like I guess you're looking at it from a professional standpoint uh um what would you say that like I'm a professor in life like would you say ... like a reflection life would you say it's like a different persona\nWrestling I I feel like um\nIt reflects in life would you say it's like a different persona\nWrestling I I feel like I'm\nWrestling wrestling you love what you learned wrestling you can use in life and you can apply to life and vice versa um you can learn a lot from wrestling and when you take what you learn from wrestling you put it apply to live\nUm I'm\nBeing a professional it's a it's really important I taught I I've been I've been taught a lot about etiquette and courtesy and respect in this business and I and I bring that I bring that to my life I mean that's my um [noise]\nI um I Do what I Do a lot what I Do and wrestling in my in my real life and uh it's it's been great so far it's been fun\nAwesome yeah I have a question what our um do you have a fear of wrestling move they look to perform\n[noise] uh right now I Am using a under hook DDT in finisher I\nEnded up playing that [laughter] so what do you get disease [laughter] ah the way you\nSet it up as you uh get them bend over you kick them a bit I'm over ... hook them and uh lift him up and drop them on their head it's very fun [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThat like similar to like um I don't know how am I trying to reverse this um could it be similar to like I'm not trying to ... but it was it like similar to that when people one person like Asheville person we dropped on your head when you were little\nOr [laughter] you can somewhat similar to that yeah I'm a little bit and my son [laughter]\nBefore we go next break God's name of ... or like I have another question like I said before we step over to our next breaking brand or the sports master\nOr no on with that being said we are going to go into our next break you're always in the forties sports talk you a new station Thirteen twenty am Wu already on line one word forty sports doctor\nUnion Station Thirteen twenty am Wu our rights on line one word forties for stock dot com we've asked for more rapid is\n\n\n\n\n[noise] ah it's all about psychology like\nWhat we do want to go out there as we we we tell a story that's where we do you tell a story and we tell it we don't tell their stories and much with what we say but it's more about what we do and how we present ourselves um\nIn psychology is probably the biggest part in in all of that and it's it's one of the hardest things that you can really grasp it\nPart in in all of that and it's it's one of the hardest things that you can really grasp and it's one of the things I've I've struggled with myself learning the psychology of of what to do in that ring went to do why we're doing it\nThere's there's a reason behind everything we do in that ring a and that's the point is that to tell the audience\nExactly why we're doing this you know without saying with the words but about ...\nLike when there's a line with the moves around with some of the moves that you do and some of the like facial expression\nOr mannerisms Russia's era you explore presence ... you know when\nDealing how they're doing the right thing and like he also said states all about storytelling and now I said like obviously a I'm I'm I trained with um a Carlos and one thing that I also get with it is that it's like a story you're looking at a book there's five stages of a book\nAnd a beginning middle and then you exactly [laughter] well yeah you have a little more ... more that more deaths and they they um they put\nThat into us and that's how it's instilled and that's how I Am myself and also Carlos ... at it right now what are the advocate pulling meddling the ...
