afternoon or evening getting your Halloween costume pleased to be very careful I guess some of the stores are reporting they will be inundated with customers and\nWe certainly want everybody to you know have a happy shopping experience and and make sure their children get the costume that they want so\nYou know be aware of that be nice to your neighbor do no road rage today I mean goodness let's take a break\nBe nice to your neighbor do no road raged today I mean goodness let's take a break from road rage let's get back to the phones good morning how's the weather looking out there Jim well a ... a ton of you've been mentioning twenty nine degrees that is a frosty temperature certainly so a frost on the pumpkins\nOr some of that scary stuff you were playing out there and a a really a sort of fit for the season or across the area we're going to be reached pope ah\nUpper fifties this afternoon a dramatic rise in temperature winds out of the southwest\nAgain like yesterday five to Fifteen miles an hour but I like yesterday or the clouds more some of the high then variety to me in the sun a little bit afternoon tonight no problems and so you think the trick or treaters or if they start late afternoon I only fall by tomorrow morning to fifty two within rise to sixty\nWith the sun and clouds tomorrow out ahead of a front which eventually low pressure will ride along that it it looks like we're going to get some rain again as I said earlier two batches of it friday and Saturday morning the first one will encompass most of the daytime uh friday with periods of rain perhaps a thunderstorm that's a key\nUh it's fun to storms or in the forecast for some of these\nFootball events especially anything outdoors because it's one thing to get a little rain with a light wins and not a no threat of lightning but if you have gusty winds and some rain and possible lightning that could uh either postponed or possibly\nA delay a game going on so without to monitor that when I was just two days away from that again that friday and Saturday morning\nAnd then suddenly clouds windy Saturday afternoon breaking clouds kind of like we had on Monday if you can remember that where it started out and but then it got better writer in the afternoon that Saturday and right now Tom I think it looks good for Sunday mostly sunny breezy\nSunday a little like it was yesterday with a few puffy clouds highs around fifty degrees and then as we go into Monday of next week of course that is\nOf highs are around fifty degrees and then as we go into Monday of next week of course that is uh the day before election day right now it looks dry and cool about fifty degrees increasing clouds and right now I'm first monitoring this for now over a week election day of course a week from yesterday\nSo it's next Tuesday and costs weather does play a role in elections across the country or anywhere there's an election at least the I guess most people the good thing is we've had these uh early voting situation so some people that just want to get it over with I guess you'd say by the way Tom what you agree with the early voting\nUm yes I Do because it it certainly gets more people to vote you and I have discussed this in in days past where\nMailing votes anyway that they can um you know registered to vote is is good with me and I I think a lot of people do it because they couldn't be out of town a or they just want to avoid it particularly in this election\nThey want to avoid the uh uh a lot of lines I Believe in a lot of the precincts this year because there's so much at stake for ballot questions and to very very a hotly contested races here in the ... area\nYeah I agree that uh you know of course in years past it's always been just\nA absentee voting and sometimes is fraught with that so I suppose if you can get direct going right to a polling place or some in some cases cities and towns early voting does not take place at the where you would normally going to vote or that that means a lot but\nOnly negative about a time that I can figure and I think you might agree and maybe last year when I talk to you about this and whenever it was sometimes there are a last minute things that happened before the first real election that one of the ... or a candidate or something comes up with an if it's an issue a valid\nAnd that's one of the ... or candidate or something comes up with an if it's an issue a ballot something comes up right before that some people suddenly that voted early say oh\nI Want to change my vote and they can't\nThat's the only thing that I've always been this early voting especially since it starts is like two weeks early it's one thing if you had early voting maybe like three or four days you know right before like let's say

we're going to get up into the fifties at least today in Studio my guest state senator from Fox tomorrow Paul Seaney how are you sir how are you doing senator\nI'm doing great this morning thank you it's good to be out nice in early little chillier there would be in this nice warm studio\nSeven o'clock hour [noise] ridiculously high and listenership during morning Dr ... it's good to be here yeah what is going on out there and the way in the campaign and know you recently done two debates one last night uh what are what are people thinking what were some of the questions they asked you last night\nSo I'm just so your listeners know what I mean you know Tom where I got sworn in last November So I uh I Won a special election [noise] excuse me to fill the annexed by a term of state senator Jim to multi ah we took a different job with the county so it's been a whirlwind I guess one in ...\nIm multi ah we took a different job with the county so it's been a world when I get sworn in last November and um you know I'm up for reelection again now for full two year term I'm so we've been campaign and you know when the campaign and nonstop when I got\nSworn into the office last year we had a lot of work to do build relationships around the district get to know a lot of the policy that was a that was coming before the Senate\nSo we had a real busy year we get the budget done and then you know formal sessions ended the summer and it's been you know dealing with constituent concerns in another hearing up the state I was a and trying to balance that time was getting out and campaigning\nI always I always say campaign is like a job interview right I mean I have a track record with going out I mean when voters were knocking on doors were meeting in coffee shops a so that's been\nYou know that's been my life for for for a while now and not I treasure the opportunities that I have to do it we did have two debates myself and my opponent a despite\nI think what most incumbents feel from time to time is that you don't want to they don't want to get into a situation we have to defend your track record or\nYou know elevate your opponent [laughter] for me this is democracy this is what you do this is what the job is a short having the opportunity to debate I I I told my opponent he agreed I said look let's get out there and talk to voters as much as we can\nThree one in ... a couple of weeks ago I kind of a different format and the cable studio and just you know him and I\nLast night was in med field's high school mhm uh which is in the northern part of our district or in in med field you is I'm open to the to the audience they could ask questions so let's go back and forth you know good robust debate so that people can see the clear differences between me and my opponent\nYou know but the overriding issues that come up I think constantly while I'm Out their health care is chief among them whether I'm On the doors talking to people at the senior center and talking to people a health care is is a major issue the cost of it the cost of prescription drugs especially an education\nIt's a major issue the costs of its cost of prescription drugs especially\nEducation education is a major concern for folks making sure that we have the best schools in the country but at the same time that we're able to\nUh to maintain those story able to invest that we're able to make sure that the state is actually sending money back to the to the cities and towns are so that they're not left holding the bag saying you know how do we pay for these increase costs\nSo I Would say those are kind of the two major issues a job certainly in the economy we're doing well right now I mean you know unemployment slow\nMost people are employed wages have kind of stagnated over the years and and you know you lost or those career companies those\nThose places you went when I was a kid where you know my family always told me once you get on the utility company you're set for life right those are those jobs have kind of gone the way the blacksmith so there's a lot of anxiety but where the next jobs can they come from and the economy changing so I've spent a lot of time in the last year\nMaking sure that we're bringing in twenty first century jobs especially into this region a and there were investing in a workforce that we're training a workforce\nYou know with the understanding that colleges unnecessarily for everybody we have to invest in vocational schools and skills training\nAnd when you do that and you can you set up you know students for those jobs are and then you build the infrastructure those companies will come\nThrough with my guest is the state Sen Paul ... from Fox for old but your your district incumbents or is is covering half of Alvaro what other communities as a cover [noise] yes\nSo we it's a pretty pretty large district that starts a step in the north would met field with so we have met fields ... a little bit more than half of the town of Sharon\n... where I live um my with my wife Laura Fox romance field Norton um bought half of Alvaro seekonk and ... with ... [laughter] yes\nI'm about half of Alvaro seekonk and re ... with\nWhile as a good strategy to committed\nIt is it's it's difficult to in you know I always joke in a lot of my colleagues have either\nAn urban district the rural district you know or a suburban district may well three and one which it makes it difficult because there are a lot a lot of challenging needs for each engine community is not you know they are all fit into a nice little boat and say okay this is you know this is the one is you have to worry about\nA but it definitely keeps us on our toes it's it's interesting everyday is different every community is different you know we see different issues down in ... which is more rural and has a unique character as opposed to gateway city like ... or or even a town like men feel that we're in last night so\nYou know it's very interesting a lot of different challenges again chief among them education I think it is an issue that ah is overriding amongst all nine cities and towns in my district but certainly there are a lot of local issues that are germane just to that community ... or so it's important you know for the senator from this district in in the way of approaching job\n\nDouble A. C. S. dot com [noise]\nAll right happy Halloween October thirty first two\nThousand Eighteen in Studio my guest Paul feeding the Democrat from Fox ... in a race\nFor state Senate against Jacob Ventura\nUm how do you defer from Jake adventure or this is the second time you've run against him you both know each other very well um and you know I'm sure he's trying every time every opportunity to make a tax how do you uh how do you make sure that people see the record clearly\nYeah the ... the challenges I think of a campaign like this is um you know you really do get to know your opponent and myself and and my opponent we've been running for the seat a since basically last April ah I think we both got into the race rather similar time last year for the special election\nOf course I prevailed and and then um you know I've been doing the job of of the state senator from his district since November So\nUh you know you you you do get to know your opponent it's difficult when you're out there trying to score political points from me Tom it's always you know we can talk about issues we can disagree without being disagreeable I think what was seen nationally is a disgrace though the the rhetoric that we see in\nThe way people attack each other or just not my style just not my style my point in his team you know I think you've taken a different tack over the last the last year or so um you know it is what it is I mean you get all sorts of political pundits\nYear or so um you know it is what it is I mean you get all sorts of political pundits and consultants and experts to tell you you know you've got to do this you got to do that\nI got you know the greatest advice I think years ago and somebody said look Paul when you when you serve in office you know people get up people that are likely going to trust yet um [noise] for me I I said a lot I mean people and this is this is borne out by actual data and and and science\nAnd people don't necessarily think about politics they feel politics uh it's not you know you can get into a policy you can get him to kind of wonky stuff which is you know people like myself and others that I I Do a lot of time thinking about policy\nUm but really the average voter the average folks out there really just want to know you know you're going to you're going to stand up for them to unify filling me going to give them a fair shake the honest you know be transparent going to be available\nSo that's that's been kind of guiding light in the way that I served in office so I think you know outside of of substance between myself and my opponent we certainly disagree on a lotta on a lot of different issues which I'll get into but you know it does or does a a mock style difference you know not just substance but style\nI approach his job with the evidence that deserves I'm not I'm not an attorney I'm not a business owner here in town I mean I you know I was a working person for over Twenty years I get up every morning before the sun came up went to work and uh you know tried to to build a middle class life for my wife and I and watch my dad so many years working hard and my mom working hard for us and\nYou know that was kinda my frame of reference so I was a you know a worker in the private sector and I saw an opportunity in public service I served as a a select renting Fox ... which is one of the most difficult levels of government I tell you from being a state senator and having experienced as a as a a select person and Fox grow\nThat that level of government is very very difficult because you know it's not a fulltime job you still work and you try to balance\nLevel of government is very very difficult because you know it's not a fulltime job you still work and you try to balance that the time commitments that you have so you're actually\nYou know giving that the job the time that it deserves and making sure that your your you know getting getting down into the issues that that um come up locally but at the same time you know you're trying to balance out out of the commitments uh and you're really the body closest to the people you know you walk into the supermarket and people want to talk about\nYou know the street being paved our dog licensees or all all sorts of stuff that come up in a local community\nSo it's very difficult shown at the local level I had that experience to be able to do that um my opponent is a is a good man I just don't think that he has the experience that it takes for a job like this\nUm he worked for a for a state representative so he certainly knows the building but to know the job and to know the district is different um you know a clear difference between us I moved into this district\nMy wife and I years ago she started a small business or in our home\nWe fell in love with the community I coached youth football I got involved in the community I served in local office you know for me running for state Senate was a chance to to continue that public service and to give back to a district that my wife and I were invested in that we fell in love with\nUm you know and I think from my opponent it was it was a political opportunity so you know there's differences there when it comes down to kind of brass tacks in policy things um you know I think health care is is is a major issue that we need to face I I don't think there's a person out there that there would disagree with me\nI think my approach is a little bit more bold ah I Am certainly an advocate for a sweeping change my health care system both nationally and if we can't do a nationally than we should be leading here in Massachusetts\nTo do something differently um look a health care system is broken and broken and and the solutions that I hear coming from from other folks including my own and it's just kind of need one around the edges [noise] you know maybe we can change this or fix that we need sweeping\nIt's kind of need went around the edges [noise] you know maybe we can change this or fix that we need sweeping changes in our health care and pharmaceutical industry the way that we deliver health care and the way that we ensure healthcare the way that people pay for health care\nNow I don't know what that exact answer is I Am certainly an advocate for Medicare for all type system with the understanding that they're you know increase costs with that I'm On the tax side\nBut also with the understanding that that the consumer actually saves\nThat when you take away those incredible the doctor bills that people get hit with now health insurance is great people that think they have great plans God Forbid you actually get sick and they have to pay for it so\nI'm you know the adoptable to hide it up to ... the co pays the um is that a cost sharing you know that sort of thing we need to address it's not sustainable um so ... you know my I advocate for taking a measured approach\nYou know when we look at a single payer Medicare for all type system you know I understand that you can't just flip a switch 'em as pragmatic is anybody\nAnd they said he could just flip a switch and spend that money and then move your whole healthcare system over to that model\nUm but let's do let's get the data let's look at it let's figure out if this actually works for people and if it works with people\nWon't my God that's what we're supposed to do with government is figure out a way to get their um if it doesn't work and there's another solution and there's another model great let's go there I'm not there's no proud of authorship yeah I'm not tied to a certain model because because that's what I've supported I Want to do what's right or for for for people in our number of people drop the commonwealth\nA and I think we just need to start acting on it so this year\nWe had a sweeping health care cost containment bill that actually came up we run my first week in office\nI got sworn into the Senate and they said welcome here's your keys to your office and here's a three hundred page a\nThat I mean I didn't become an expert and memorize [laughter] I'm In ...\nShe meant that I mean he didn't become an expert and memorize [laughter] I'm a contrary to\nPublic opinion on on on elected officials actually do read every bill and everything that comes before me so\nWe have this cost containment bill and a lot of that was trying to level the playing ... level the playing field between kind of the big boys to pot and its hospitals and the community hospitals you know hospitals like dirty and others are in our district and throughout the state\nSo the idea was to level the playing field and make sure that we adjusted the reimbursement rates so that that um every hospital was successful um and in that there was an amendment filed by a colleague to study a single payer Medicare for all type system\nThere was supported by the minority party supported by the minority leader and that was an important moment I think in that debate because we understood that you know put the rhetoric aside\nPut the the national conversation aside in Massachusetts let's get the numbers let's examine the data and let's do what's right for people so you know ultimately it'll take a couple of years to get that information and that data back but I think we're well on the way to ... you know at least understanding that does a better way to deliver health care\nYes and one of the things one of the issues that I'm sure you've talked about on the campaign trail which is further complicating healthcare is the opioid crisis yeah it is just so devastating to see how many people are dying because of this this whole\nUm way of life I guess for some of these people with opioids and the pills um what are your what what what can we do to 'em fight that problem I Know they just had a a big a forum I Believe you were there right with the state rep Jim Hawkins\nWas not there that day no um we did I spoke with ... about it after we as a and I have my own actually I'm back in the spring a write up right up the road here at the ...\nAnd I held my own actually I'm back in the spring\nI write up right up the road here at the marry a church we we got together and that was at the same time I mean for me my background on substance abuse and and opioids on my previous job I was the legislative director for my union fry BWI local twenty to twenty two which a few thousand a actually a couple of thousand telephone workers and the greater Boston area\nAnd you know this this issue knows no bounds right I mean it's\nThere's no community that's immune to it there's no socioeconomic classes immune to it um you really you can't draw Iraq without hitting somebody that's been affected by the opioid crisis whether it's themselves or a loved one\nSo my frame of reference coming into it is I actually had some ah some close friends who are dealing with this and their families um you know as some coworkers that that are dealt with substance abuse issues\nI write in that area between them and then making your way up past one thirty eight and then twenty four and then over toward twenty eight just that

A. R. A.\nI. set up to your question yes go right ahead\nI Would like to know how to create it wasn't really sure what the law enforcement can\nYou thank you so much for the question I what are you know I come from a place in my life where uh I was raised always respect law enforcement\nCome from a place in my life where uh I was raised always respect law enforcement um I think they do an incredible job\nHere now to Berlin throughout our district and throughout the commonwealth of Massachusetts I ah I I I Am blessed to have a great opportunity with so many of them are a great relationship with so many of them and I'll tell you that I Am proud to to have earned the endorsement in this campaign\nFor the Massachusetts coalition of police the New England police benevolent association Massachusetts corrections officers federal union the professional firefighters in Massachusetts and and just recently district attorney Thomas Quinn a bristle county so I have a great relationship with them a Tom I'll tell you this year I became aware of an issue\nUh from from a lot of local police chiefs I was at a a lunch in I'm back in ... he probably earlier this year and they came to us with an issue a lot of the local uh area legislators and they said look we've been trying to get a dedicated funding source for training\nUm for for over a decade and we've been unable to do that in Massachusetts which in my mind is criminal so I went to work with with a colleague a state senator Julie and see it from the Cape and I said look we need to fix this\nSo this year we were able to um to fix that problem we gotta signed by the governor we had a ah we basically out of the two dollar fee to every car rental transaction that happens in Massachusetts so not per day so if you go rent a car it's on a per day transaction but you know somebody flies in from\nFrom California and they hit Logan Airport or they hid\n'em you know a Massachusetts they want to rent a car to put in a two dollar fee on that on that transaction and that money is dedicated specifically for police training um I'm for ah folks that are can can perform that training and for facilities as well\nSo it's something that that the police officers across his district and across the state of and looking for for years\nI was happy to champion that effort in the Senate and I think it was a um [noise] it was a smart and wise decisions\nIn the Senate and I think it was a um it was a smart and wise decisions my colleagues to adopt that but I have a great relationship with ... endorsed my candidacy\nUm for reelection so I'm I'm proud of that I'm proud of that I work very very closely with them and I think they do a valuable service rout communities and we need to make sure that you know we are doing everything we can to provide them with the resources necessary so thanks for the call\nYes um my guest in Studio state senator uh Paul Fannie from Fox for oh he is in a race against Jacob Ventura\nAnd you'll see his name

... while that's a big big area big district hundred and sixty thousand people and you know but nine cities and towns so yeah yeah it keeps us busy\nPublic service is probably number one and you know our local police department is an excellent excellent police department chief egg needs as a wonderful job this uh this city is safe from many many things because of the work of the ... and I'm sure it's the same for other area is\nIt is and and talking about I'll tell you I mean look something change in this country you know the the conversation around\nWater enforcement and public service being devalued as it is I mean that's\nThat's alarming to me it's it's not it's it's not the way I grew up you know you talk to respect police officers and and I'm often lead to cooperate with them whenever possible and and you know I think that to the national conversation around Lauren force needs to needs to change they need to know that we support them\nThey need to know not only that that a legislator is going to provide them with the resources necessary but they're\nNo not only that that a legislator is going to provide them with the resources necessary but the people that community support them that they you know any uh any time there's the conversation starts to evolve we need to make sure that we're supporting law enforcement it absolutely crushes me when I hear from police officers throughout our district\nI was down in in ... not too long ago and uh they were installing a new chief and you know speaking with some of the uh the officers down they're\nTelling me look ... the conversation is change people don't respect us anymore you know they're fearful they're fearful Everytime they pull over a car or have um you know have a an opportunity to um you know to to be on the community policing our neighborhoods\nWe thank you so much Gina for those excellent traffic reports surely back again tomorrow on the Thursday MORNING EDITION of the good morning a show with

I think of as the divine\nOh very nice why call yourself a which if it's only for yourself or the spiritual and it's you know not related to religion is there a reason why you still want to be called a spiritual\nWhich I'm so most of what I Do is based off of what people would consider traditional witchcraft practices I cast circles I Believe in God and the goddess I worship nature\nI'm so a lot of ... I Believe believe in is taken from different witchcraft practices um I'm what people were calling the collective which at least that was the terminology in the nineties um [laughter]\nAnd what that means is I take things from different practices that speak to me that connect with me on a spiritual level and I incorporate those into my practices\nInteresting interesting our spiritual which in Studio her name is Heather Myers do you go by the name of ...\nWe'll which in Studio her name is Heather Myers do you go by the name of Heather\nModel yeah trying again I don't have um I don't have a spiritual name my name is Heather yeah when I first started practicing when I was younger I did have\nA witch name but I've stopped using that it's ... it's just not practical ... what was that it was Fox glove Fox it's my favorite flower mhm I'm so\nVery good yeah this is interesting now you you basically practice on your own ... you get into the nature of what are some of the things that you believe help you in the spiritual journey as er which uh is is it a\nPrayer is ... talking with people is it burning candles is it a you know doing um you know what would it be that that enhances this spirituality for you\nSo part of it is connecting with nature I'm going out into the woods which thankfully we have a lot of nature around here I live in a dead end street that that ends in a forest or I'm so going up connecting with nature\nAnd then there are you know certain practices that I Do um today's the high holy holiday um and I do follow those ... the the witches holiday so\nI'm Sal in ... I'm ... and ... are the four major ones and then there are certain um other holidays\nThat happened throughout the year as well so what's the ... the the pronunciation of some of those [laughter]\nUm what what what are the names of them again so salad um all Hallows eve Halloween okay ... yeah I'm a lotta people pronounce it Sam hand because that's how it's spelled um but it's actually pronounce selling in Gaelic or set on if you're if you're speaking Scott scaling\nI'm an ... bell pain\nIf you're speaking Scott scaling I'm an ... bell pain maybe on\nWhat language are those were there in Gaelic there I'm In Gaelic yet there no there in the language of the ... all Gaelic yeah which okay alright so Irish Scott I'm In ancient English oh I'm\nSo today is a high holy days which is\nYes so today is the day that which is believe are pagan is in general it's not just which is but many pagan believe that the veil between the dead and the living\nOr spirits and the living is that it ... this is the transition between the light part of the year in the dark part of the year ... so during the night\nUm brought in their own understanding of magic talent to practice and different paths that are out there um there are even more local groups um there are shops\nUm there are even more local groups um there are shops that there's one in um called the robins' nests that I Love ... [laughter] um [noise]\nThey hold besides selling um things that you can actually use to help you practice um books charms candles mugs um they actually hold classes for the invite people who are particularly strong in one area who are experts are no things um or who run\n'em temples or cousins to come in and teach you about the specific thing\nUm so I Do that on as frequently as I can\nUm and then I have friends who are in the community who you know we just hang out and we chat\nRight hum and then everyone is familiar with Salem and there are certainly cousins in Salem who had been practicing for years together that's was\nGoing to be my next question Salem the history there in the sixteen hundreds were several people were pronounced evil we use and they were burned and they were they were killed uh have you traveled to say we'll just see that history\nOh yeah I certainly when I was younger um and I was fascinated by um I've always loved history and culture which led to my studying anthropology um but I the history there I haven't been there\nIn at least over a year um but there's a lot of strong energy there I'm certainly and people who practice\nAnd what happened there was certainly a tragedy those women were ... were not which is um that this type of practice that we consider witchcraft today was not practice and in Salem that anyone is aware of\nMy guest in Studio is a spiritual which there are hundreds and hundreds out there her name is Heather Mars you live in ... um give us a a a ...\nAdel borough um give us a a a comparison of those which is the pagan which is the witches of the wizard of Oz and your type of\nSpiritual which whether the differences and and er how how why do people get so confused about it\nSo start with the film the cinema which I'm so that that type of witchcraft is based off of kind of the historical context\nOf which is being um evil or attack you know worshipping say in and that kind of Christian dogma basically um that and that caused the witchcraft um killings um throughout history\nSo it's kind of based on the film which is we're most used to seeing that that's changed slightly I could I could talk about this for hours\nUm how the which has evolved and send them a I'm basically from the wizard of Oz on one of the worst of all you basically only saw kind of the hajj which\nWhich is the stereotypical which um I Know when I was when my little cousin was younger\nShe came home from school and she said mommy witches are evil\nAnd her mom turned her and she's like Heather's the which which is are\nBad and she just turned our mom she's like I'll be Heather ... but she's not green\nYes [laughter] so you have that kind of um in that you can\nUse a lot of feminist theory there where it's you know basically which is our women with power\nAnd the swimming with power evil\nUm that has certainly started to change in cinema recently I mean you have things like practical magic you've got the movie the television show charmed I'm Sabrina the teenage which you have all of these more recent um be which do you wish [laughter] rather um you've got much more um\nUm you've got much more um modern day interpretations of the fact that it's okay for women to have power\nAnd say okay for them to have these magical abilities and what that means and how they can help people [noise] um so that's kind of the the cinematic approach which has nothing to do with religion\nHas nothing to do with spirituality it's all just\nBeing part of being able to use magic or having power um do you travel a lot of people about\nThis uh um practice of yours or being a which is spiritual which I guess in in in telling folks you know not only friends work means um you know people in the area\nDo you experienced any people shying away from you or is it more of the opposite that they really are intrigued by it and want to know more about\nA little boat it's not like I Walk up to people like Hi my name's Heather I'm a which [laughter] um but I Do wear\nTend to go and some people will notice that um you know it will come up in conversation and a lot of the time it's more\nJust educating people they're like oh what is that you know they get that little kind of back office in and so what does that mean I'm like oh well you know I I worship nature I Believe in God and the goddess versus a single divinity\nAt I practice magic I you know believe in these holidays and they're like I'm like it's nothing different than being a Christian or being Jewish or being Buddhist or Hindu hum with a different\nForm of connecting with the divine five\nOh eight to two Jews searching twenty if\nYou want to know more about her I guess your practice it's not a religion\nAt least for me it's not religious it is very much a religion um witchcraft is a religious but\nBut is it is very much a religion um witchcraft is a religious but your part of it is not yes I don't I don't think of it so much as religious for me because I think of that is being more structured than what I practice um for me it's much more about connecting spiritually\n[noise] um you talked about magic in your practice magic it's not the magic that we see that and I watch watch severe all of a sudden you know it's on the other side of the room but what kind of magic occurs in this or\nA daily exist and so you have with with which\nSo magic for people is often very personal\nUm and what how they view magic and how they experience is very personal I'm so magic for me is a lot about energy and being able to connect with and possibly manipulate energies in order to have a positive result um so\nI can be considered a weather which I'm I connect with the energies of storms and the weather and if I'm feeling particularly strong I can sometimes manipulated I had no ability to manipulate the last nor'easter I'd try it [laughter]\nIt's like really I had to ward off ... or so\nIt's never good to ward off the weather I'm like whether whether it's huge weather's global um so what I Do is I Try to manipulate it to say it would be really nice if you didn't rain today because something's happening that rain would ruin could you rain tomorrow [laughter]\nMindset thing yeah bring your own willpower yes of of mind and try to\nTapping into the energy that that the weather produces\nTapping into the energy that that the weather produces um\nSpirituality a spiritual which Heather Myers you've been to this or you've been in this type of vote for how long again\nI'm over Fifteen Years over Fifteen Years I started when I was um [noise] just when I was about Fifteen or sixteen years old\nWow terrific now tonight is Halloween is a special for you do you have plans and I want to continue in this uh faith of yours is walking a of which which is what what are your plans for tonight\nSo for tonight for me it's all about ancestor worship 'em and honoring my ancestors so I'll be going to my grandparents and my great grandparents graves ho ho hum and I'll be visiting them\nKind of cleaning cleaning them off a little bit bringing them in offering and probably some flowers maybe a pumpkin um my grandparents my great grandparents are all Scottish I'm mhm they immigrated to the United states when my mother was after my mother was born\nUm so I Will be bringing some scotch and some short bred to offer at the gravesite scotch as in the dream oh yeah oh my gosh and it's got to be scotch whisky because my grandfather would not appreciate Irish whiskey\nWell God [laughter] no that'll add a little spice to the evening yeah Mike how are you going to like mix them with water we're\nGoing to I'm going to push them on the grave on his grave and then take a shot myself um and what's the significance of that it's it's just honoring their\nTheir spirits and their presence in my life and how important their ancestry to me is why it's so it's going to be ...\nA root beer you know it's got aboard that showed a\nWould not appreciate um [noise] I might get some\nIt's got to be that showed a grandpa would not appreciate\nUm I might get some ... my grandmother was a big ... drinker so I might get some cream demands to um to give to her and then some ... Scott is short bread 'em and all this has to welcome them\nBack um and welcome them to visit on this night when the when the bills are very thin very thin um and then I have an ancestor alter in my house I'm so I'll be leaving an offering there for them as well kind of connecting the gravesite to the house\nI'm so that they have an easy way they're trying to show this\nPrint reference which is disappearing at this point\nYou know most of the information can find on line I don't say necessarily through ... Google but through valid online databases that the library subscribes to 'em so we were learning more of the traditional reference type of information\nAre currently I Believe if you go to the library school you'd call it library and information sciences ended there'll be a lot more tech into it I'm sure\nThis is a great city\nI'm sure so this is a great a city here in Seattle for oh you are the new director of the great out all of our library located on north main street now that also come encompasses kind of a library network rights Congress\nRight where part of the sale network which is close to Seventy library so once you have a library card to Adel borough you can use any of the sales libraries and requests materials from any of the library so this really opens up a world of opportunities\nRight and ah you were the fortunate ah recipients of this job and I know that uh our mayor Paul hero recommended new and selected you and uh so so far what do you think of the adult borough public\nLibrary or I Love it I was really very impressed with the community I mean honestly prior to applying for the position I wasn't very familiar with\nThat overthrow a but after meeting with the board of trustees and the mayor and then learning about the community and we just finished our two months uh thirteenth actually yes thirteenth annual a big read um [noise]\nI really got to go out and to the community and meet a lot of folks from the schools from the different organizations illiteracy center the lie\nThe Audubon um it's been a great experience that community is very very supportive and really appreciates the library and that ... great place to work in our staff is really unmatched I'm just constantly amazed at how good the staff at the library is\nAnd of course you're taking over for ... in a wonderful job yes and she was in here just a few weeks ago with the big read and that was quite a successful um project and you know so many people got to read this selected material there were so many events or\nIs that something that you've done in other\nAreas was library work with Joan August\nIs that something that you've done in other areas was library work\nWith Joan obviously it's big shoes to fill she's been incredible force here in Edinburgh and I was happy to have her continue on to help with the big read and I hope she continues to do so going forward\nA in southeastern Connecticut we did a similar type of community read it was called one book one region and wasn't through a National Endowment for the arts grant funding but it was\nSimilar in that we all chose the book and in that case it was more of a regional read so we had about Fifteen different libraries and southeastern Connecticut including colleges in schools\nThat all shared one book did programming and invited the author and with Connecticut College is doing the main funding for bringing the author\nI'm I was reading this article about that was published in the chronicle a few months ago and you're just something that really caused a big stir or you you adopted a five year old black and white tuxedo streamed me do\nYes my toe yeah yes my that must've been ... was the cat running around the library there as well as the missing library has a history of library cat so for many years they had a cat named Emma Lee that was very popular and she passed away in the mid to thousands\nSo from the day that I walked into the library there are a number of folks saying we're going to get another library cat can we get another library cat so um I I did some surveys because you want to be careful about allergies and you know other things that could affect people by having a cat in the building\nUm but the overwhelming thought was yes let's do it so we contacted a local shelter and we found ... short for mitochondria 'cause he was found on a powerhouse road and made a conscious a powerhouse\nLaw of the cell we did not name him it came with his name and sure enough he knew his name and ah he's going strong over there at that\nName and they came with his name and sure enough he knew his name and ah he's going strong over there at the\nMystic knowing letter grade I bet you miss him I Do like to visit him on occasion I tried to get in every couple of weeks shore to see how we do is you still live in Canada ... I'm Still commuting from Norwich which this time of year is beautiful how many miles was a sixty five miles in\nA while and you can do it in about more than an hour\nAn hour and Fifteen minutes an hour and a half when there's traffic they've been doing a lot of construction on the six in Rhode Island so that hasn't been too helpful mhm\nYeah I'm noted in this area is being a very slow driver driving my regular job and\nI'm I was actually stopped by the local chief here Agnew for going to show twelve and my husband's street but he didn't give me a ticket I couldn't do that and probably four hours right anyway\nI'm my guest in Studio the new library director Christine Johnson um you oversee a good staff there um how do you get people to go in and utilize ... more than they drew\nRight well we have a lot of our regulars libraries tend to cater to the shoulder population so we have the very young that come for story times and young parents and then we have the seniors I mean that's kind of our bread and butter\nSo to reach the folks in the middle we're trying to do more uh outreach with um we have our ... database of as a free downloadable books that are available twenty four seven as well let me or other online databases we just introduced\nA crafts database that put out by joann fabrics called creative bugs so if there's anything you want to learn to do craft wise you can access that database again you just need a library card but you don't need to physically be in the library um we're going to be introducing a streaming film service later this year called canopy\nAh I think that's going to be very well received by our regular uses\nShe recalls canopy I think that's going to be very well received by our regular uses and hopefully attract new uses as well um you be able to access films a lot of the classic films and criterion collection and foreign films it's\nIt's an interesting collection of films I think will be well received by the community and my goal is next year is to try and do more outreach with our commuter population I know because of our hours it's hard for the commuters to come in so I'd like to do more maybe within the train station either some sort of\nFloating collection or you know we're sort of\nKind of brainstorming that idea right now with my department head and see how we can make that work\nThat would be a great idea in other words bring a mini library around right to the idea that trained Asian that's awesome Christine Johnson the new alber library director is with us here on AM third June twenty W.

of these go there said about the teacher Mr back but he was a great teacher yeah\nBut he talked taught a course about marketing a marketing and advertising in seventh grade really one of them that's a little young for that one of the most influential courses in my life because it taught us just as seventh graders\nAre advertisements they're mostly legalize lying yeah so that was a great thing and then in college and I can't remember this professors name or who's a young guy dynamic\nOne of those young hip cool professors you know the good doctor raiders of but he had a class on marketing and persuasion yeah and God it was scary yeah boy it was scary yeah the techniques people use to appeal to our peace instinct to persuade us\nThat's what that's what works yeah I think I saw a cartoon once the boss says to the applicant everything on your resume here as a lie I liked that welcome to sales\nThere it is\nIs but but it was a scary scary yours because um and then another time I was scared and college was a ... took a debate in class\nAnd I killed in the debate in class killed ... Dr seuss and miss Kelly wanted me to try out for the debating team yeah and that you should of you know this too is that do that one I was playing intramural sports I was a theater major I was in all

class\nThe pro side or the anti side and the people best in the class could win which either side they were debating the merits of the cars\nOr the the moral\nUm justice of the cars wasn't important it was who's better and arguing you know and it was just really really scary you know it is so which I've all human nature yeah which is why not\nWhat you know necessarily as you say ... the issue with facts but seriously it's it's how well somebody says something and how often\nYeah so that was that's very true scary scary Jeff I'm\nThat's why science is taken a backseat so many times over the years\nThere it is there another as they would ... that we need to go ahead yeah I was just going to say that people who believed in science the people who understand science in history they didn't support him\nPeople dumb enough and again that since you shouldn't column dumb as stupid that's not bridging the divide\nI Want to bridge that divide with uh John Case except Puerto a William F

objectively look at what the hell's going on and realized let's see\n... in Germany in the Nineteen thirties would I have been supporting Adolf Hitler or would I had been one of the good and decent people who spoke out against everything he believes and if you're a Trump supporter you have to look in the mirror and say wow what do you know\nIf I took ... way back machine to Nineteen thirty to Germany I'd be yet Hitler supporter gee maybe I should ask them questions about myself so you need to do that\nOr admit I was wrong\nAnd it's tough for human beings to do that is tough for anybody ever admit they were wrong that's one of the unique things about this show is is is one\nOf\nYeah you'll have a bell you admit when you're living that's a huge part of the show is stupid tall he only stories that's one thing when I'm pretty darn rare I make a lot of mistakes as a human being and admit\nTo most of them not all of them but I met the most of them I acknowledge mistakes it's stunning

when the fourteenth amendment is adopted and the and the intention of all Congress or a ... with the passage of the fourteenth amendment\n... so I'm African Americans are going to be um among the first to attempt to volunteer I'm In the civil war era\nTo serve and to support the union army um their view is that this is an extension of their long quest for citizenship that military service service to the nation this capacity might further open the door or make their case I'm for their status as citizens\nUm the thirteenth amendment as we know in Eighteen sixty five will abolish slavery but the thirteenth amendment does not comment on the status of African Americans before the law before the constitution this is still an unresolved question and the campaign to the fourteenth amendment\nIs precisely designed to respond to that long campaign that African Americans have\nA waged it is to um resolve\nAre the kinds of ambiguities the kinds of dangerous the kinds of ... the former slaves face without\nA resort to the status their status as citizens\nAnd so in Eighteen sixty eight um after Congress has um promulgated fourteenth amendment the states will ratify it and for the first time the U.S constitution will provide that all persons born in the United states are citizens of the United states it is a remedy a radical rents\nUnited States are citizens of the United states is a remedy a radical remedy to bring millions of former slaves into the body politic but it is written in a way that gives it a lasting and enduring effect\nWhich is to make every person regardless of race and I might say regardless of religion regardless of dissent regardless of political affiliations make every person born in the United states citizen of the United states\nBut now during the debate over the fourteenth amendment 'cause there are some a relatively small number of scholars who support the viewpoint of Trump's the uh\nThe birthright citizenship has been incorrectly or a interpreted a book that but even then in the debate wasn't there a debate as to whether this is a\nAmendment would expand to people who were or or where the children born here of immigrants\nImmigrants are not what troubles Congress um during the fourteenth amendment debates on what Congress is concerned about when it cars out an exception to the fourteenth amendment for people not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what Congress is concerned about are three things\nI'm One of the children of foreign diplomats who might\nAh incidentally be born in the United states the fourteenth amendment does not make them birthright citizens\nCongress anticipate um the possibility that the U.S would be occupied by a foreign army and in that case the children of soldiers a foreign army would not be birthright citizenship even if they were born in the United states\nThe third category of persons who Congress is mindful of our Native Americans and here um we're in an era where native communities native nations\nUm we're in an era where native communities native nations um continue to exert and to enjoy the independents sovereignty 'em and Congress does not\nInterfere or impose on that sovereignty by wholesale ... native people us citizens that will happen later in the twentieth century\nBut it's just say that no Congress has not thinking about um what today we might term an authorized or illegal immigrants um but it does carve out an exception for persons who are said to be not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and this is the language that I'm a President Trump\nAnd others have seized upon um as they have looked to constrain or curtail the effect of the fourteenth amendment\nWell you know when we were covering the protests around the killing of Michael Brown a few years ago and fluorescent diving you are in Ferguson, Missouri just a few miles down that same road is the cavalry cemetery where Dred Scott was a buried\n'em but I wanted to go beyond the Dred Scott and talk about other cases I you look at and birthright citizens I wanted to ask you about one Kim arc that Chinese American cook who was born in San Francisco and Eighteen Seventy three at the center of a major but often overlook Supreme Court decision regarding birthright citizenship\nUnited States versus won ... tell us what this court cases about who won came our was and why it matters today\nSo I'm One Kmart is essential for understanding where we are today because he is I'm a son of Chinese immigrants born in the city of San Francisco um he appears to be a birthright citizen I think regards himself as ...\nHe appears to be a birthright citizen I think regards himself as such even his his parents um are not eligible to naturalized 'em by what become the terms of the Chinese exclusion act\nI'm so one Kim arc on does business in San Francisco um business between San Francisco and China\nUm he leaves the country in the early Eighteen nineties\nAnd when he attempts to return at the port of San Francisco he like many other people have Chinese descent is detained at the port\nThe economist Paolo Gettys once taught at the University

association here in the United states author of several books including we cannot remain silent opposition to the Brazilian military dictatorship in the United states\nWe welcome you both to democracy now Bruno ... too high let's begin with you in Sao paolo your response to the election of both NATO\nWho won like quite a margin why and what do you think\nIt's a hard to overstate Amy the significance of his election to such a young and fragile democracy such as ours ah [noise] I think if you want for several reasons is very difficult to\n... been points just a single one but I think is the result of many many years of a criminalization of the political class in Brazil uh this is a long time\nComing it's a started a with a big uh operations bigger police the federal police and ...\nWith that being a operations that the police the federal\nPolice and the decision that she already a did in Brazil are but the fact is a mini saw this coming by the political establishment couldn't believe it was possible\nI'm most so NATO also represents a the military dictatorship\nMm nostalgia in the country which is which is pretty pretty strong\nBut I also have to say something that not many\nPeople who are um\nPut on the table which is there is a mess of psychology things are happening here in\nBrazil there is the fact that they left in Brazil is being\nCriminalize and demonize for quite a while\nSo both ... results of many many things\nAh it's hard to pinpoint just one reason\n[noise] an James a professor James screen I'd like to ask you in terms of the impact of the ... elections which did not get a whole lot of coverage here in the United states on Latin America and really that ... a democracy is across the the the world because people forget Brazil is the\nFifth largest country in the world in population it's got more people than Russia or Japan or and so what happens in Brazil really has a big impact\nOr certainly across Latin America because it represents a about half of all the south America's population\nI think that the election and Brazil reflects an international trend that we've been following in Russia in the Philippines in Poland and Hungary and the United states and conservative governments that come to power in Chile and Argentina\nIn the United states and conservative governments that come to power in Chile and Argentina and by the way a and the ... government which I Would consider worse than the Trump Administration\nIs probably going to be a implementing a series of extremely reactionary\nChanges to the country which will see a decline in the Senate of living of ordinary people working class people in addition to attacking the environments are tearing up international agreements\nOr do forests being the Amazon region and a challenging the Democratic rights of eligibility community the women the black moving and Brazil all of which have been fighting for the last Thirty years for full a democratic rights in the country\nI mean here in this country I think a a report said something like Seventy five percent of the Brazilian a ex patriots around three quarters of the Brazilian expatriates voted for\nI'm voting for both NATO that's former army captain praises the military dictatorship attacks gays attacks when and I and then talk about the issue do explain this professor grain\nSo that there's no question that there is popular support from also NATO who seems to be the savior for the country who is going to offer simple solutions to very complex problems his solution to increase violence criminality is to arm all citizens\nAh his solution to a criticisms by human rights activists of the police excessive violence is to eliminate any investigations of a police when they go into a community and shoot to kill\n'em in this regard I think immigrants people who've left the country and other moments um\nFall into the category of those in Brazil who are listening to these ideas of ...\nThose in Brazil who are listening to these ideas bolster NATO has and hoping that they will solve very complex problems are with his simple solutions\nUm the humidity is very diverse in this country I think there are a large number of Brazilians who have been very consistently supporting the fight for democracy in Brazil that have been very vocal about they do remain a minority of the community in this in the United states\nAnd I'm Bruno I talked to in terms of the racial and class implications of this election clearly under certainly under the workers' party for the first time indigenous people and\nAnd are afro Brazilians started to have more rights and more of a tension and services and affirmative action from the government what do you envision happening or under a under ball so NATO\n\nOr have you done a he's not the president a yet but if you follow the less a couple of a couple of days here in Brazil there is a radio violent attacks on ...\n... in a in a D. or Amazon and the fact is that this man made his political career I fighting a very strong and uh aspect of their president in\nHistory which is the oppression of\nThem [laughter] I'm\nI'm ...

this afternoon and this evening only falling back through the fifties into the low fifties late at night\nOr and then as we go into tomorrow the first day of November it's sun and clouds how 'bout sixty in the afternoon pretty good temperature wise\nMostly clear tomorrow night and then increasing clouds late a mild windy day on friday with showers perhaps even a thunderstorm temperatures in the low sixties some rain on Saturday morning and an sun and clouds in the afternoon a drier northwest wind in the fifties sunshine\nFifty on Sunday Sunday the pick of the weekend for Thirteen twenty am I'm ...\nOf course as we did just recently or you can listen to live events and you can watch live events on renewable now that is and you can listen to a great\nShows like Mrs green that have joined us here at renewable now and hello Mrs green up there in Arizona hope you're doing well today\nWant to talk a little bit about [noise]\nArizona hope you're doing well today want to talk a little bit about the event we did with the national Wildlife Federation but first I'm just want to let you know that today we\nHave a guest on that has been in the newspaper quite a bit here in Rhode Island which is where our main studios are beautiful downtown Providence it cut cap office link\nOr John island is director of business development for inventor Julian and better gene is well known in these parts as they are going to be building a very large\nNatural gas power producing electricity plant here in Rhode Island and if you know anything about New England and certainly you do if you've been listening in watching renewable now you know a couple of things have been going on we are taking off and I think everybody's pretty happy\nOr the last of the coal fired plants as the nuclear plants\nI'm however that means we've got a lot of base load to replace and we've had experts on both great experts engineers and so forth who said jeeze I don't know I don't know if we're going to get there with renewables inefficiency\nCould have some brown outs and blackouts 'em and they worry or we don't have certainly an easy means says Michael knows the producer here at renewable now and thank you Michael\nUm we do not have the easy means of ah piping more natural gas in to Rhode Island so it's going to be interesting today as we talk with John about his company about this project about why are the use of natural gas\nAnd certainly what it will mean to the landscape here in Rhode Island Rhode Island of course as part of the New England I sew\nFor power requirements and will that help potentially stall or prevent where we could have some shortages of some of these other plants shut down now obviously or one of the things we're going to talk about\nDoes as some of these other plants shut down now obviously one of the things we're going to talk about is the business of wind and we did a great global town meeting global broadcast last night which was in fact watched all over the world and we want to thank our audience for tweeting in questions\nAnd we also want to think not only\nUm REI which locally helped co produced a but certainly to the national Wildlife Federation and in particular are our hosts last night which was miles grant\nA really want to thank them for doing a wonderful job for ... for clearly promoting the show very well throughout the world and with all their members\nFor providing a lot of expertise because as you look at the business of wind and last night was deep water which is the offshore project the first one certainly here on the east coast of the United states very big project off of block island sound that will produce a lot of kilowatts um we also look at the deal that was struck\nIn Rhode Island between ... and the west Warwick where the turbines are in common trait west Warwick is the off take her in the town of West Warwick is happily starting next year as those turbines start to spin\nThey're going to be the first city or town in Rhode Island to be one hundred percent\nClean renewable energy and they are estimating conservatively but they will say with this fix rate on electricity and they use a lot I think ten million kilowatts a year\nBut they will say between thirty and forty\nMillion dollars her ready for that and amen to that because that has been a town that has struggled they could really use the additional cash flow and so we looked at all of the economics around when why it why it's stalled completely\nOpposite at Cape Wind in Massachusetts and what was the politics behind it and then what\nI'll pick at Cape Wind in Massachusetts and what was the politics behind it and then what were some of the reasons why is it working in Rhode Island and what does it mean to the taxpayers and what does it mean to the utility and to those of us that depend on just really one major utility\nHere in Rhode Island we had additional insight from the developer who's building the turbines in\nCarbon tree and one of the things we should mention is there's this incredible collaboration around clean energy and that includes certainly wind as we look at the German manufacture who is providing all the expertise and and the components\nOf the ten turbines that will be up next year and we also had a great perspective a from a a writer and editor who wrote the book on Cape\nWind we also had in the audience and one of the things I Want to make sure\nWe talk about today is really give a shout out Michael to bill pat note who is you know has been on with us a couple of times is a scholar as a writer is a lecturer is a tremendous leader at the department of environmental management here in Rhode Island in Rhode Island deserves kudos for their\nA coastal work in particular mapping out the ocean and so they could accept these\nTurbines and uh on November So again hopefully you're listening live after the fact that you can find it on line but November tomorrow night what does that November twelve to fourteen said forget Michael er twelve in at PC\nAt uh the auditorium there bill will be hosting a great pedal wonderful panel that's looking at the pope's encyclical on not only not only looking in general it's sustainability but our personal commitment\nTo reducing our over consumption and to protect the planet so we wanted to thank Amy he wrote a wonderful blog in the you can look\nProtect the planet so we want to thank him he he wrote a wonderful blog in the uh you can look at it in the Catholic Digest and it was great seeing him last night and it will be great to be part of the event at PC problem it's college here in Rhode Island\nA and a couple of days so let's turn our attention with all of that said to today's show and again we've been following this it is has been on our site in our main network site at renewable now about this and it was on our blog the good news for Rhode Island\nThat it was that there is a new major power plant being built in a great little town called Virgo Rhode Island and ... got a lot of good things going on well that is being built by energy and it's John island director business development that we are talking to today who has over Thirty years experience\nIn power project engineering development and energy markets just an island is responsible for thermal activities for inventor jeeze development projects in the U.S is experiencing the\nEnergy and utilities industry including roles and business and project development and equipment for Germany project management permitting\nAnd Michael is we always know it comes down to this financing and certainly construction it ... it's one thing to think about it and dream about it it's another thing to execute on it and that will be part of our discussion\nToday with John So Michael was welcome John island director business development to renewable now\nHave you with us doing wonderful thanks very much John where you are enjoying a little bit of rain as we speak today here on the east coast of the U.S which is a which is a good think John I Want to start off our our audience has heard a lot about what's going on in the world of energy including traditional phones\nOf power production above grade management\nTraditional phones of power production above grade management about micro grids and and uh all the new technology around a decision see an energy consumption and so forth um and one of the things that we have talked about\nOpen to the Maya Miguel challenge he lie in the game\nFriends once you get a play because it's always more fun to be active\nTake the Miami

these young men deserve a chance to win right Dominic ...\nSo much for being with us we're talking with John island director development of energy [noise]\nAnd we are talking about his company and we are right now I'm going to jump into the new facility being built in ... as we do that John then obviously we're thinking there's tight supplies natural gas supplies here in New England in Rhode Island so if you're going to build a natural gas fired plant\nAren't you worried about that and do you end up taking it from other than it does it make it more competitive as a drive up the price were just curious why is that a gas plant\n\nThat against my plant [noise] um yeah well certainly we were very concerned about that um they ... proposal is actually to a news the project pay for additional extension of the pipeline a show that it would be able to deliver the gas project\nJets nice um yeah\nSent and would that happen over relatively short period of time so you're you let's say you're facility is built two or three years I'm certain that takes quite a while you can tell us about that and we're going to get into the details of cars are so many good benefits that are going to come out of your facility\nUm can the improvements in the in the delivery system the pipeline happened over the same period of time\nYeah the uh they've proven sort of I find system would be a complete it prior to the project going operational\nOkay so let's get into the specifics why that bowl review\nSite or you know I'm just curious they're unique characteristics about the terrain and the community or maybe some surrounding resources I mean this is a very big and I wanted to talk about this seven hundred million dollar investment um tell us why there\n[noise] they um [noise] one of the reasons that we are attracted to borrow though is that you know in order to locate it gas fired plant you have to look at the gas pipeline\nAnd you look for other infrastructure like the electric transmission lines of the sites that we have as both a buy a gas pipeline and ah adult circuit three forty five ... a transmission line that we're able to connect and to\nShow those those are really the key attributes that lead to locate a power project\nLoon that makes sense when we think about them off shore right it's a difficult\nPower project to do that makes sense when we think about them on shore right it's a difficult transmission bank and back to the mainland and so forth so having the infrastructure make sense I'm sure to right there was a pretty good\nUm parcel of land and you must need some space to tell us about this project what you're going to build how long it will take home which you invest tell us about it\nYeah so it is a a combined cycle project\nUm which is really the probably the most efficient way to produce a large scale power or using a natural gas\nAnd what combined cycle means is it is a [noise] you have a combustion turban the gas sharp and very similar to like a a jet engine on an airplane or that is connected to a generator\nThat produce power and then you take the exhaust the waste tea and you send it through a heat recovery or to generate steam that is will turn sent to a steamed for it so we have the combined make trucks shame turban and the combustion turban or both producing power\nSo we've talked a lot about fuel cells in almost when we hear the description in almost sounds like a big fuel cell but it's a little different I'm guessing\nIs a little different right yeah it's a fuel cells are heaters\nFor more are distributed energy a type applications you they're smaller um you know this this facility has the ability to start off and come up to full oh you don't want a very a short period of time you can rent that up and down and do a lot of different things with it\nUm you know some of which chaff do with a fuel cell\nA and it's also done in a muscle much more cost effective manner a than a fuel cell in terms of its construction costs\nSo how big is it\nA than a fuel cell in terms of its construction costs\nSo how big it is\nA member of the facility will be somewhere between nine hundred thousand megawatts and and the only reason yeah they got that range if you will is that the output is the the machine\nA ... as a function of what the ambient temperature is higher in the winter and lower in summer [noise] um and\nSaid he uses the natural gas uh you know to produce that our\nUm the the L with though it's like well I think it's interesting to me is that the uh the technology that is using is uh there's really been a revolution in in all the all of these machines are able to produce over the past several years\nThere is a civil or by combined cycle unit I'm In Cranston\nUh it's about five hundred megawatt unit headache consists of two gas turbans in esteem turban\nAnd you know as I said that you and it was five hundred big watch this unit is almost close to ... thousand megawatts but it really has the same number of components and it it produces that power you know much more efficiently so you know\nOver the past five years we'll be out with the efficiency have increased dramatically ... using the same number of components\nHow long will it take you to build it to you know how long I did not realize it was a combined a facility and grandson a must have been quieter I didn't see anything on that how long will it take you to build your blood\n[noise] it takes about two and a half years to build\nAnd that's really from the time you start to clearing get permitted to when you combine\nThat's correct yeah from the time you know after we get the part of it so we are able to secure the financing for the project um it's about thirty miles to get that you know up and running\nIs common for your company do you do this in other places\nIt is common for your company do you do this and other places\n[noise] um inventing gee actually were actually more known for our renewable portfolio well one of the ... when our companies North America or we have about sixty five hundred megawatts of wind projects\nOr we're also one of the largest or energy storage system operators and when I say it's about sixty eight megawatts of the energy storage battery storage projects and then we have about a hundred and twenty megawatts of\nSolar projects than we are looking at other you know energy storage and solar projects here in New England um and in Rhode Island\nAnd so for the storage which is very key and you will know something we talk a lot about a and a commercial great are you doing it or west 'cause we we hear a lot about Iowa as an example way too many renewables way to a much supply\nVersus demand at times and they've had they've certainly an issue where they're not able you know there are turned off\nSome of the turbines and so forth um we're we're we're you've done some of the energy storage\nUm we have projects in Illinois a grand ridge is a one of our key a project stay aware we do have a ... and then we added a thirty megawatts of energy storage top rate you know in concert with that facility\nDo you use mostly lithium batteries in it\nIs a mostly what am I on batteries you use for that um there are other technologies out there\nUm and I and I think they you know the market or the the technology if they were still you know rather knew when you're trying to apply it you know at this utility scale\nUm and so you know some of the markets like New England um you know they they are instituting new changes to their camera so that um you know they can

director business development invented managing\nAh they of course are coming to Rhode Island as we are discussing break company done a lot of renewable energy storage and doing a pretty large natural gas\nThe renewables than energy storage and doing a pretty large natural gas that facility in ... Rhode Island\nJohn I'm\nThen as you look at your your company your portfolio the investment you've made\nUm do you continue then to be pretty diverse do you continue to\nInvest heavily in the renewable side do you like doing additional facilities like this like how do you view the the landscape\nAnd how do you know one of the things we're going to talk about towards the end of the shows a little bit more how you how you view the market in general and we will be maybe five to ten years but what is your company's\nWhat are your company's perspective right now [noise]\nUm well our our corporate the vision if you will is really to create a state level and the environment and um you know I think over the long term\nYou know having more renewables is really the goal that we're trying to achieve\nAnd you know even um you know if you get ... or you know ultimate expectation that you have a completely renewable a portfolio throughout the United states and all of that include show some energy storage I think you're still going to need to have you know some sort of a catastrophe\nTo produce power a when you need you know like for the picking project or something like that\nJust because you know the reliability of the electric infrastructure is this critical I mean energy is really a foundation of our economy absolutely so you know you have to have its gotta be reliable Saturday you know they are when you need it\nUm so and and and trying to incorporate George Orwell's I think you know um\nAnd and trying to incorporate Orioles I think you know um people we need to just take a longer term view as to how that just because you know this project is very expensive you know other projects either wind projects solar projects shake now they're they're very capital intensive\nAnd it just you know put them on overnight um you know so you have to have a sort of I don't want to see a gradual approach but you have to take a a [noise] you know a directed approach in order to try to set it up so that you can really get to your goal which is a sustainable energy from the free system\nNo you're you're exactly right and I think even last night as we talked to the c._e._o. of a deep water a big project offshore turbine project wind project here in Rhode Island and and the other experts they really felt as though\nThe fossil fuel would continue in Rhode Island and certainly New England to to play an important role maybe Fifteen to twenty percent\nYou mentioned that you've got peak demand and you've got other times where you want to be able to to turn those things off and on and and they are certainly I'm very competitive when we look at a facility like\nYours as we talk about the border I don't know how much you know about it I'm just kind of in my head trying to figure out your both coming on hopefully\nOn to the grid in the ... and it in the next few years um do they produce a lot more than you I'm In and is that again maybe this combination obviously Cape Wind did not happen it could well you're a combination of additional capacity does that again help us pushed down the road a little bit\nOh I Know I think absolutely a water a Bible age ... charming is the first phase if they bought or thirty five by and watch 'em you know that ... a a you know it fits\nWatch um you know that say I'm\nGoing to say I'm a member a formidable challenge for them to get those projects up and running it because it's just so difficult to you know put ...\nUh you know one of the reasons why they do that is that's where the wind ... um yeah so so having that ability to get that power in and bringing it to the grid is is great\nBut you need something else to help you know you know work with that so that the delivery at power you know throughout the region is shameless\nWilling you make you exactly right he made the point that they're going to get out there to capture the bulk of the energy efficiently and of course in these two there'll be much much bigger and I believe most of that will deliver down into Long Island with a um pipeline or cable I should say then um\nExcitement here from Rhode Island and excitement for ... as your company starts to look at the overall landscape you were just in the U.S by the way\n[noise] ah well right now that's my focus in the U.S shutdown working Canada I've also to drop my career I've done work overseas as well but uh by now my focus as the United states\nAs soon as you look at New England let's take New England is an example do you see where other cities and towns could be attractive weather's capacity issues and\nKind of what is the criteria you mentioned certainly the infrastructure what is their kind of a base criteria that you look at\n[noise] um I think what you do you should try to put these types of facilities you know as close as you can to where the world is um\nAnd you know if you look at you know where most of the law is in New England it's really you know as I set up to the Boston area down in Rhode Island on because you know and that's also happens to be where a lot of the infrastructure is\nOn on the coast you know and that's also happens to be where a lot of the infrastructure is the gas pipelines are where the electric transmission lines are so you know you look at those things certainly um and you also look at you know whereas\nUm you know existing generation that may be retiring in the near term you know maybe perhaps trying to be you know close to that so he can sort of you know fill that\nGap um you know those types of things that that uh that I look at\nAnd how that scenario do again do you do you envision potentially additional investments here\nIn New England yeah ah you know potentially yes yeah uh you know ... you know maybe not in in Rhode Island of you know as I said we're also looking at solar facilities or you know not only in Rhode Island but also in New England and other energy storage facility so we'll we'll be continuing to look at the ... how\nBig could a solar project look like how many ... would that look like\nA typically a solar facility up here in the northeastern age somewhere between five and seven acres to produce a megawatt\nTokyo power [noise] so um\nAnd we will be assembling a lot more than they would you be looking for a fact we've done a lot of my six make so he to June ... went to as an example\nUm we write so and we seem to be contemplating some big ... what would it be would it be five ... would it be ... what would be a facility and and what didn't include storage in your case\nOf the new will now media and that we're seeing today by the audit and grew\nUp in screening customers for life Rhode Island college breach fire and can you be Mason for all of your office parties furniture and by colonial printing all of your sustainable printing needs [noise]\nWelcome to renewable now with your host Peter often\nFor the next hour learn about the greenery side a bit [noise] and now he's your house either opposite thank you so much\nBack every one to renewable now we hope you've been on renewable now that is this week we are not only promoting the one of our own events but we have a great story about\nWind energy and wind development around the world um we highlighted some of the great some of the great sites and some of the things that are very positive around renewables and in particular\nAround when I Want to welcome to Costa handy ... good to see you good to be back on you and I of course they're going to be chatting with Dr David did well he uh with marine affairs College of the environment and life science at you are right Bruce\nLots of talk about as it relates to renewable energy in particular wind and public acceptance\nYour water good work coming out of your eye river or some planning around the wind project and yeah so it will be interesting to have a conversation with them\nThey've got a lot of a series of lectures going on clearly it's a one of the things that's a top uh they're on certainly talked a bit wells team and what they're doing and and it's interesting sets because we're certainly going to talk about how it\nWhat they're doing and and it's interesting because we're certainly going to talk about\nHow it played an important role as you did\nIn the west Warwick except of being an off take her writing going a hundred percent renewable and seeing those click on next year in commentary subtle regard that will be good for us as always going to get a great update from youth thank you very much on some of the things going on\nThat impact either the greater the consumers or certainly the energy space in the environment\nHere in New England and in Rhode Island\nUm and I just want to mention that on Tuesday night I think we might be sold out now I'm not sure we promoted that this week on the site and as always sent out invitations to everybody that is a listener and it's such a subscriber\nTo renewable now so if you're not make sure you're joining us and you can reach us through all the social media as well\nWe are doing a conference we're doing like global town meeting with the world broadcast sets the business of wind in the ocean state than we are so happy to welcome a mile a grant from the national Wildlife Federation director of Kunar communications who's going to be the host\nThat night I'm Jeff of cost ...\nFrom deep water and isn't that an interesting topic always Fred Presley who did such a masterful job in West Warwick of helping to manage ... shoes Americans very much very ... and I think ... part of it is is ecological background right that the M. and so forth\nUm but he is\nPushing west Warwick into this whole new green economy\nBe great to catch up with Hannah\nWho of course until recently ran the renewable energy find a marine and she's working with wind energy development down here in Rhode Island right on the oceans\nAnd of course one of our past gas and we love him\nRight on their shoes and of course one of our past gas and we love him to be a co host as well do you know Robin Whitcomb\nWarmer editor brought I'm almost sure before you get a wonderful job that we've been staying in touch and kind of sharing information and so he\n... as you know we discuss that's right we discuss the books right they are to blame yes and so he is going to bring a great which is fascinating by the way it is 'cause I read it after the fact after we talk to him yeah\nAnd certainly readily available right yeah it is but he'll bring a fascinating perspective I think to the conversation because I like taking a look a deeper look at Cape Wind and have we done things in Rhode Island because since we might get their first right as far as the first major\nOffshore development so all of that of course they can if they can still get a ticket they could be live at the ... headquarters are looking for a great oh I Can't wait the media room we're going to be doing for such major events a year\nHere at our global headquarters in Rhode Island and also of course they will be able to tune in and watch live in ... and and will be reporting on it over the next few weeks so before you and I\nBring on that Dr David ... well we're both anxious to do that and get into this conversation about his work has experience his team and his help in driving positive public acceptance of wind um give us an update\nUs or a couple of things that are of interest right now one is that uh\nUh the public utilities commission just recently issued an order um the electric companies infrastructure safety and reliability plan there I saw her plan which is their prime if they have to do annually with regard to system upgrades to accommodate customer\nNeeds a upgrades to their distribution system and you order a factor\nNeeds a upgrades to their distribution system\nAnd the order effectively in a nutshell said you know you got to go beyond what you've been doing historically and start to think about what improvements are necessary what great improvements are necessary to better interconnect generating customers because although they planned\nOr something like sixty five million dollars of\nOf capacity upgrades in the last round of planning none of them contemplated ah in additional demands of inter connecting customers it was all customer it was all\nConsuming custom okay and so we intervened I actually intervening on behalf of a client or make that argument that you know we need to start thinking about the good of tomorrow\nAnd how we need to accommodate a generation demands as well amen and we weren't although we weren't accepted into the case 'cause we were there were objections from National Guard and the division\nUltimately the commission took that message to heart which would be the public utilities commission yeah ... and so that's a big step forward graduates very interactive greats other thing is is that a recently there have been proceedings overweight filing that you may be aware of it naturally seeking to assess a\nAccess ... on the distribution customers that didn't have associated load\nAnd we've been arguing that point ah also about a new customer charge that they're seeking to implement and seemed to have made pretty good headway and those arguments that commission seems very skeptical of the filing\nSeems likely that we're going to get into a stakeholder process to design a better approach to future or\nCost allocation for the grid in fundamentally address the central question of whether distributed generation has a net cost or in that benefit to the distribution system obviously we would argue that way\nCost or in that benefit to the distribution system obviously we would argue that we are we need to consider the benefits that did she provides to the grid or as part of the equation of who pays what in terms of supporting the cost of\nThat additional the scenes on there wasn't part of that retroactive so if I already was which I Am providing a local energy through solar on our warehouse I was gonna get danger right yeah well\nThe the fear will never applied to to generation that had load associated with it so you wouldn't have been subject to old argument because you do have lower there that you're serving but [noise]\nBut uh for free standing generation projects like the G projects or were noble energy got rejects or public enemy net metering projects like west work is considering that uh is going to do actually\nThe ah you know that would have been a big burden and yes it apply it was proposed to apply to existing projects so you know they would have gone through financing\nAnd everything and all of a sudden have a few that they didn't get dropped on how was that there it's not for the ... commission really didn't like that that was one of the center huge red flag to them\nWas a seems to have driven some of their skepticism my like\nSending a client a A N n voice a year later saying hey I have this additional the you know and it applies to your case they get a hockey stick their head and you're you with that I Would like uh [laughter]\nAt least they'd be tripping you write in a row yeah so it's blatantly unfair so that is really good work now one question and then we'll introduce\nDr big well bring him on\nFind ways of producing a larger share of our electricity more locally closer to home it it provides a greater security of the the energy source in addition to providing more electricity we have our our needs grow all the time for electricity\nAnd then ... actor this climate issue is if people also support renewable electricity sources because of\nThis opportunity to reduce emissions um whether it's a emissions for air quality and health or these climate causing missions and and trying to reduce the the carbon dioxide emissions and so those are\nSome of the reasons I think that people are turning towards these\nAre new energy systems um and looking at those as as possibilities and so that's that sort of the pie in of how I got interested in this is if you're going to look for solutions\nYou often need to understand some of the the social implications as well\nInteresting well I I I actually attended a\nConference call yesterday\nWhere are the union of Concerned Scientists were talking about resilience\nWhere are the union of Concerned Scientists were talking about resilience with regard to power plant\nLocations in threat to her parents most of which are located right on the water because they use so much water and their generation I thought that was interesting a lot of substitutions or within ... as a result of climate\nOr impacting water levels more than ... where are they ... the\nUnion of concerned it's like the gym was based in DC but yeah I can send you the gray prison to the doctor\nMid well we're going to go to break in about three minutes but it gives us enough time for you to tell us about your group and in that process you can tell us why Rhode Island why you are I in is that since we're glad to have you here\nI'm really kind of the main focus your knee clothes and is part of it are you are I kind of stepping up and being a leader in mapping kind of ocean survival and adaptations\nWell I think it's also unfair to finding time to be in Rhode Island in terms of ocean based energy into the provost here you are a few years ago at Fort than negative to try to grow the expertise to the University in that area\nAnd so they um they made a couple of higher last year and I was one of those on the social science side\nAnd then they hired someone in engineering as well just to try to build some of the expertise and found the excitement around death and and maybe bring a little cohesion to people around the university that have been doing this work\nUm and and really raising our profile I'm Around that and certainly the the block island wind farm helps to attract attention to the state around the idea of of ocean renewable\nHow ... around the ocean water\nAnd not just that set but certainly some of the onshore things that we are seeing I\nThink you and I we both agree with Dr bit well it's an exciting time to be here we are in transformation there's a resurgence in Rhode Island we have amazing natural resources we have incredible academia right and you know you are right um I think we have a government and we're going to ask\nDr did well later about government getting kind of accepting or changing around a renewable since so I Would agree with him I think it's a it's a great time to be here give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable now\n\nDo now is being brought to you today by the ... group AARP in creating customers for life\nWhat island college reach inspired and connect WB Mason for all of your office supplies parties furniture and by colonial printing for obvious sustainable printing needs\nTo\nBe in\nThe beginning of a very new field that is really growing will be harder than it is very normal Mars\nWhy am I in my life or\nThere's a tremendous amount of innovation are very excited but in practice what I'm learning here in the way to getting out\nFrom our [noise] we get [noise] sustainability [noise]\nHow to deal with someone who says that's so gay outsmart them this party is like so gay excuse me but did you ladies were gave to me happier excited then it became a word to use to describe\nExcuse me but did you ladies were gave to me happier excited then it became a word used to describe gay people then somehow it came to me dumber stupid which is how huge is used it which is not very nice\nGuy on the football team and super smart to be totally he tough now would only when he said that's so gay do realize what you've said knock it off learn more I think before you speak dot com brought you buy glistening the council [noise]\nHey hey dad I thought you were the radon test guys who has\nBeen easy to paper

R. I. on line and I know there's a schedule there and information about the speakers and it's a it's a really nice so diverse\nMix of people doing different kinds of\nIt's it's a it's a really nice so diverse\nMix of people doing different kinds of of work here on a around the energy issue\nWhich you know everyone has a pretty good deal for house than I feel about this migration away from fossil fuel to tend to lean in green green economy and like your thoughts your personal thoughts generally do you support and you recently came from Michigan um\nDo you support offshore wind um obviously you work and when the marine side what what are the kind of the environmental hazards\nThat you think about and whether the turbines that start to spin um increase those in in in innocence\nAs part of your answer do you see wind here regionally locally as a as a player you know we put our our future\n[noise] so you know ... a personal point of view I you know my background for a long time as environmental I worked as an environmental educator and one career and then a sort of helped people deal with um environmental planning in a in a second career I think if this is my\nMy third career so I I've been interested in the environment all along I think that\nA transition to um different kinds of of energy sources is important for lots of different reasons I'm certainly the climate issue is is one of those and I\nI think you you know you and and I we're we're not alone in this right um society in as as a larger I'm sort of group both here in the United states and and in other parts of the world as well\nAround people why people may be and the wind energy or anti renewables\nMaybe Robert de ... deep into them with regard to that I'm going to cut you off will will pick up I just want to say though is it always um\nThat they are somewhat disinterested sat there they have deep interests than they oppose it for purely financial reasons and I think Bob did a great job of well illustrating that give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable now\nMy name is Jeff and I'm ... I Love ... I Lived there all the kids the in the reading of follow on and brown while they can read on the other side in print you it's just a good way of getting back to the community knew\nThat it should be higher hum I like to report a bear hug no okay well we were building a bonfire and I I saw some like dry brush and leaves around so I said to move the bonfire somewhere else and\nDr Russian leaves around so I said to move the bonfire somewhere else and I don't know where Smokey Bear shows up and hug me\nSo you know what are some wild fire hazards and moved bond fire to a safer location Smokey alright he likes and when people help prevent wild fires and close to home not everybody gets a hug my front so that's very special to get a hug from Smokey Bear\nFelt was him pick guys I told you it was okay\nOkay well congratulations my friend\n...\nThere are many ways to prevent a wildfire learn how you can do your part which Smokey bird dot com\nBoom leave you can prevent wildfires sponsored by the U.S Forest Service ad council and your state forester\nIt began with my big co [laughter] that was my first day of the patient had burgers disease it's a vascular disease brought on by smoking my thing is started to go piece by piece first it was my left leg\nAfter my left leg of us my right leg and so now I'm a double amputee all from smoking my tip to everyone is don't believe that this can happen to you because they can [noise]\nThanks so much for being with us a handy is with us and David did well who is Dr David ... College of the environment and life science we're really getting to the essence of who is financing some of this opposition what is their self\nWill let Dr ... will kind of finish up but I Want to take\nA specific book the Jews and Cape Wind is and I didn't realize it was a little bit dead right now lives in some of their\n... their financing and some challenges alone so finish up that list acted well and then I you know we're going to draw a specific or maybe examples of what's going on with these two projects\nYou should be maybe examples of what's going on with these projects\n[noise] so yeah so what we were just mentioning is this idea that there's a very vocal minority which may have political power who can who can cause obstruction for a process um there's a couple of other different things that you can say\nAre very positive towards renewable energy but that doesn't mean that they are supportive of any renewable energy project there may be criteria for them for supporting a specific project things like the actual design the project or where it cited or even factors\nAround who the developer is and whether they trust them or not management here in\nRhode Island border doctor right is a is deemed to be too expensive and some news\nIt some some views are absolutely concerned about that so prices is one of the other kinds of criteria that people might have for support or or not support um issues around the process to do people feel like the\nProcess for developing it was fair and engaged other people's values and interests or\nThe distribution of of the benefits and the impacts are fair\nAnd then there's a there's another piece that's been getting a lot of attention recently which has more to do with the the symbolic meaning of landscape so when someone lives in an area or they see an area as being particularly special to them um\nThey they identify with that landscape and when you\nAnything that changes that landscape that they consider it a a threat to them personally\nAnd and certainly when you talk about the ocean people have very strong emotional ties to the ocean and you know for for some people putting an industrial use like putting a big wind turbines\nFor some people in ... years like putting up quite undermined is kind of thing that they cherish\nAnd that can be one of the reasons as well and then you tend to get these people go through lots of different kinds of reasons come together to either support or or oppose ... well\nSounds good let's go ahead said that's fascinating thank you very much it's interesting social science So Peter was referring to you know one of the things that by would come goes deep into on his book about Cape Wind is the Koch brothers property in ocean a in oyster harbors uh\nI'm In near Hyannis port a and they're a few in a huge amount of funding into the opposition uh to that project and not only because of their interest in that community\nA which is a wealthy community a lot of whom you know have their fancy resorts there but also because of his interest in the fossil fuel business which is significant as you know so\nBut there's there are other examples I mean I was involved in uh the effort to try to cite a turbine in Jamestown Rhode\nYou know a a very beautiful community uh the the turban was going to go right next to the Newport bridge in over a wastewater treatment plant there so not the nicest part of Jamestown but there there's still people that have significant means that retire to a gym stand\nBuild beautiful houses or how beautiful houses and say\nThis isn't you know I didn't come here to look at the industrial side of yeah there's a lot of our our society I wanted to come here to get away\nAnd uh you know that this comes back to this idea of what kind of sacrifices are we willing to make as people\nTo this idea of your work kind of sacrifices are we willing to move because people in order to serve a larger purpose and that's not something that environmentalists struggle why why don't you bowling answer this so Dr\nThen where are we generally do you think you just talked about it there's a little bit of a dichotomy there seems to be general public endorsement an open and acceptance of of renewables maybe not always win but\nSo what is going to be the driver to get us to where there's high public acceptance\nUm and also do you both believe that the public officials government officials you mentioned the PUC here in Rhode Island that are deciding a lot of these\nCases and trying to balance our consumer demand with energy or availability new you both believes news officials have kind of undergoing what David holes I'm an attitude of change\n[noise] so um\nI'll I'll take a stab person so a few weeks ago I was down at the American wind energy association offshore wind meeting\nAnd as you can imagine there's hundreds of people there who are all interested in this exact question you know what do you do that changes\nUm the way that people are thinking about this and and start the ball rolling so a lot of them are very excited about the block island project and thinking that that can help to change\nHow people think about um offshore wind by actually having an example that people can look at it kind of nice to people from Rhode Island are kind of walking around like rock stars um\n[laughter] um\nBut you know the other places that they're looking is is one of policy and how can you\nYou know the other places that they're looking is is one of policy and how can you use policy of their way of\nCreating markets that will create more incentives for developing these sorts of things ... years even right now in Massachusetts they're working on legislature legislation\nThat would not just create um a criteria for how much of the energy sold in the state has to be renewable but actually putting in um\nUh uh uh uh the\nRequirements for offshore produced wind\nUm energy in to to that so those kinds of policies are a big interests\nAnd one of the reasons why those policies are a big interest as if they want to create what they call a pipeline of projects which is knowing\nThat there is predictably going to be these are large projects that are under construction for a number of years\nAnd the main reason for doing that is that one of the reasons that that people support offshore wind is because they think it's going to bring benefits to the states and the communities in terms of\nConstruction jobs industry jobs I'm In manufacturing\nJobs but you can't attract those kinds of facilities and those kinds of jobs and kill you have a sure and says that there's going to be a market for those materials overtime to they're trying to figure out\n[noise]\n\nWe made\nYou're

there's so many very close to you that that is has health concerns this health stuff going on and but but it's it's something that's on a an on an uptick\nSo whoever it is whether it's you or somebody close it's just them letting you know that they they're they're watching the you know what's going on and I'm a things are getting better\nYeah do you understand that yeah yeah especially with the cat I had a cat\n... well maybe if I hit it off and that just shot a few years ago and the cat Cancun they actually\nActually like to go the cat tank and they like I was sitting in a class with\nA friend

today's segment it's going to be October thirty first Halloween we actually\nAlready folks to for today's segment it's going to be October thirty first Halloween we actually have a the director of education at the ... uh which museum in Salem, Massachusetts a ritual of Christ a ritual thank you for joining us today thank you for having me\nAlready so walk for some of our listeners or maybe the you know this this topic interest me because I was at work one day and a one of my coworkers was explained to me oh have you ever been to the\nThe ceiling which museum and I I have to be honest and then ah so it's more interest than me\nSo that's why I kind of wants to do the segment\nAnd I'm just so the the premise of my the show was the kind of educate our community through interviews and kinda just have a normal conversation kind of educate the same time so for some of our listeners could you just give a brief background kinda on yourself what you do at the museum in kind of overall bio about yourself\nA Philly um so I Am as he said that director of education here at the Salem witch museum I'm I've been working at the sandwich museum for about four years now I started when I was about halfway through college um so I was actually I was just\nGeneral history major haven't quite found may specialization yet and that was applying for a job at a museum then I was looking for just any job I didn't know anything really about witchcraft history just kind of general you know baseline information\nUm I set out resumes to a bunch of uh museums in the area and came in and did an interview here in love her to the museum play ended up staying and\nUm I ended up kind of finding this really interesting ... history that just a guy obsessed with it I think that's actually a very common thing for those of us who study witchcraft history and you just keep finding out more and more and you\nJust kind of cat hold back and can't stop so when I graduated from college um I\nHold back and can't stop so when I graduated from college um I\nWasn't really quite sure what my next step was and I came back to the museum um which I have been working on during school breaks and such and they offered me the job as a director of education and I've been here ever since I'm so as director of education I\nUm I have a myriad of responsibility is but I'm the kind of big aspects of my job as\nThey do all of the training for our staff say make sure that our staff are well versed on sale and history and witchcraft history I\nAnd then working on updating all of our exhibits and that's just a constant project that I think will always be a big part of this job\nI Do all of our educational outreach so I work with teachers and I work with students we do scraping the classrooms so for teachers can't physically\nFirst century is um you know the modern day city of Salem\nAnd Denver's which is our neighbor so but back then it was all considered to be one thing um and there's a lot of tension between the town in the village because the village wants to separate\nThey want their own church they want to be their own you know town they don't want to pay taxes to um you know Salem town anymore and Salem town doesn't want to let them go because obviously they want that tax revenue they don't want to get smaller\nUm and this is kind of this ongoing battle so eventually Salem Village earns the right to have their own church and have their own minister which was a big victory they're still part of Salem but they can worship a little bit closer to their homes\nBut then the village can't agree on who should be their minister so in the span of about you know a decade or so they go through four different ministers which is absurd for this time it was very unusual and they just can't\nAgree who should lead them and again these are pure of it and so their entire life revolves around religion revolves around their minister and their church so this is causing a lot of and you know anger amongst the various inhabitants of the village and people are taking sides people are starting to get\n'em you know very upset with one another and that tension is just building building building\nAnd so finally in sixteen Ninety two they have this minister and his name is Samuel Paris and it's actually in his home that the affliction starts the first two girls start to you know scream and twitch and have essentially seizure like symptoms and they're the ones who first name people in the community as being which\nIs so that's kind of the background of what's going on in Salem and again you kinda just have to remember that the intense psychological pressure of these people are under it um you know in a way makes sense that something like this would happen absolutely\n[noise] you know in a way makes sense that something like that is\nAbsolutely absolutely that's why I like to uh always start when we talk in history I like to start from the beginning kind of give it back on what it's like just to put everything in perspective and I think it helps\nListeners and everyone else ah understand the topic and for those of us are just tuning in we're talking with I'm Rachael ... Chris who is the ... director of education\nAt the Salem witch museum and we are discussing the Salem witch trials interests trying to put everything in perspective right now or if you will be right back and we're gonna discuss more about the trial was considered witchcraft how was that defined and ah we just discuss everything from a to Z so stick around we'll be right back after these messages\nBCC ... colored one oh one will be held on Thursday November fifteenth from two thirty pm to\nFor thirty PM attending students will learn how to apply to any college they will be instructed on the college application process from start to finish attendees will also learn about meeting application deadlines applying for financial aid finding in applying for scholarships right in the college essay and getting college recommendations\nAdopt us kids presents what do you expect when you are expecting a teenager learning ...\nToday I'm going to help parents translate teams play\nNow when a team says something is on sleek it's exactly like saying that's wrapped\nIt simply means that something is awesome [noise]\nOne other one is to be like saying Tony just short as and\nI talked to the mall\nIn other words you might hear is Joe\nJoe ... is a shorter better way to say jealous as in ...

C. S. dot com\nAlready where we're back in Studio ... with a a racial ah Chris who is the director of education at the Salem witch museum in Salem, Massachusetts and then when today's segment is on\nA citizens Halloween I thought it was appropriate to have it on the Salem witch trials is uh having our museum locally in Massachusetts as well uh ... discuss what are we put everything in a you know what I thought it was a great way of putting everything in perspective of the seventeenth century\nAnd I know um you you also just has to be touched upon this as well in that um the ... they didn't necessarily have a specific date but was there a specific\nTrial or or\nYou know what was the beginning of actually someone being accused of a witchcraft in in Salem, Massachusetts\nSo I'm the affliction starts in January so that's when the girls first start\nTo act strangely\nThe actual trials themselves so you know having a court date and so on doesn't happen until June [noise] um there are pre examinations though that go on between January in June where are you know because they're more and more people start tax strangely and start um\nBecause there is more and more people start tax strangely and start um you know exhibiting this very disturbing behavior and people are starting to openly say witchcraft openly say you know it was\nMy slave it was my neighbor was the beggar woman these are the which is you know they had to do\nSome things so they do pre examination hearings where they arrest 'em a couple of people and then it rests arrest more and more and they're you know starting to kind of deal with this on a local level but they can't formally put anyone's through the court system until June I'm so by may\nI'm finally someone comes back from England with a charter so they\nFinally have a new charter and they finally no you know what their laws are going to look like and that you know to some degree it is going to take time to implement those laws\nBut I'm governor Phipps who's the governor of Massachusetts during this time kind of a ranges this emergency court just to deal with the growing number of people being put in prison as which is\nAnd he establishes the court of wire in Terminator which means to here and to determine and this court on starts to deal with the witch trials case as\nMuch as you mentioned to absorb to become a stranger being ... what exactly was um that was the strange he would everyone thought was he was in the exhibit\nSo it's I think the best way to describe it as almost like seizure like symptoms\nSo they're screaming they're pulling up their hair\nThey're throwing themselves around the room there is bite marks appearing on their bodies their um their descriptions of these girls having almost enormous strengths doing things that no one thought they could do like holding a chair\nDown onto the floor when grown men are trying to pull them aside so things like that so the descriptions that you read of these girls\nGrown men are trying to pull them aside so things like that so the descriptions that you read of these girls\nAre you know there are shocking to us now um you know it it kind of seems like\nUm you know they're ... at the mouth there um you know speaking in tongues they're doing all of these things that just seemed demonic\nAnd there are other examples of things like this happening you know in the colonies history or a couple of years before this and Boston there had been another case\nWhere the ... I'm a woman was hanged for witchcraft um and it was a the good when family had their kids were doing the exact same thing we're ... we're screaming we're\nYou know having basically what look what look to us today like a seizure and it was blamed on a woman who worked in their household who was ultimately hangs\nSo this wasn't you know completely unheard of for the pure it and so when the girls started acting like this they did bring a doctor at a doctor came and looked at them but by the doctors medical knowledge of the time\nIt made sense that it was witchcraft or which was the one who is doing it\n... you know that kind of answers my next question I was going to ask what exactly was a witch crap through kind of what the museum uh like with the definition of witchcraft or is it the same as we was during the seventeenth century or is that the term has changed throughout the years\nDefinitely evolved over time and I think people are actually very surprised to hear what witchcraft was in the seventeenth century\nBecause the crime of witchcraft was an entirely religious crime I mean technically in England it's being treated as a um\nYou know as a capital crime they were being hangs like felons but it's religious and not a person was thought to be making a pact with the devil in return for a magical powers and that's the idea of you know which is this person has\nSchool powers and that's the idea of you know which is this person who does the absolute worst thing a person could do during this time and say\nI'm you know turn their back on God and they go to the devil and they asked the devil for health and the devil gives them not jak essentially so that's why I'm you know the girls\nYou know ... like flailing around in the way that they were the idea was is that on the uh which is specter so kind of like a ghost is attacking lemon pinching them and hurting them and they're the only ones who can see it\nUm so they can report what's happening and everyone around them it's kind of just horrified but you know today we wouldn't think of a which as a person who's making a pact with the devil we tend to think of a which\nNow one of the things about this court that really is unusual it had never happened in American history prior\nWas that they allow something called spectral evidence to be honest\nSo essentially spectral evidence was the idea of um a which produces a specter which is like a ghost\nFeel like they have to arrest her so they do\nAnd she goes into a courtroom and she has her trial and initially the jury pronounces that she is innocent and then the girls react so violently to this pronouncement they start screaming\n... to the point where people are worried they're going to hurt themselves and they are hurting themselves um and that the jury decides to re deliberate so obviously you cannot do that in a court system today because of double jeopardy so\nYou can't read try someone after their sentence has already been pronounced\nBut in a puritan courtroom but you know especially this specific period in court room you could and so the jury re deliberate and they come back and they ask her a couple more questions specifically one statement that she made that they were a little unclear on so they ask her to clarify herself\nAnd she just stand silent\nAnd in reality what was happening as Rebecca Nurse was old she was\nIn her seventies or eighties she was quite old during this time she'd been sick for months prior and she'd been in jail leading up to this court proceedings so she's just exhausted she's quite death at this point she can tiny here but not particularly well so they ask her a question and she just doesn't hear them and doesn't respond\nSo the jury takes that as a mission of her guilt they read deliberate and they find\nHer guilty and they execute her so these are all very unusual things up again can't\nHappen today but in the court voyeur in Terminator\nUnusual things were happening and there was a lot of debate among the ministers during this time as to whether or not spectral evidence should be allowed um in fact most of the ministers in Boston felt as though it shouldn't but people again it just kind of\nShows how afraid people worry that they were letting this happen um and eventually\nHow afraid people worry that they were letting this happen\nUm and eventually in October one's twenty people have been executed um public opinion starts to turn against the trials I'm for reasons like Rebecca nurses executed and many people believe she shouldn't have been George boroughs who was a minister\nGets executed which was really shocking because it's a minister could have made a pact with the devil what does that mean so you know people were appalled by that as well so the the public opinion starting to turn 'em the Boston ministers start writing letter these um you know being\nA document saying that they feel as though the trial should not go on 'em and then to make matters just kinda tip the scales governor ... wife is supposedly accused um you know she never goes to trial or anything like that but um as the story goes governor Phillips you know it's kind of shocked and thankful if my wife\nWho I Know is innocent could be accused of witchcraft\nI mean that means other innocent people may have been named by these girls as well and he just mad and the court voyeur interpreter so supportive oh you're in Terminator no longer exists\nUm it becomes very hard to convict someone for witchcraft so another court is\nYou know reconvene in in January that kind of take up all of the examinations again um I Believe something like three or four are convicted of witchcraft but then governor Phipps pardons those people overturns the ruling and at that point nobody else is condemned to witchcraft and nobody else's executed\nYou know um what was what was the ... uh the afflicted with who is there a situation where you want some was a flu do you know how would be pursued by the community were ... they were the punishment\nWe do know how would be pursued by the community or who they were the punishment all too or\nThey never were punished I'm not formally at least so well the trails are going on um the girls are\nYou know they become very useful because suddenly these are the people who can tell you where the which is in the community so many speculate that the reason why so many of the afflicted where these younger girls is because\nYou know these are girls and appeared in society so again to step back into our seventeenth century history book you have to remember the Puritans are ex dream leave restrictive you know their lives are um you know very rigorous very pious\nAnd especially for a young woman you don't have a lot of you know outlets that's not to say that these people are like completely oppressed but you know being a young girl definitely would have not been particularly fun in a period and community so suddenly when adults are listening to you and your voice is important in your voice is heard\nYou know that that is that will never happen to you again in your life so that's probably why so many younger girls start to feel the affliction and whether or not it's a conscious or subconscious choice which is something I feel like really needs to be emphasized because I personally think at least some of them definitely\nAre it's hard to make definite statements but I think not all but at least some of the girls this was not like a conscious malevolent choice this is something that may or may not have been happening\nIf subconsciously they start to realize that they can have their opinions heard and\nValued and you know become important members of the community just for the moment um so there you know so important that even some of the afflicted girls have Salem are brought to Andover which is about a forty minute drive in the modern day so you know by horseback or a carriage you can imagine\nDrive in the modern day so you know by horseback or a carriage you can imagine how much longer that would be there kind of almost higher it out in a way to end over to go find the which is in the end over community so there are so important that they start traveling um and then however once the trials are over\nIt kind of leaves this like gap now um it's not like people believed that um you know these girls were evil or anything like that once the trials that happened there was kind of this\nCommunity wide recognition that something had gone wrong innocent people had died there'd been some sort of miscarriage of justice\nBut whether or not that's like directed at the afflicted girls is up for debate and in fact we actually don't know a lot about what happens to many of the afflicted girls after the trials\nUm we know a couple of things about some of them many of them actually had pretty awful lives after the trials you know have trouble marrying or had children out of wedlock or you know so on and so forth but um one particular girl who was\nIs arguably the most important afflicted girl in the film trials and putting them junior\nWho I think statistically names the most people during the witch trials um sushi years later when she's grown adults\nUm you know wants to become a full member of the sale of village church and in order to become a full member you had to make this profession of faith to your community\nAnd in her profession of faith she says she apologizes for her role in the ... trials now I mean did you kinda have to take that with a grain of salt because she does say the devil made me do it so it's not like she's taking all the responsibility but she does say\nYou know I desire to be you know lie in the dust and be humbled for this I you know earnestly regret what happened and so on and so forth so there is this kind\nEarnestly regret what happened and so on and so forth so there is this kind of\nYou know I'm regret an apology but none of the blame is really on them it's the devil dead at the devil deceived us so and then we don't really know much else because you know there aren't a lot of records of women's lives aside\nFrom there you know marriage is birth and death so aside from that in our profession of faith kind of us really unsatisfying ending", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Attleboro", "day": "31"}
