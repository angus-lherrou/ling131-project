bring a mattress for him down five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five are toll free phone number what happened to our caller our phone number is one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one\nI read was interest or over the weekend\nThat the brouhaha with the Catholic Church has reached another level\nAs you know Pope Francis uh was accused by an archbishop Carlo Maria Guyana ... accused of Pope Francis and a dozen other uh a church officials of covering up for this\nGuy Emma Carrick ... character who resigned\nIn his as a cardinal actually was taken away from them except in his resignation as a cardinal but the pope said right now that he's going to get to the bottom of this thing All right but but at the same time they came out swinging against the guy they gonna let's hear that\nHead of Catholic Church bishops cardinals marked will lead has issued a blistering response to a conservative critic of Pope Francis who accused the pope of covering up sexual predator cardinal\nExtraordinary but it was triggered by the extraordinary accusations of a former ambassador\nSince Vatican expert for the wall Street Journal Francis ex rock regarding retired Vatican diplomat ... knows accusation that the pope knew ex cardinal Theodore ... sexually preyed on seminarians yet did nothing will let describes need those charges against the pope as a quote political set up\nOn a political set up there you know what it knows that they're going back at least Seventeen or Eighteen years the Vatican news early is that the seminarians were complaining about Medicare pressuring them to sleep with him and everybody knew or Medicare molested a seminarians and the boys beginning in the seventies\nAnd everybody talked about the fact day they got invited the seminarians out to his New Jersey beach house that he owned and into his bed out there\nSo and then the pope said just over the weekend that he's authorized a thorough study\nA Vatican archives and to help for a prominent American cardinals advance or church ranks despite allegations of sexual assault\nUh the problem with that is everybody that the uh this study are refers to only to certain documentation that they have or have not so it's a limited investigation\nOnce again you thought maybe we can get to the bottom of this thing with the Catholic Church not so over the Senate bill ... Kay how're you doing Joe [noise]\nGood thing I'm enjoying your show dancing\nI'd like to discuss with you uh where where I'm In the middle east with you one thing I Do agree with you right in that country has changed\nAnd I believe in all honesty it's to the Trump President Trump's polarizing decision we speech\nYou know you you know Joe I've I've heard that before and and and I'm and I agree want\nOne wrong doesn't make two wrongs don't make a right\nOr if he is you know just because a\nTrump may tweak something about somebody that doesn't necessarily make the other side have to come out and be complete jerks themselves about bringing this country down and I see that happening more and more response of on both sides of this thing I had really there's too many tweets out there from the president\nBut I also see too much hate on the left\nAnd I and a and I don't see that much hate on the right I ... a a at all I I I I'm Sorry but I don't I I Do see the fact that there is especially over the weekend that set up of a of Kavanaugh was awful by what they did in my opinion [noise]\nWell you know that is an ethic which I don't think it was done opening fairly well are pretty lame I ...\nI got to run Joe I disagree with you on that we'll talk about that tomorrow I'm In labor I have a good one everybody\nWhen news breaks out we break in WICK West Germany gate God and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan family members of the ... people killed in a limo crash in upstate New York or asking the same thing as investigators this morning white\nAn interesting story from CNBC this morning global deal making appetite his fall into a four year low a mid ... that China trade fears et cetera uh only forty six percent of global executives over the next twelve months are planning to\nBuy or merge with another company which is pretty low in terms of historically what we've seen\nYeah temp down by ... percentage points from a year earlier so that's you know it definitely a dramatic\nShift uh of course you know you have seen a you know a lot of big deals going through the sky Beale Comcast\nComing in to pick them up a bear and Monsanto you know at some point you sort of wonder just how many deals are they're left out there to do I mean I suppose every single day there's some deal to do but you know if we've come through a period of a really aggressive em an a and you know if we knew the answer to this we\nMake a billion dollars you know we'll things are in the economy in the stock market we better twelve months from now than they are now I think you know there's a reason to to have doubts about how much longer kind of the good times we've seen can keep going\nCertainly I mean that that is a risk I ...\nThe the big executive a site in regulation and geo political uncertainty of the biggest risks and concerns they have to deal making\nYou know the other side is some of the theory is hey if you're going to be heading into a period of slowing or you know economic recession you want to be big and you know have some consolidation seeking whether that storm so two sides of the coin but\nI clearly a lot of geo political and economic uncertainty out there and you're seeing this this is one of those early indicators that we see out there you know if people aren't willing to shell out cash for other companies\nThat begins to become a concern when compiled with other issues\nAnd sort of another version of that is are people waiting in thinking some people are gonna get beaten up and the next twelve to twenty four months and you might be able to make better deals in twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nJody not to mention you know probably costs you another one or two percent in interest to borrow the money to acquire these companies now so that doesn't help either\nSwitching gears a little bit away from China uh although probably a lot of these things were a manufactured in China the retailer mattress from going bankrupt over the over the weekend match for him which operates over three thousand stores across the country declaring bankruptcy sounds like ... seven hundred locations going dark almost immediately\nHave you ever seen anybody going into or walking out of a mattress from\nI went into one once ah\nI actually don't remember if it was a mattress firmer one of the new identical other stores that sell mattresses it seems like there's twenty on every street corner that you ... that you see in you know any of the major cities I'm\nA yeah it's it was a weird place or the number of people that are buying matches on line now and the number of expansions that that that this company had done just didn't seem to add up to me yeah it is not terribly surprising that I'm seeing this company going out of business\nYeah 'cause I go by a couple of every day and this got me thinking about I've never seen anybody going into a mattress store and you know these days or what a better product at Fort or it get it delivered to your house lie down on it if you don't like it return it\nYeah so I my my wife bought one of these are on I ... I don't remember which company she use there was a group on deal five years ago we ordered it we actually really liked it but\nThinking about that ... that return process that wouldn't be very pleasant if we had to return it I mean first off you had to hold that two hundred pound box up three flights of stairs into our south a apartment south Boston apartment that was miserable [noise]\nUm and then if we had to bring that thing back down I genuinely don't know how we would have done it ... that that many ... it might have involved a chain saw on a window\nI'm so I see the appeal to bind them ashes on line and clearly a lot of people are doing it because they're sending companies like mattress from right out of business or that actually brings me to our poll questions today which is up on financial exchange show dot com you can come vote I Want to see how many people\nAre not even if you have purchased a matched on but you know anyone who is bought an actress on line because I think you know most of our listeners probably going to say no to this is not a purchase you make frequently but do you know anyone who has bought a mattress on line I'm uh yes 'cause my wife to tend to have you bought a ... you know anyone who has\nOther about ... go right to Jordan's or something like you have less less matched up I was like two years ago I just wanted to Jordan's and they deliver to form and you pay more though I may you pay more for Jordan's mattress then you will on an online retail I I think you can stay thirty forty percent by going for one of these on line

CEO and chairman so they moved up that price target up to sixteen dollars per share that news on that stock has driven the stock price up to about Thirteen fifty seven\nFollowing the reason low they head down at a shoes they got\nAll the way down to eleven twenty seven per share so clearly bumping back up\nOn the other hand you have a few people argue this might just be a dead cat bounce on gee you know stock is bottomed out and bouncing back up a little bit ah we talked at length about the turnover of CEOs a GE and only time will tell if you know anything really changes here\nLooking at broader markets as a whole the Dow which uh open up and down this morning is now up about ten points so just a fraction of a percent S. and P. just turned flat\nAnd NASDAQ slightly down so number of things going on in the broad markets obviously we had a lot of volatility overnight in China following their announcement they're going to be infusing a lot of cash into the economy and then you do have some volatility just being built in around interest rates\nInterest rates continue to climb up let's see what bonds are trading at right now ten year treasury is trading right now at three point two three three it was under three are not a few months ago or most of the summer is trading round two point eight percent that's adding a fair bit of volatility in the markets as well\nAs we know everything's moved off that ten year so mortgage rates are up near ... the ...

pretty\nPretty important I mean they they just built built up their ... their partnership with Amazon so you can buy a lot more\nStuff that Nike puts together on Amazon which is important and they also put the pressure on Amazon to get rid of a lot of the the knock offs that were available on their websites they've done that stock this year is done tremendously well then\nYou know they'd be gone this anger Colin Kaepernick yeah if you're if you're a Nike investor a stock this year started at sixty three fifty it's nearly eighty dollars a share right now a lot of people thought you know that Callie happen next door it was going to be a big big down for the stock but\nHasn't been so far the investors are still very happy with the company has come off a little bit from their hives that

A. comparisons to Donald Trump or who you know came away with a big portion of the vote she did not win the election that Brazil does elections a little bit differently\nThey have a big election with all the uh all the people running and then if nobody gets fifty percent then there's a runoff so we're heading to a runoff\nBut it looks like they're going to be a big shift the power in Brazil\nWell and things are just such a mess down there in terms of you know a level of debt they're up to you know eighty percent of GDP\nIn debt and the government spending I appreciated this until they were this morning two thirds of the budget but in Brazil goes for old age pension is public health care and the payroll of the public sector by twenty twenty that's going to be the entire budget there's no money left for schools roads highways\nYou know it's just sort of out of control so you can see where a a you know a ...\nComes from in terms of people being fed up with a you know getting whacked with taxes to pay for a colossal government sector\nIs a ... I think it's ... a former army captain is pretty much being going up against the the leftist Fernando died and the left working party has been in control in Brazil for I think a decade or more\nA nobody down I ... I spent a fair bit of time in Brazil nobody in their has any faith in their government and rampant corruption for years and years and years\nAnd bad economic pay place right now one exporter Brazil hardworking Brazilians\nSort of look clean my house ... you're right it it's it's it's not a good economy down there and that's it for this hour the financial exchange I coming up we've got a few different guests are ... from the economist and ... road show stay tuned share financial exchange radio network\n[noise]\nThe proceedings are paid for advertising by the financial exchange it does not reflect the views court opinions of the station its advertisers or I heart media\nIs the latest from ABC News I'm Aaron ... there's a\nSome a specific companies that are really being whacked by the uh China tariffs but you know this burning season could give us a sense of the broader economy wide impact of what essentially as a tax on you know two hundred billion dollars worth of stuff that we buy\nTo correct myself by the way markets were flat about Fifteen minutes ago right now the Dow is down about Seventy points as NPR seven\nNASDAQ off forty five points so down and are asking the down about a quarter of one percent the NASDAQ off about more than half a percent that would make a three day losing streak of this comes to fruition so so far pretty rough October uh\nIn addition to earnings though you know the big backdrop that we have other than earnings of the terrorists as interest rates so the ten year treasury yields\nIs now up pretty far above three percent read three point two three three percent on the tenure treasury as we all know that impacts everything that we do know you go get a car loan you get a mortgage any of these things are going to be impacted by the ten year treasury rate and that's been on the move really since the end of the summer\nWell and I was amazed to see it jumped Fifteen basis points last week zero point one five percent um and you know in the in the news the world a bond trading you know that's a ethic 'til you have a move that big and one week and you know as you pointed out have really been around two point eight percent for most of the summer so\nYou know it's one of those sort of bad news good news things because to me the reason the interest rates going up is because the economy's doing well and the fed can raise the interest rate and\nUm you know we're seeing some uh I Would say a for now fairly positive signs of inflation growth\nSo you know uh every uh every piece of economic data you can argue is good or bad\nYeah I mean we did get so we got a a jobs report on friday and Joe's reiterated incredibly low unemployment rate we're down to three point seven percent unemployment a wage growth was up at an annual I's rate of two point eight percent but it's been accelerating so it's the ... two point eight percent but if you look at the last\nQuarter by quarter we've been getting faster and faster here so I think there are some legitimate concerns that the fed has about inflation or as as you see interest rates and that's the reaction is they're moving up interest rates but\nWage growth is the big one that we've been looking at and uh if there's one thing that I think you really need to keep the stock market and the U.S economy afloat for another few years it's going to be it's gonna be coming from the consumer\nIt's got to come from the American consumer make it a little bit more money and spending that money on things like cars like toys like all that ah you know all that useless junk that we don't need but that keeps our economy floating\nSeventy percent of the economy you and me and everybody spending\nA so speaking of interest rates\nA decade you know if you wanted to go buy a new car you can get a pretty sweet deal on financing zero percent financing deals really came about right after the ... the great recession all these car companies said well we got to sell these cars

driving in a pretty good chance you're gonna have to replace that car for six years goes by\nYeah and then you've got a big uh you know or you gets totaled and the honor wander around that\nCar pretty quickly yeah um say those deals are going away if you see is zero percent financing deal on a car uh usually it's for a couple of reasons one that's just something that can't sell any more so\nYou're ... you're still seeing some of these deals on you know smaller size sedan that just aren't selling very well right now you know everybody wants to small SUV sedans just aren't really going to they're

the financial exchange radio network\n[noise]\nSeems to be to me at least a lot of confusion these days about the health insurance marketplace\nNow if you got an employer and you know they're covering your health insurance that's pretty simple it's not trying to not someone trying to figure out what's covered and how much is going to cost but at least you know what you're expected to pay is pretty simple but with the rollout of the Affordable CARE Act and\nThen the you know the changes that were made the Affordable CARE Act a law has been changing over the last few years and now there's these\nAlmost like GAP insurance policy that you can go out there and by short term short term insurance they're you know they were designed to really only cover insurance for a period of three months if you're in between jobs or something like that\nUm but they are now being sold on a longer term basis they can be really cheap you know as much as fifty to eighty percent cheaper than plans available and Affordable Care act but as we're learning is they are you know specifically very different from what we think of as your typical health insurance plans\nI mean they're completely terrible this a story that we're looking at from or CNBC you know ten thousand dollar deductible coverage of pre existing conditions no prescription drug coverage no subsidies or you know you can't renewed them so you go from one provider to another and I get to that\nAnd the story and I said you know why would you even pay for the coverage of the first place it seems like you're better off just not even going totally uncovered\nYou know I think what this type of thing I disagree with you a little bit there I mean what if you really do your research what this is covering you for is somebody that says hey I don't want health insurance but if I have a heart attack I don't want to go bankrupt basically there's a saying if if you have to have an emergency really expensive procedure it's going to cover that\nBut it's in a covered pretty much nothing else as a pre existing conditions you won't even be approved for the health insurance and the first place so don't worry about it\nUm it doesn't cover prescription drugs largely a sky high deductible talked about that a ten thousand dollars ducked doubles\nDoes thing I didn't realize though so if you buy one of these policies and then it expires because they're you know three months policies you can't just go back and buy an Affordable Care act policy if you get rid of one of these policies you have to wait until the open enrollment period\nAh which is actually over one year yeah um the other thing too is there's subsidies available or if you're in an Affordable Care act policy these types do not offer subsidies\nSo you do it it's tough these days you really do need to research this I actually talked to a guy or just last week who is running a small business she had been in corporate America for years\nStarted a small business really you know the the politics of the Affordable CARE Act really rubbed in the wrong way so he just wasn't carrying any health insurance up until that point and it didn't really it it didn't really seem to click like\nYeah I mean if I if I get in a car accident uh if I you know if something like out in a way I'll lose my house I'll lose anything that I have because you know any visit to the emergency room these days costs thousands of dollars um yeah I I hadn't had a client who had a heart transplant\nThe bill to the insurance companies one and a half million dollars wow\nWhat would you do if you I mean if you didn't have health insurance there you're just toast ... and he was in the hospital for two months are all sorts of prescriptions and that's the other thing right you know yeah that's all covered the heart transplant the basic insurance policies but how about all the prescriptions that you have to be on for the rest of your life that and this this health insurance doesn't cover all that\nYeah the interesting to see the the last time we saw at the end of twenty sixteen they're about a hundred and sixty thousand people in America who had a these short term uh coverage plans will be interesting to see the the updated number you know it's just getting to maybe five hundred thousand or or even a million now\nThe penalty goes away now you don't have to pay a penalty if you don't have health insurance so I think a lot of people are going to drop off and it's a big bill ... if if you earn a decent let's say you're a small business owner or your you know just a independent contractor and you make a decent wage you're for you know a decent Affordable Care act policy you're shelling out\nEight hundred thousand bucks a month for just an individual family plan two thousand four hundred yeah it's big big money I get why people don't have insurance it's really really costly but are you really need to think through the implications if you're not going to carry health insurance\nUm folks do you have a trust to protect your assets if not in your closing in on retirement this message is for you\nPlanning for a time it can be complicated so it's
