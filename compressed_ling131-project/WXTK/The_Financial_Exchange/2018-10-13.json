that's going to put a damper on the army so we get that all the board and then what you said that\nWhat the real estate market is so focused on there's been rising rates are that come about\nWhen we definitely seeing a cooling in the market Laurie in John you want to expand on that\nYeah it's basically it was like a switch that went off overnight it you know I'm with the rates going up but it's been very soft\nAlso yeah we've been seeing some of the uh buyers just impacts their buying power and also went back home which the sellers are going to get just because the the buyers don't have as much money so definitely seen them transaction past week\nWhat was what was quite amazing to me is I saw all of these listing prices drop\nAnd it wasn't just one or two it was almost like a little wave that came in and I think people were really evaluating whether position was and here we are we're on Cape Cod it's fall\nPretty soon snows kind of fall and there are a lot of folks out there who don't want to carry that home through the winter because they made their decision to sell either to downsize upsides moved somewhere else or or whatnot but they've certainly made a decision to do something else and who wants to hold the home through the winter time\nRight and these price reductions are starting after thirty days where you know the norm has been more like sixty sixty five so they're they're\nPaying attention I had one situation it's an off Cape situation but uh the folks found a home that they wanted to buy they had they had just lifted their home\nAnd it was two weeks and they did a ... and it was a significant price that because the the you know what they said they said you know we can carry these but we don't want to\nWe don't want to we just want to get on with that life is short you know what I mean and quite frankly I have to say I agreed with him at the at this um with this particular situation\nOn the buyer side they see the price drops them and have to wait a couple more weeks because maybe there'll be another one show that kind of snowballs from there\nSure well everyone is aware everyone does I mean if someone is out there shopping for a ... they know what the differences between what they were dealing with in a line standing in line losing a property versus what's happening right now and that was three months ago yeah it was Lorrie I mean say in a blink\nOr looking at it from the bark at point you're starting to bring the barn for back in the balance we had such a a a dearth of um a supply and an over abundance of fires willing to pay up and now it seems to be balancing there's a lot of getting back to normal\nIs what the fed wants to do a and getting back to normal means that we're going to go up maybe four or five times on the rate rise\nSo I'm your mortgage rates\nAre at the highest that they've been seven years I Believe a slow death is what I read and then a a fact we would've believe John said this which went off and people said well wait a minute\nAh we've got to start lowering our prices refinanced do too much and I see people out of the market so we hope to come back we're going to balance\nWhat the investors in the stock market did and what caused the ten year which we base our mortgages thought\nTo go up to three point two five from three point one five and and that's back where we ended up this week bomb\nWas the fact that the fed is going to make rates in the dogmatic marching fashion all through two thousand Ninety One more maybe in December year and that could get iffy on that December one but\nWe've got more and more and look you got us through two thousand Ninety and then the fed said oh and then two thousand one day we may do two more he said that the last meeting people suddenly woke up and said wait a minute\nSuppose the economy doesn't need and the president last night\nUh has said that maybe um we ought to be looking at the economy now if the housing industry is not doing so well\nIn the housing industry you buy a house you have to buy refrigerators hit by cars got by law mostly I just do that it that there's a lot of things that Dr at my house market the auto market\nWith the rise in rates\nYou have a I think I saw an article where you're paying an average of five hundred thirty dollars a month to buy a car [noise] three years ago that was four hundred and Seventy dollars a month so you're giving them\nThe ability to uh clamp down on the amount of discretionary money that can go in and I'm\nHopefully it'll bring that back in balance as the sellers brings down their prize they um buyers than big years of okay I'm going to be able to keep my job and maybe get a little higher wages and I can afford that but right\nNow we're in a limbo place where nobody wants to make a move and the president is saying well maybe the fed shouldn't make a move 'cause maybe we're going to slow down and our economy\nAnd you don't want to raise rates in slowing the economy or others say no you've got to raise rates now otherwise and she was going to get out of a way but as we've been talking for six months now quote that we can't find that inflation\nRight ... the oil prices and maybe a um than the oil prices but ability for ah ah the\nComputers and the robots and uh other production facilities to decline prices does it does raise the cost of doing business\nMalicious certainly has a significant implication on the stock market which has a domino effect and really on everything else that's out there I\nI think John mentioned it was it you're done that mentioned that the switch suddenly one off I think it was\nI self Laurie Laurie I have a voice than John [laughter]\nI'd rather be voided Febreze thrills [laughter]\nWell that's because they're a great singer [laughter] we should hear I'm karaoke night I\nGot to give out here in the heart\nOf going through through well that's\nOkay um well do you know the other thing too wet is you know people are looking at their four O. one K. is and what the market crashing or you know taking a turn you said Thirteen hundred points reevaluating the second home market as well\nWell that that's true um if we if we take a little longer look of a a this was something that the the economy is doing very well people should not be surprised that there's that perception or not the actual economy\nI liked that word and I liked that one word is left him yeah I Do I ... I think that that's a great definition for\nWhat is going on across the board I think that we need to remember that these rates are still at or under five percent so the average it's thirty year fixed mortgage right now with a perfect credit score\nAnd twenty percent down it's going to still buy you under a five percent interest rate\nAnd so what happened with the feds raising the interest rate is very simple we knew what was coming it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone unless you don't leave your house and you don't listen to television on TALK radio\nBecause it's certainly a a topic that is being discussed across the board every time I Walk into a conversation that's what's being talked about\nSo in terms of what we're looking at yes the consumer prices are\nThey went up a quarter of a percent and if you had a home equity line of credit if you had an automobile alone if you have credit cards that you carry balances when it's going to affect you three fold and if you are\nIn the process of walking around with the pre approval letter looking for your new homes go get it updated because I'm going to tell you right now if you have the home equity line of credit balance of carried on credit cards an automobile alone\nYour point is well taken and remember a home equity lines of credit are based on either a tax assessment or an appraisal and so right now\nGetting a home equity line of credit is something that I recommend for everyone out there and the reason that I recommend it is because you have a line of credit that is available to you if you need it typically if you do not\nUse your home equity line of credit you don't pay for it but it's there if you need it get it while the market values are still they're put in place and just save it for a rainy day\nBoiling soldiers and buyers backers of balance and go back to a more normal market but this does go now to ... not be\nAs much as as worse as much in a new\nPerception and the buyers and realized that the now's the time to move before things get are\nAt this point in time we are looking at a praises going out there and they're still appraising off of last month and the month before\nRight now we're going into a very different time frame and we're going into a slower months here on Cape Cod so when they're looking at that three months if you're in December they're going to be looking at September October and November sales so it may very well be very different [noise]\nAll right well I'm I have another call it looked like the White House\nI thought I thought so he must have been listening to the show again ad that\nWas probably walk the breakfast for boys were over breakfast at ... never saw so many cars in my life [noise]\nCorrect breakfast at Tiffany's and putting on the reds right\nOkay well ... yeah All right see I don't think it's really\n[laughter] than in a state trooper\nGives the nice talking to the good luck every one in um oh through your next week\nWe'll take said thank you for the ... have a good one you're listening to the Cape cod real estate show and will be more ... will be back with more after the traffic information in\nThis\nReport is brought to you by indeed dot com bust scenic highway and sandwich ... pretty decent shape so far this Saturday morning route six West is sluggish right now through province town between shank painter and race by roads and twenty eight solve a bit of a break tap between route twenty five and the born I'm Jackie Murphy with your latest look at Cape Cod traffic\n... ward winning all doctors is growing now is your chance to join a keeps premium ... company moved doctors personally have full time year round positions available compensation is based on his very much more doctors will train the right person\nIf you have a strong work ethic and high standards and work when shift mole the mole doctors today your Bible wheat Marjorie for nine zero nine one set up an appointment some old Dr ...

All right so let's talk about\nReal estate on Cape Cod I'm before now [noise]\nBefore now uh the last I Would say three years since twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen the market was really you know becoming more and more of a seller's market multiple offers homes a supply demand the supply dwindling each year or more um you know price points you know generally under four hundred thousand [noise]\nUm my sense is a lot of the people looking on the Cape are downsizing from their bigger homes or the second home market is still very very good um and then I think we just talk recently with that is that you know the right to continue to climb there's no longer the the thought that rates would come down\nA but yet people are still on the fence\nAnd and again it's not going to be fed rate rise that it's going to have an impact a direct impact it could take on a mind of it's\nAnd that's what we saw this week yeah I think he made a great point that people with a credit card or a balances and equity lines uh each month those have just been tracking up so the buying power has diminished\nBuying power is diminished unless you can consolidate and get your financial situation in order everything can change I can look at a balance sheet assets and liabilities and it's almost like just waving a wand consolidation can change the whole\nScene of finances and people don't realize it until they actually see the numbers and\nWe sit down and we evaluate your individual situation and we can put everything into perspective it doesn't mean you have to do anything but just having the information and that that a very small educational class so to speak\nYou can you can really put yourself into a whole different position and do it sooner than later if again I mean if if the answer to this question\nAre you having a difficult time paying your monthly debts\nIf the answer is yes to that question give me a call the information is free five zero eight two six four four eight zero five so let's talk a little bit about where we were this past year Laurie um where we were seeing lines go lines of people\nAre in front of you know homes that were being initially introduced\nAnd we were seeing bidding wars and we're seeing all this activity going on now what are we doing\nWell you know uh you know the days are market is obviously increased um [noise]\nPeople have a little bit more inventory in the fall market the second homes have come back out on as as in terms of supply a and people aren't rushing into by that that home the first minute it it comes on the markets are now there maybe four or five they can look at\nEven the cash buyers are kind of old and off because they're just waiting to see whether or not there's going to be some more approach dropping out there but there are and one of the strikes on the Cape cod marketers there's a lot of cash by looking for second homes\nAnd and they're just waiting and you know what they see something like they'll buy it but there's not as much pressure and there's not as much pressure to to get in there with your buyers and get them off the market before they get up\nAnd in terms of the cash buyer John I just want to\nJust put a spin on this cash by most of those cash buyers I mean I I Would say there's a good percentage of them that are really going to be drawing out of a savings account or a money market account rather an investment account but then there's that other savvy group of people\nWho have already taken the equity out of the home that they are\nBecause they know that they're going to get ready to take advantage of a cash offer\nAnd they're using something like either a refinance of a mortgage and sticking that money into an account where they're using a home equity line of credit and quite frankly the seller in the realtors typically don't even know that that's the vehicle they're using it cash\nAnd it's mostly you know the baby boomers you know they're the ones that have had a enough time in life to develop enough equity in their home and they're they're looking they're not going to Florida you know they're coming to the Cape oh they're not going to Florida especially now I own my own came through right [laughter]\nOh my goodness that's another reason oh yeah and the cost of that too I mean lord of the taxes and the homeowner's insurance now are just astronomical and these people are realizing that they're coming down on the Cape and they're going to be on a fixed income\nSo you know all of that is taken into account when they're looking at that final home\nAbsolutely and we look to your point we have a lot of second home buyers who have their properties off Cape or out of state and those people are putting their retirement plans together\nAnd not only as far as their employment is concerned but the retirement of we want to settle down we want to stay on Cape Cod we're going to sell our off Cape house and there you go see\nAt will sometimes it becomes a problem even if that's not incorporate it into a a contract it becomes a problem when the appraiser goes out\nWho is appraising the property and sees unequivocally that something's been done and asks or goes down to the town to see if the permit was pulled and closed and it's not their rights and the owners\nIn the past has been on the buyer to go down and talk to the town about permits and a lot of buyers don't do that\nUm and I think what I've discovered is uh and and dealing with insurance companies is they're not going to cover your insurance if the permit hadn't been pulled and the work was shoddy um and there's a fire or problem resulting from that work\nAnd that wouldn't necessarily be on the burden of the cell or it would be on the burden of the fire the buyer buys the house\nAnd the house burned down\nThere could be a problem and ensuring that property they're after is that what you're saying that's the concern that was was was given to us ... and that was from an insurance person who was purchasing house and that was their concern yes so they knew it while they knew the right thing knew what what the situation would be if\nThat were to happen so very interesting so in terms of someone who has done some work on the house and didn't take out a permanent what can they do is there anything they can do\nYou know the only repercussions I've seen is that they need to ah make good and go down in the town and assume that the work was done a\nAnd whatever window of time and uh you know face the music with the building department as to what they're going to do I I've I've had experiences where people have put in a hotel\nRooms in their basements and I've I've seen the town come and tell them you got to take it out mhm [noise] um it's it's the bigger concern is getting behind the walls yeah um so it's it's going to be a problem agreed\nAnd basements they have a lot of issues in a means of a eat grass to means of eat grass and uh did you put a gas stove down there I mean if you put a plug in stove in there it's easy to take out but when you've got gas running downstairs to that becomes a little bit more of a problem\nIn the town doesn't want to talk to you the homeowners so much they want to find the contractor and if the contractor pulled apartment on a hot water heater six years ago they want the contractor to come and close that permit because it was taken out in their name so homeowners don't even know\nThat there is open permits because they're not pulling them well so well sell a\nWhere seller beware I'm going to be due diligence and find out if you did hire someone did they really pulled the permit and I guess the moral of that story might be if you're having work done make sure you see the permit and keep it in your folder ... a good idea that'd be great idea so for those of you out there who\nHave had work done and you don't have access to that permit and make sure there is one and for anybody that is gearing up to have worked on make sure you have that permit and your folder we just solved another problem of the world's yup [laughter]\nBuyer beware [laughter] right exactly\nRight I Know you've got some listings do we have any other topics that we want to talk about before we go to\nA ... you know one I don't know if this has come up lately is a one on wire fraud or it's becoming more of an epidemic or when you go to your closing and you're you the seller want your chunk of money brought a to the table or via wire with your attorney I'm\nIn the past we've had hackers email hackers we all know Facebook attacked everybody gets hacked\nAt some point in time um what we're finding now are ... are experienced lately is that these hackers are are getting so bold that they're actually calling the buyers directly and representing that they themselves are the wiring company\nTitle company etcetera and that there were a change in the wiring instructions are and the buyers are are readily losing a or sellers are readily losing lots of money to wire fraud\nQatar norm is chunk of change that comes to a closing and somehow they figure it out the day of the closing and and so they try to hack it\nAnd I personally seen it you know it it didn't get even close to being hacked but but but somebody was aware of there was a closing and they knew how much money was going to be they knew there was going to be an amount of money transferred and they tried to get\nSome nice things to to consider a if you're dealing with wiring instructions is you know always to personally verify the wire instructions or use only the phone numbers of the contacts that you initially started out with\n'em and be suspicious of emails and phone calls um where they're asking you to update your information uh pertaining to a wiring instruction\nYou know always you know change your passwords on your emails as frequently as you can um an activate that two tier ... often to Haitian of um\nOf your password 'em as much as you can do on your end in order to uh to prevent wiring fraud is this is only helpful for you so\nAnd typically the attorney is is really um monitoring that young and they are in charge and in control of that so if you receive a random call and you don't recognize the name and there's a saying that they\nRepresent that law office asked them simply smack call you back and do not call them back on the number that they provided you call them back on the number that the attorney in the realtor and the lender has provided and reach out to the attorney and say you know is it you know I got a call from your office wasn't valid\nEspecially with the wire up anything that has to do with money\nLeaving your hands are bank account somewhere else just you know make sure it's a valid\nAlthough things are very stressful and it's usually happens on a day or two before the closing so it's a you know one more thing to just bear in mind [noise]\nSo we have Laurie daily gates and John Strong here from Caldwell bank or they are uh the gas in the studio this morning they are working out of the ... office covering what parts of Cape Cod story we go anywhere any buyer would like\nTo see on the Cape ...
