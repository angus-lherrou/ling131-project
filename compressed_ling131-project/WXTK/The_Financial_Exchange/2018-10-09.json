deer any or Derrion or whatever it was All right in the newspaper well this one deer any ah they the column that took over\nIs a has an interesting question out there where she said thousands and thousands of people have responded to the question the question is\nIf you had to do it all over again would you have kids\nLearning whoa\nWould you if you had to do it all over again would you have kids now she sent thousands and thousands of people have responded to this\nAnd let me just give you a breakdown so far of where it stands and I don't know how you feel about it but she said in a majority of the people who have responded about Seventy seven percent said overall yes\nIf they had to do it over again they'd have kids she said an awful lot of people\nHowever the second group of people that responded they said that that if you since you don't have kids do you regret not having kids now is the big ... that was the second biggest you don't have any kids and you don't regret not having any kids\nWhen I was reading a on today's responded she put out there today is responded started the ah of ah [noise] ah that the people who\nParents who have given the chance to start over they would not opt to have any children and the words they have kids right now but if they had to do it all over again I Know kids\nAnd I said I'm sort of laughing to myself hearing this and I said uh I can understand that the parents and said yeah we've had kids we love them we if we did we do it again\nAnd I can understand the people that are saying we don't have any kids right now All right we never intended to have any kids we don't want to have any kids and we don't regret making that decision either now or in the past of not having kids I can understand that\nAnd the one thing that I was looking at is asking the parents this if you you have kids right now if you could do it over again would you have children\nNo nope all set\nAnd I was saying to myself I Wonder how many of them are one young young parents with three kids under for or what you know whether the socio economic\nAspect of things but some of the answers are ... you know I don't I Wish I didn't have any kids and what you want kids know all they do is grow up and hurt you take it from a mother who's grown son wants nothing to do with me\n\nAnother ... woman says yeah I'd love to have kids again but not the same ones that got now\nThey're bad news\nAnother one says I'm sixty nine years old and I wish I never had any kids\nI'm writing was a dissertation about what a pain in the rear my son and daughter have been over the years but I'm not going to bore you with that now the ones that I had two kids one died and my daughter now an adult has a heartache over has been a heartache over and over again I Wish I never had children\n\nAnd the list goes on and on and on about an interesting about people are saying they have kids right now\nAnd wish they and if they had to do it all over again they would never have children because as time goes on as they've seen their kids grow or whatever it might be right that a different circumstances or they would not love they would not want their children\nAnd some say this you may think I'm a bad person but do I love my president to children after much thinking I Would prefer not to have had any\nLittle whoa\nEven though I Love my two kids if I had to do it

number one eight eight eight WICK Ninety five one one a mother said I most definitely would not have children again I have two kids I had two kids who are now middle aged my son suffers from mental illness\nAnd life with him has been a roller coaster he's still pretty much a child I have to handle everything for him\nMy daughter in grandson moved to the other side of the country and I haven't seen either of them for years neither I'm seeing too interested in my welfare or listen to my suggestions or take my advice I've always tried to be supportive but I have to let them fall to up to a point to avoid enabling their dysfunction\nI feel like a bad person for feeling like this and I was wondering after reading this and maybe it's me but I was wondering after reading of this how widespread is this\nAnd I don't know I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist or I don't know but I'm just wondering how many people feel I mean granted an overwhelming number of people three quarters of everybody asking the questions said oh God of course I'd have the the kids again\nYou know I've got to kids now and and uh uh you know of course I don't regret not I don't regret having ... I'd love to have kids again but I was interested in some of the others coming through time in Centerville how do you feel about a time\nIt wouldn't live my life without children\nWere real lucky my wife and I are very fortunate to have two great kids who are doing wonderful in the world we have to re ... editor in laws and to break granddaughters and a life would not be the same without them and I would do it over and over and over again and I believe the reason we are here on this planet\nIs to procreate within reason\n[laughter] within reason [noise] alright time I you know I'm of the time I think and I know my wife and I are too with all the trials and tribulations of the ups and downs and that but there's also a pure joy I think in having children or grandchildren\nAnd ah [noise] ah we do it again also I'm middle ... flights happy [noise]\nThey're they're a big part of it they really are thanks for the call time I'd agree or just interested in the number of people that don't feel the same way I met ... enjoy the day I'll see you tomorrow\nWhen used breaks out we break in when you watch the gay West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nIdiot I'm Stephanie Ramos parking Michael\nSay national grid paying a dividend yield right now of nearly six percent per year and dividends that's pretty attractive but the tenure treasure is paying three and a quarter yeah I Wonder how big how high\nThe CD rates need to get the foreign minister said heck\nWhy am I why am I investing in these companies at\nThe ... at the margin there was a little bit of a difference all the time but like your question is at what point do you crack we go okay collectively let's get out of this stuff and let's go way to fix type stuff\nUh I think that number is in the four percent four and a half percent area and you people might laugh at that but you know what in Nineteen Ninety nine last time we had a robust rock and roll stock market that ended up becoming too expensive\nThe ten year treasury was six point two percent yeah OK up ... and people were not buying the guaranteed six point two they all want to know sucks ... we learned our lesson sure uh so the question now is in the real normal world what is that right probably another hundred basis points higher would be real competition for stocks\nSome more practical examples writer so I have a thirty year mortgage rate locked in at three point eight seven five percent\nOkay I'm very happy with that right when I have extra money I have\nA choice I can invest that extra money\nOr I can pay down by ... those are two of my options I could also to blow it on a nice new car but that's just not me [laughter] but at three point seven five I Would rather invested in the stock market\nOver ten year time horizon I Believe that the stock market's gonna beat out the cost of my mortgage I fight a five percent mortgage that'd be a much tougher conversation for me much more difficult a math equation\nAnd you know what the the the exercise you're doing right now is an explanation of what's going on right now with the stock market because well what you're talking about doing with your with your mortgage you know is what investors every day think about that incremental extra dollar they have to invest [noise]\nWhat do I get to safe what do I get for a risk right and in Nineteen Ninety nine they were all willing to take a risk at any cost and we learned the pain of doing that\nSure right now you're seeing you know the the the people who are very nervous because they're worried that is one of those moments I don't think we're there yet though unless we had a really large quick increase you're going to still see twenty percent earnings get growth yep overwhelm these issues were\nAbout it it's the story of a lot of different markets right you know people are worried about the real estate markets well it's slowing down that doesn't mean it's heading for a crash it just means that prices aren't continuing to grow at seven eight percent per year nationwide\nOr you know when I look at the stock market yeah I I I see some cracks when I look at the U.S economy I see some cracks in the foundation but it doesn't mean that uh\nSuddenly you know suddenly publicly traded companies are just going to start losing money hand over but it just means that well maybe instead of earnings growth growing at twenty percent maybe it comes down to ten or Fifteen Years on\nAnd on top of that there there's another issue I mean you're talking about the overall market which absolutely is true\nWith in the market what we've had and you can understand the complacency that happens\nIf Amazon works in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand sixteen and two thousand Seventy investor just kind of get used to throwing their money at all the companies that worked as an investment now these are great businesses but what we're seeing happening right now is a rather dramatic rotation\nOut of that which we just got used to buying any price ... and into a lot of the really good value that exist in the stock market in places like financials and places like some of these industrial southern overlooked\nUh we're seeing some of the out of favor stocks now doing really well and some of the real high flyers coming down to earth that's a healthy correction yep yeah and we're not even there yet and we're not even there in terms of corruption will socks we're seeing some go dark but others combat that's a nice healthy thing when you get the expensive stuff kind of coming down\nThe inexpensive stuff going up that gets you to a more normal valuation\nYep so yes we have seen volatility yes than as act down almost four percent so far in October but still up twelve percent year to date so it you know we have to keep all of this\nAh in mind and consider the backdrop of what we're dealing with today are right now by the looks of it in terms of the odds it looks like they're the forty one percent probability that the fed raises rates three or more times by the end of June of twenty Nineteen\nAnd that's the big concern going forward I mean look we'll that stopped the economy no no but uh it will take out some access and we can we talk about Pina there is no alternative that's a theme that Barry and I've been talking about for years\nUp there actually is a little bit of alternative and you can now get three percent and next year if we have three increases you know you're gonna be taking a look at that mortgage or you can look at that you know money market account and saying you know what\nI'm not going to be in such a rush to put that money to work and my money market accounts them getting three percent right um that's a competitive return right so these ... and again the ... we should point out that the earnings are increasing at a twenty percent right there and that's very very healthy\nUm I don't want to beat a dead horse on China here but let's talk about this meeting because at least from what I have seen a U.S relations with China while\nVery difficult in ... privately we talk about how bad they are but I've never really recalled a public meeting between us and Chinese officials that was this fraught with contention\nYeah secretary of state Mike Pompeo exchange rather testy words with Chinese foreign minister and he was I thought he the pump a it was actually the the ... one of the two when he was going crazy yeah I mean they're not happy and we we understand that\nA and this is complicating other issues in terms of international relations namely the anticipated summit with North Korea yeah\nSo it's kind of a mess out there and politics is overriding this I mean they're watching our politics and we're watching their situation they\nGot to me that the north Korea issue to me is the only regrettable part of our current policy towards China I pretty much agree with all of the\nMaybe not the cause of Republicans said about the terrorists but the fact that we implemented these terrorists in our sticking to them right now I'm generally a big supporter of because of China's actions around or\nYou know stealing proprietary information you I'm the only piece that the U.S side impact that is regrettable to me is North Korea so unpredictable and we might have been close to wrapping something up there but that that might really take a hit because of these relations\nYeah I mean I at the same time you know we do have a good communication with the north Koreans and and really we can't trust them completely completely if you can't fight the war but you can't really buy these\nAre the fact of the matter is that we have an improving relations with them and they can't be launching nuclear weapons while they're talking to us so that's that's the kind of good news but it's a complicated situation and my fear is that China I've heard rumors that China may be looking to the United states is saying you know Trump is being so tough on us\nWe're just going to suck it up for the next year or so and hope to get someone veteran twenty twenty\nThat's the case we could have quite a stand up I like breaking news Nikki Haley has resigned as UN ambassador according to a source on CNBC that's huge news because she is a rising star is on the national scene\nA and a surprising fries resignation yet resigning as as you went to Vassar\nWhile we're going to cover that story I when we come back we're all going to be talking about the data breach of the week coming out of Google so we'll be covering that story as well stay tuned right here on the financial exchange radio network\nWe want to hear from you\nText you weren't Barry ... six three five six six and let us know what do you think of other stories we discuss your tuned to the financial exchange radio network\nJust literally like a blank page what do I do\nAnd we're people [laughter] the problem that I think what do I know you go to an empty bar you know like I'm the only one in here turn on the game I'll tell you what you might want to like that's where you felt like going to go into Google effectively\nPulled a Facebook and they accidentally released a whole bunch of users' information and now we don't have Social Security numbers and hear anything but name your address employment information a lot of stuff they shouldn't have been releasing\nI think the cause of this quite frankly is you had a failing products so it probably wasn't attracting Google's top to exactly they want to learn and they didn't want to lose a little they have eh so I mean effectively you had this this basically a dorm or the old project they probably didn't have Google's top talent working on it and it was just kind of ignored\nBut the bigger issue they had the data lake that's a problem and they're going to have to address at the far bigger issue is that it was brought to the c._e._o. he met measure the risks and said you know what I Know we'll eat half a million people's information\nBut we're not going to disclose a conscious decision and that is going to bite them because it would ruin our reputation well guess what people have a right to know

Schneider shatter ... Schneider Mr Shater or who you have all seen his papa John's yeah he is he's name is John he invented the company created he\nOwns thirty percent of the company but he got in trouble\nBecause I think it was on a on a a media call he made a third person reference to a um\nA bad word racial slur racial slur ... I don't know if it was a media conference or an internal conference call but nonetheless he was ousted because of that and that was the reason I I've heard that uh the culture of papa Johns was was also part of it yeah but\nUh because I got to believe is more than him just saying I don't think it was Abraham Lincoln referred to so and so as being something that would make you lose your your business literally right out what's happening right now is to see who\nPartners up with John who has thirty percent of the stock\nAnd what happens so that's that's where we stand right now trying on his considered considering a takeover of papa Johns and there's other companies also that could be in the building\nYou know they only Wendy's they own dominoes at one point you know an arby's to I Believe uh this would make some sense that what they haven't dealt with I haven't seen try and dealing with a company in big\nPublic turmoil before you know they haven't they haven't address that issue of a papa John's type of scenario they haven't you know they haven't dealt with the company a lot of these companies you know CBS type of scenario where you're dealing with the c._e._o. has been who has been in the spotlight\nAnd is very polarizing they dealt with you know issues within companies about sales and profits and things like that but not a big\nI Want to start a fight type of story because of the CEOs actions\nYou know and and this is the key point the key point is it's pizza\nAnd you can get decent pizza at a lot of different places or what differentiates you in that business is image an image alone leave that images tarnished\nYou're stuck with a piece of pizza that that anybody can get where ever they want a ... however they want and and the problem the question that the sixty four thousand dollar question is how damage is that brand damaged John's they had a pretty good at that I saw I think\nDuring the super during the football game on Sunday maybe ah with all the franchise owners a lawn they they just knew had clips of ten second clips of a bunch of different franchise owners or a papa John's right basically saying you know that's not us still come to our store a\n... a diverse group of people trying to really put that behind them because that's what's hurting it yeah it's hurting the stock papa John's but it's really hurting the\nFranchise owners and here's the thing at the end of the day we talk about your ... which is which is controversial\nBut you're totally has something kind of proprietary and they're going to have a lot of challenges no question about that but you know they can overcome it by saying we actually have different food we actually have a different presentation we actually have something you can't get out a whole lot of other places\nEvery town has like five pizza shops and so it's going to be a real challenge them but if they can come through this and they had the backing of a company that is really good at the food business and they're part of that chain you know it could work out\nAnd I mean papa Johns was the main reason that I put on Fifteen to twenty dollars so I mean I I'm a big supporter or they weren't around I was I wasn't even bigger supporter at one point you know twenty pounds bigger [laughter] but you could have been an equally twenty pounds bigger with pizza I could've\nOr does or dominoes I could've papa John's is the only one that was on the ah the college meal plan so that that was\nThat for me dominoes just delivered you know two thirty AM college and\nDid that many weekends yeah and nothing to be proud of that mine is I Would take ...

L. N. G. is a player an elegy in all aspects why do you like it in particular\n\nSo Gore's not just the transport from one source but not to do the whole entire budget I've been on your show before and we've talked about how they're developing boating Allen G. I. O. N. G. transport and also import most recently though the spot rate or transports that search\nOf a couple of months ago on a on a show oh she's my mouth but a lot of ... about forty thousand dollars they operate in the last week that there's over a hundred thousand dollars per day\nWow so demand growth is definitely strong we know that and that's that's part of the reason for what's going on do fear though that might be peaking\nOr no not at all I got the uh the biographer of vessels ... twenty Twenty one meanwhile the demand is protected to grow between ten and Fifteen Percent per year going forward so we're actually very polish shot on the for two and a half to three years in fact I think we're just getting started with the tread\nWhat do you see is the upside on this stock and wonder if you talk about their earnings you know a little bit about the financial just you know how healthy they are and and how expensive to stock is\nYeah absolutely so the last quarter or we actually had pretty low bar it's like I was saying they're lower forty thousand dollars out this summer so going forward or the current rates are about a hundred thousand dollars per day so it was just the earnings the sky rocket a the third quarter is going to go up\nI we don't know exactly on the earnings we it's easier to forecast the but the is there's a lotta crap right off the stuff like that\nUm but we should see a ... three pick up a lot or they already raised evident a hundred and fifty percent on the last quarter and they've got it they're going forward as the uh the the docking aged increase that the evidence also increased us I think we'll probably see evidence potentially a as much has doubled over the next year\nAnd a and and as a further transport rates get locked in on longer term charters which is the more stability there\nWhat kind of field is it right now\nBut the hills pretty low on on dealing gee it's more of a gross like OK okay so right now the ... yeah right now the ... only around ... percent ... I'm going for it like I said once they lock in those long term charters though the more\nShe getting an above a money market yield for waiting which which which is nice any other picks in that sector or is this the one company the really like and what are some of their competitors\nYeah so that their main competitor as gas log in both G L O G ... either the main other transport clay and we like them as well but the valuations just aren't quite as good\nAs its back the Gore and oh edgy has more spot stepped on gas locked does and yet it's not really factored into the valuation if you look at the last six months or so of the stock trade of the stock chart you'll see the G log aghast logs already see more of a game in that short another player that we like\nIs that the kale energy partners yeah stock symbol ...\nAnd that's more of a foreign income play although it might or might appeal more to some of the folks that are show their\nExcellence will Jay minutes Myer uh from seeking out for the stock again his goal R. L. N. G. symbol G. L. N. G.

N. G. space\nBut what is you know what are the China trade tariffs going to do to it and that meant that one could impact is stuck so interesting sector to be operating\nAnd I always ask myself what can we do domestically how how how good is this business right here at home and if they're doing really well at home and they make their stuff here we don't have to worry about the ...\nWe don't yeah I I you know ... that may impact prices overall yet or means to be saying that's it for this hour the financial exchange coming up on the next hour we're going to talking about the storm bearing down on

have serious ramifications\nRevealing the incident would likely result in us coming into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed on the radar throughout the Cambridge analytical scandal [noise]\nThis is so much worse yeah this is so much worse than having been alongside Facebook during that issue\nAnd think about what they're saying is Facebook has got a lot of bad publicity\nLet's not get on the way that that publicity now let's just make sure all the bass and listen to this right under the rug is all Cambridge Analytica and all the issues Facebook has let's keep our problems quiet yep on top of the fact that the major technology companies were invited to Washington to discuss issues\nAnd I you know I I'm I defend the government they kept that seat empty Google nobody showed up now and they won't face the music and they have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of privacy and the way in which they regulate themselves it's basically a self regulation
