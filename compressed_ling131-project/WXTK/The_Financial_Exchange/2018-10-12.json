news authority WICK west you're most Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nThe latest on ABC News I found that the remnants of hurricane Michael now virtually all out to sea but leave behind damage stretching across ... states at least eleven people are dead and more than one point six million pages are reported ABC's pecans is in Panama City Florida [noise]\nIt's back to where they needed to be so I think in the short term a lot of this can be resolved if Jay Powell or someone else who knows plugged in with the Federal Reserve comes out and says hey here's what we've been talking about and I know that you were concerned about Jay's comments from a couple of weeks ago but here's what's actually going on now so I think in the short term\nYou can kind of put that genie back in the bottle\nAnd we'll go out in the long run though\nI think the reason why you are seeing a sell off in treasuries over the last couple of weeks\nI don't think those reasons are going away and those ones are the the rising inflation that does appear to be percolating not so much in the U.S at the moment but internationally which eventually it's going to feed into the U.S and also the fact\nThat along with that you've got these emerging economies that are slowing down significantly and that's going to have an impact on the U.S with how tight in all of the supply chains aren't how tied in the world economy is now so those things aren't going away and those are things that are going to be concerns heading into Nineteen\nBut I think that the fed can mitigate it in the short term just by saying hey we said this but here's what we actually match or can we knew a little\nBit of interest rates went to one and why this matters because it's not\nIt's not so intuitive it's not like oh banks went out of business and so the stock market's crashing when interest rates go up specifically the ten year treasury that is what you consider to be your risk free rate and so here is how I tend to explain it to folks which is\nAs investors were making decisions every day\nWe're saying if you're investing in the stock market you're saying I Believe that the stock market is going and going to go up and it's going to go up more than the risk free rate that I can get on my money which\nThese days with a ten year treasury it's about three point two percent so you're saying hey I think that stocks over the long term are going to beat out my risk free rate on treasuries\nAs that number gets higher it's tougher to justify\nSo why do you they you know the thirty five year old who is still working and saying yeah I don't care about the short term long term I'm sure to lead beat out the risk ... says yeah still invest in stocks\nWell the Seventy five year old might be thinking of it differently and they might be saying yeah you know this the stock market has been pretty good to me but I can now go get a CD at my bag paying two and a half percent and that's good enough\nAnd so you've got that going on in also interest rates also changed the pricing on other assets as well that would say that you are Tucker and you are in the market for a home right now and you've been looking at homes over the course of the somebody said gee\nThe thirty year a mortgage rate right now I can get a mortgage at four and a half percent which means I can buy a home worse X number of dollars well if interest rates go up by half a percent effectively cut you're buying power by five percent so that the way the math works let's say that you were originally looking at properties in the two hundred thousand dollar range\nAnd all of a sudden rates go up by half a percent\nNow you're kept out at a hundred and Ninety thousand it doesn't mean that your monthly payment is going to be more than one Ninety versus two hundred but it doesn't mean if you're selling a home the pool of buyers that you have might not be able to afford the way you were originally priced your homes home prices and other asset prices start to fall as a result of that\nSo the concern then is one of the major ways that we grow our economy is through consumer spending largely financed by borrowing if we can't borrow as much we can't grow the economy as much as right that's pretty much what we're looking at their so\nSorry for being a little bit technical and breaking things down to almost a dumb down inversion folks but it helps sometimes they just get some context around why things seem to be falling apart and falling apart so quickly\nThe other minor impact that may have been a factor this week that hasn't been talked about a lot is we're right in that in between stage where the quarter has ended\nBut companies haven't yet reported earning some most of them don't do stock buybacks during that period of time and I don't know how big that impact is\nBut if all the companies that are out there that have been buying back their stock put a pause on that for a few weeks because they're potentially you know insider information problems\nThat can lead to a little bit of you know access ah down selling in that period of time does that worry\nYou in the long term if that's the case here in the short term impact so I look at it actually the opposite way it in it let's say that the market is being kept afloat largely by buybacks and I am I'm not saying it is but let's say the hypothesized that the market was being kept afloat by buybacks okay\nWell when the economy turns down companies stop buying back stock which means that you're going to be a steep herself\nSo it's something that concerns me from that perspective that you know everyone always points to buybacks and says hey this buybacks great it's going to keep the company afloat\nBut what if the circumstances changed so that the\nCompany can't make the buyback anymore I agree with you I just don't think that that is what is actually you know floating up the stock market and is it I think it's just a small piece of things that might have added a little bit of extra volatility on the downside this week but I just I always look at it people say yeah this buyback we'll put a floor on the stock and they go what if the ... like you're assuming that the buyback\nIs going to still be there are some news coming out of China yesterday a China posting a record trade surplus with the U.S in September largely before or the latest round of tariffs went in and really more than anything else I think the signals that a lot of companies were trying to really you know speed up delivery of goods from China to get in before the\n... yeah I mean it was an attempt by a lot of companies that were buying steel that were buying chip processors to skirt around the terrorists before they went into place I\nI Would be much more interested to see what the surplus looks like next quarter\nYeah ... I think the next couple of months are going to be pretty instructive as far as paid we kind of go back to a baseline or\nDo we uh do we now have a new lower number\nThat we are going to see in terms of Chinese exports going into the U.S let's take a break right now and when we come back we're going to be joined by miles oh the one from Yahoo Finance here to get a market update on where things are

more information Mike he'll get a couple a video game companies you take two interactive as well as Activision Blizzard what's moving them\nToday so it really just making up some of the law says that they felt yesterday but these are two companies so Activision Blizzard has gained three hundred and twenty two percent in the last five years take two interactive\n... six hundred Fifteen Percent in the last five years huge gains on these companies and it looks like over the last week they really had been sold off as investors were taken gains um\nActivision Blizzard this month has had declined eleven point six percent through yesterday and take to interactive down eleven point four percent\nIn October through yesterday but as of this morning they're making up some of those losses Activision Blizzard ticker symbol ATV I ended up nearly five and a half percent take two interactive a ticker symbol T T W O up also nearly five and a half percent\nOr so you know making up some of the big

locations\nCoal leader bank at eight seven seven six nine one seven nine zero zero for more information so prior to that break\nWe were talking about the fact that postage rates going up on everything especially in particular the parcels select service the Amazon uses\nFor delivery so this does take us to our poll question of the day up right now with financial exchange show dot com should postage rates for Amazon Go up more than other customers so you can go over to financial exchange show dot com and vote on that\nIf you want to text us your opinion as well just because I like to hear the reasoning behind it sometimes text us at six three five six six and let us know why Amazon should or should not pay more or less than other customers\nSo again question isn't should Amazon Pay more because I think there's a lot of agreement that that the rates probably should go up for Amazon it's whether they should pay more than the other customers for the sand you as a product\nExactly got a by the way so this uh this hike on postage rates would take the first class stamp for fifty cents up to fifty five cents\nA just as a a an interesting little tidbit you go back to Nineteen Ninety One which is the first year that I remember posted traits they were twenty nine cents then glad I bought thirty thousand dollars worth of a forever stamps back then exactly right you don't want the ... was introduced I don't think it was either oh three or ... or somewhere in that ballpark\nUm we do have some tax on the post office anyways uh from nine seven eight the post office do a good deal overseas people pay much more for first class whether that is one hundred percent accurate from Fort won three privatized the post office\nI'm I don't know\nThat I just I don't know if that actually saves any money big problems the post office has had the last few years of trying to get ahead on there a pension payments rather than them losing money just on their service actual you could\nPrivatize the post office you just wouldn't have easy access to postage in rural areas anymore which is kind of the big problem right I mean that's that's kind of been the big issue and the big cost is you know some remote town in Alaska needs to have a post office and that's really expensive\n[noise] what do we talk a little bit about the uh the gas line explosions from a late last month that occurred in the Lawrence area causing all those explosions and fires the NTSB is that with their preliminary report and it does not particularly good for Columbia\nGas it doesn't look particularly good for Columbia gas but honestly this report to me leave so many questions unanswered and effectively what the investigation found was that some work that was being done on a pipe\nFrom the early Nineteen hundreds or they were supposed to the contract and you're supposed to relocate in underground pressure censor from this band pipe and that didn't happen the big question mark that\nIs out there is was this the ... the fault of\nThe contract and that was doing the work was at Columbia gas ... Colombia gases fall because they didn't explain how the project is supposed to be done and how did was there no checks and balances here to make sure that you know something just to be or didn't get followed up on a we have a lot more questions to be answered here\nYeah so pretty much what you ended up with which is what I had originally you know kind of thought was you at high pressure lines that ended up connected to low pressure systems which eventually they do but you're supposed to have monitoring in place so that they don't over pressurized and that monitoring was not present in this\nSo occasionally the justice system works as\nYou wanted to or in this world a lot of times it doesn't but occasionally you get things exactly right [noise] do the two of you remember ah the ah the fire festival from last year\nYes the uh if if you're not familiar with it burning man no uh\nThe fire festival fire being spelled F. Y. R. E. this was the one that was supposed to be on a remote island in the Bahamas that was supposed to be a really exclusive festival and it costs like thousands of dollars to get there because you were supposed to have like a private cabana and they were the food was supposed to be professionally catered and it turned out that they had like\n... houses and literally cheese sandwiches they they just did not plan to sing at all I remember the so it it it turned out that the guy running at this guy William McFarland\nPretty much made the entire thing up and had no idea how to put any of this on ... and so he sold a\nEffectively he defrauded investors of\nTwenty six million dollars twenty ... twenty six million dollars and so this morning or he has put guilty and is sentenced to ... years in jail as a result of a wire\nFraud and bank fraud that's a long time only did was rip off a bunch of millionaires or so of the charge that actually got him in this case\nUm was she wrote a check using the name and account number of one of his employees without authorization that would do it will get you just about every time I also do it I Would imagine he's not actually going to serve all six years I Would imagine it's probably in for two to four\nUm but you know obviously this is one of those cases where it does appear the justice has been served here\nIn this case I mean what I mean he's twenty six years old what does that tell me move it it's not good and uh I don't know if people ended up getting any money back who actually tried to do so under the radar yesterday\nA there was a fairly big bill that was signed by the president uh with regards to music copyright\nUh in giving are just a little bit more protection or as we continue to make deeper inroads into the streaming age as that becomes the primary way that people access music ... what can you tell us about\nThis Mike so there are a number of just strange loopholes that are being closed here a there's a small random things where it seems that I'm for stream songs that were created before Nineteen Seventy two artist weren't receiving royalties those aged dreaming which is just very you know just random and strange so that's been cleared up\nUh there's also it seems like it's also lowering the\nBarriers to entry for somebody knew to get into the streaming game because it allows you immediate access to an entire library of songs or rather than having to go to studio to studio ... so it basically could say you know more competitors could jump into this a lot easier than the apples Pandora's box defies that are already out there\nAnd I think the the big thing here is\nIt eliminates some of the middlemen who may have been able to get in and previously take a cut of this without actually doing anything this allows the artist interface directly with\nUh the publishers here so that you don't necessarily have a middleman descending prices and so forth so I have long been someone who has said that a lot of musicians in the streaming model under compensated and under protected\nThis is not a perfect bill that signed but it gives them a whole bunch of benefits that they didn't have previously in Europe all kinds of artist who have come out in favor of this bill this is a pretty big one\n... it's important to the report on because of\nI don't know maybe two bills that I can think of in the last two years that solves wide bipartisan support so that means that it was pretty just needed to be done\nYeah this this is a bill that had been introduced I think back in April so it took about six months or to to get to the point where it was passed it was passed by the way when we talk about a bipartisan support\nFour hundred and Fifteen to zero in the house and unanimously in the Senate so again this is not something where you had people on opposite sides it was pretty much hey this is something that needs to get done here\nIt's somewhat encouraging that you know they're still something that we can all agree on\nThe uh the the funny thing that you have here on this um is the original sponsor of the bill a is Senator Orrin hatch\nUm and the the idea of Orrin Hatch being the savior of music is a little bit funny you like it just it's not the person that you would expect I Would more expect him to be you know the bad guy from footloose it it's not who you just comes through on this one\nUh in knock this one out of the park so really good news for artist year and again this bill originally sponsored\nBy Bob good a lot in the house and Orrin Hatch in the Senate\nOr in getting through a with unanimous support in both houses here\nBMW is going to be buying out a majority stake in their Chinese a division previously they only on twenty five percent of the joint venture they held over in China is going to be helping that Seventy five percent\nYeah and this is all just based on the laws that were in place and are now changing in China so BMW it sounds like it was only allowed to own a twenty five percent venture in their\nChinese division and based on the new rules that were going to play some twenty twenty two they're allowed to acquire the majority stake of this joint venture now they still need to have a partnership with the Chinese entity up but there are allowed to own more of it you're going to see more of this\nSo it's ... I guess an encouraging changing some Chinese policy but it's still to me doesn't change the core of the issue which is if you want to do business in China you must partner with a Chinese company so that they can effectively you know a skilled trade secrets and at least have access to them\nAnd to give me an idea of how big this isn't what this does mean for BMW ... five hundred and sixty thousand cars in China last year\nWhich is more than the United states in Germany combined yeah so this is a big market for them now I anticipate it's going to get bigger as you continue to see more people in China reaching those upper middle class levels\nSo all the time we have on this hour of the financial exchange but don't worry we've got a whole lot more coming up in just a little bit

of flying he found me then you have an in Orleans or\nUm if you go back to October twenty eighth Nineteen twenty nine again October kind of a trend here okay kicked off really the the Great Depression\nOr with the wall street crash kicking off on the twenty eighth twelve point eight to ... percent so\nThat would be somewhere in the ballpark of around twenty eight hundred points right now and you continue down the list\nYou know it would be we're talking thousands of points here if we saw five hundred yesterday we saw eight hundred of the day before it's not a whole lot of fun even if you combine those two days into one which doesn't make sense because there are two separate days it still doesn't even get into your ... your twenty worst days in doubt Jones his well it's\nThe problems we love talking about the points to the point some of the doubt it's irrelevant the percentages on these things that really are a relevant factor here\nAnd yeah I mean you know a couple of percent has nothing to sneeze at but it's not a huge deal a significant amount or the ... the a circuit breakers by the way if you're a C a seven percent decline that it's a Fifteen minute halt\nThirteen percent decline is another Fifteen minute halt and if you see a twenty percent declined to any time during the day trading shell halt for the remainder of the trading day so not really that possible to have a twenty percent plus market decline\nThese days if you want to talk about volatility by the way we look at what happened in October of twenty nine okay\nI'm ten twenty eight on October twenty eighth of Nineteen twenty nine markets fell Thirteen percent\nThe next day you sit there and say oh gee maybe we'll get a relief rally nope down in additional twelve percent okay so you're pretty much down twenty percent in those two days the following day on the thirtieth bounces back up to twelve percent okay\nAnd then five or six days later on the ... of November back down in additional ten percent so like you you talked about what we're seeing now\nI get it it's uncomfortable if don't comfortable for every one\nThis is all happened before and it's all been way worship so take on that but hey we've gotten through things that are worse will get through this we will okay let's talk about some good news for Social Security recipients getting a to point eight percent boost the Social Security administration announcing yesterday\nBased on the average benefit people receive is going to be about forty dollars more a month in Americans pocket\nAnd the really good is the last time we talked about this uh was last year and there was a pretty big Social Security boost last year or two of the problem was it got eaten up by everyone is Medicare premiums that does not appear to be happening this time Medicare costs are expected to stay in check this year a\nPart B coverage which covers doctor visits and other types about patient care is expected to increase between a dollar fifty and hundred thirty five which is an ex credibly wide range but they're not I know I went down to one thirty five right yeah that's not a range oh sorry one thirty four right now I got it yeah\nI'm poorly written growing up uh fifty ... buck fifty to one thirty five exactly so it's not a huge inflation in the health care costs are surprisingly this year so you're going to really the most of that increase in Social Security which is a nice surprise\nYeah and so again you know for I I Know that sometimes we look at forty dollars and say gee what's that mean for someone for the people who are living just on Social Security which again it's a lot of people I think it's close to forty percent of people\nLive only off their Social Security benefit once they're retired so it's a big chunk of the population\nThat forty dollars a month is real money you know it is something significant okay and so it it shouldn't be pooh poohed I Know people say oh gee it's only two point eight
