yeah um what's happening with morning glories [laughter] what\nI mean I have them growing and a lot of different people's\nProperty yeah beautiful and ... the loaded it can you can start to see the buds but they're not they're not doing anything are they doing the same thing that down as did this\nYear well they shouldn't be they should be starting to flower actually the thing is the morning glories or triggered into flowering by decreasing hours of daylight\nSo so they often don't come in to flower until October\nI mean that's that's kind of typical and it put a specially when they're planted in a place where they have full sun if you plant them in a place where they are getting\nMorning sent an afternoon shade you can get them to come into flour a little earlier because they get those longer nights earlier you know what I'm saying [noise]\nUm but it's it's pretty typical and they also flower earlier and better when they're growing in dry infertile locations\nAnd so if they're growing where they're being fertilized or with their other plants that are being fertilized that will also to lay their flowering\nUm I I made the mistake of planting them once by my roses which of course I was watering and fertilization fertilizing and my morning glories didn't come in to flower until late October one day before hard frost [laughter]\nFunny that's funny yeah health but\nOf some of my friends that were older and they remember them living in the summer and I'm thinking how can this be\nWell they probably were growing them in a place where they weren't in full dead on sun number one number two they weren't fertilizing and they weren't watering very often you know they you you they will come in to flower earlier when they're stressed\nDress them up\nAnd and usually most of us these days we want to help and so we give them fertilizer right which which doesn't help them so\nYou you not fertilizing enough for you okay\nOkay so so yeah I'd I'd if you plant them next year will\nBe sure to keep them you know lean and mean as it were and there they'll come into flour little earlier but still they'll never be in flower you know until it sometime in August just because of the decreasing hours of daylight thing\nHey I I just have a I just want to have an observation I have a fig tree this is a brown tricky yeah and I um I was watching it into the fruit or really tiny and I said oh I'm not this is terrible I'm not watering enough but almost overnight\nIsn't it yes [laughter] that my imagination\nIt is not your imagination that these figs they go from from being small in green almost overnight I agree with you and it's and you will you will suddenly you know you think you're never going to have figs and then suddenly\nEvery morning there it's you know more ripe and it does happen overnight it's bizarre isn't it\nI couldn't believe how yeah they do quick went up there and harvest\nThat tried enjoy those figs if not in the morning glories or called Joanne

gardens next weekend I'm ... and this is news radio Ninety five W. S. T. K. [noise]\n\n\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm On a roll their eyes on the streets of Washington DC this\nMorning [noise] protests near the capital against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but in the Senate it appears that he does have the votes to be confirmed this afternoon White House spokesman Raj Shah\nBut uh this\nWeek the Dow Jones a didn't\nMake another new high back where we were in February\nFinally catch 'em a with other brother is that says the U.S and the five hundred last that [noise]\nAnd um that came about up through Wednesday are being encouraged by a settlement of ah the trade\nDispute with Canada so that the that what the Dow Jones finally up with the other indexes over to new laws but it fell back\nOf the others so we lost about eleven points for the week not very much and we're up seven percent since new year but the last two a\nDay is a said everything down the the us and be five hundred a also up by Wednesday then turned around and last one percent still up eight percent for the year seven point nine\nAnd a stick or which has the Apple Facebook Amazon Google the things that they got hit for it to three point two percent loss for the week which brought there a year to still a pretty good return of twelve point eight but uh the fangs stocks as\nThey're called have boiled them take the profit of been a subject to profit taking here as the markets got higher so a until last week the general market had been rising from February and we've been happy with that there'd be more in March where we live about ten percent down\nOr an onto it didn't and then if you had the ten word for word would be rising\nUh we see why it rising wages\nWays the rising unemployment figures we see I'm of course rising political uh risks\nAnd the military and the trade risk with China but that'll further to the market the rising wages the rising unemployment figures are always\nGive us a figure of ... already a direction of a inflation but last week you know the most important thing was the raising of interest rates by the fed\nTo and this week uh the actual market in the bonds was the thing that the\nTurned around in February look back again Mr market was having a fever and because we're almost done three percent yield\nAnd this week uh we were\nAs high as three point to seven and a ten year yield\nAnd we ended at three point two three but we went up very fast Seventeen percent and we we haven't seen that kind of a rise since the market to go to respect the February I don't know what that that deal more mortgage rates\nThis week at Salem five increase their raped by an eighth of a percent I Know the other lenders had an intra day rate change on Wednesday and they had another rate increase on Thursday\nAnd a few and far between I've been doing this for Thirty years now and I would say it in the thirty year time frame that I have been dealing mortgage financing\nI have probably seen five ... rate changes so that was a surprise because some of my lender friends called me and said did you have an intra day rate changed today and I said now when they did so I was\nA plotting my secondary market back office saying thank you [laughter]\nWell it you know it has been very fast and we've always said throughout the last two years or so we've always said\nThat the bond market will move faster than the ... and and it did mhm and I think when we got to the jobs report which was the biggest news this week\nAnd we saw the rising trend of employment continue even though the numbers didn't know that we're on the hundred and thirty four thousand\nAnd it uh I think we said last week at the end that should have been a projected at one eighty five are still\nA when they adjusted the numbers for August and September\n... of July and August rather than we added Ninety thousand back there was one does that those figures are very good but in we're keeping at two hundred thousand an economist has it affected the uh one eighty five\nBut the rise of wages was still moderate and that's what the people a word excited about west February that wages would go up\nAnd therefore inflation would go up and therefore bonds would go deals with go up it's all fun and so uh it went up\nTo point eight percent over the year it was\nOr ... year to year it was two point nine percent back in August so that's still seems pretty benign so I think Salem was pretty accurate and not a not bumping up the rates and then having to move back down again\nAgreed a newly are indeed in a rate rise market and so one of the things that I Would just like to remind people if you have not already gotten your financial house in water this is a great time to do it\nIn the mortgage rate did rise as a result it did not rise on the same day that the feds raised their interest rate but consumer products like your home equity lines of credit like your automobile on your credit cards those are all increase so you are paying a quarter of a percent more\nAt this point in time and as the feds continue to raise those rates those will be impacted almost immediately to your point and whatever's going on in the market is really going to drive what's going on in the mortgage market but [noise]\nThe uh the the\nReal thing on the horizon is the rates are going to continue to rise it's not a matter of S. anymore it's just a matter of when they will actually make that\nYeah it doesn't look like they're going to be dependent on them that too much because the fed has said yes we're\nGoing forward with rate uh we've got to move the rates up six times before we get to what they consider normal but the bond market will move a lot faster\nA varies they always move ahead and now they are pretty certain that we probably are entering the pill or there's certain last week it could change that we remember Amazon announced they would raise all wages\nYeah twelve dollars to Fifteen dollars ... yes I did\nYeah and so that that meant well it'd be they had to do it after the publicity\nOf a U.S taxpayers funding food stamps for Amazon employees while\nAmazon dot the sales tax of left and right so you had to do something he's made charitable contributions than ours raised that but it sent the retail stores um\nYou know into a problem or eighty thousand people Macy's has to hire for Christmas thirty thousand target the big numbers they're and they're offering twelve dollars this year so immediately the mark and jumped and said look\nWe've got inflation coming a wages haven't risen but now they are not by the government by the uh corporations to compete for employees so fast food chains UPS that is an old\nHourly employees and it turned around and look at what what are we paying now and the states that don't have a high minimum Fifteen so they built a competitive pressure of of competing\nWell I think some one of the most important things that you've mentioned this morning as the bond market will move faster\nKnow if we've been spoiled we've been spoiled for many many many years ... are buying bonds to keep the rates down to the all time low which we were\nWe were very fortunate to take advantage some somewhere very import fortunate to take advantage of\nBut now we're going to see it happen we're going to see the rate rises occurring in a little bit of a different position so the bond market will move it faster than the said meetings so that's something that people really should\nUnderstand we're not going to be waiting for the feds to make that rate rise it could happen in between now and the next time that they meet\nIt'll it could happen as a probably a competitor dislike intra day and they they may be jumped a little too fast ... the current status of the bond market is that people have been expecting rates\nTo rise mhm they have sold short the ten year treasury has one of the largest short positions or where you sell the stock up when the bombs are high and then the bombs so often the ills\nGo up and then you buy 'em back so you'll see you'll go up\nThen people will overrun by back the U.S will go down they'll bounce around in an unusual position we have right now let's\nSay for the next month or so unless you believe the bonds are going up forever which they probably are going back to normal ... percent or so but\nAh it will be very\nRapid your people believe who ah if you agree with me should be checking with you\nAnd if you are you walking anybody in right now\nEveryone is locking in almost immediately at the time about location now at and for how long is that a ...\nWell they can do a thirty day they can to sixty day they can do a nine day the beautiful thing about financing ceiling five bank is we can close in thirty days or less\nA and B voted on and\nUh we believe that it's a a benefit to pass\nThat by law at that time because it would allow a projects to go forward or will allow homeowners that have had certain rights over the last Thirty years or to retain those rights and enabling them to raise and replace a single family or to family residential\nProperty in this just doesn't involve a waterfront property can you elaborate on that a little bit you\nKnow it ah it it's a by law that the effects every every home a piece of property and the town of ... uh by laws are not necessarily get to specific locales ticket to the entire time uh and the one thing to bear in mind is that uh most of the lots in town I suspect\nUh maybe over Seventy five eighty percent of a lot from the town qualify a so called non conforming lots\nOf because as we've seen over the years uh many of these properties where initially developed in many of these homes were built before the towns even adopted zoning so as a result you are then in the sixties and seventies you saw\nMinimum lot size has come in and sometimes those minimum lot size is worth five thousand square feet\nSometimes they were ten thousand square feet and then you saw the five and the ten jumped ten and twenty and then you saw that ten and twenty jumped to twenty and forty and then I think in the town of mastery for example the largest lot size under our by law maybe eighty thousand square feet now [laughter]\nUm but a lot of those by laws are were adopted after most of the property in the town had already been developed\nSo if you're living in a district that has a forty thousand square foot minimum lot size requirement and you're sitting on a twenty thousand ten thousand or five thousand square foot luck you have a non conformity because it doesn't conform to the current\nMinimum required lot size and they also have frontage is which have jumped\nFrom fifty feet two hundred and feed to announce some as as the highest two hundred or two hundred and fifty feet in front of it so uh if you have a non conforming condition you want to do anything with your property a typically you would have to rely on that by law uh to uh\nUh to do it um some have done it by er an expansion of existing dwellings\nOr others have done it by knocking the dwellings down and replacing them because of the properties where so outdated and dilapidated and not conforming to current code requirements that they have chosen to go the reconstruction rebuild\nA road as opposed to a simple alterations are are and they are in addition\nAnd I think I mentioned one last week to show you how it impacts uh every lot in the town I had a client who had who lived on a non conforming law\nThey lived in an area where the minimum lot size was forty thousand square feet they a lot was ten thousand ten to twelve thousand square feet\nAre they at a house on that a lot which didn't conform because at the time that house was built\nA the front yard set back the distance that the house had to be located from the street was only twenty feet now that distance is forty feet so the house didn't conform but they were willing because of the because of the flexibility that they had on the a lot to move that house back\nTo the forty feet and comply with all the other requirements of society I'd really had set back criteria but because they a lot was non conforming\nUh the town has taken the position that they would need to apply for so called variance relief\nAnd various relief is extremely difficult or to secure because of the criteria in it and it and it should be because town meeting has voted certain by laws and you shouldn't be able to\nSidestep those certain by law you have to show hardship you have to show the hardship\nRelate specifically to a site and you have to show that it can be done without a detriment to to the neighborhood or the community as a whole so these folks who had a I think it was around eight hundred square foot home that are the four corners were sitting on concrete blocks are\nOr were unable to a knock that building down or put it on a foundation or make it more liberal or because of the because of the changes in their family and things of that nature uh and and and then had hoped to have a retirement home where their grandchildren could come\nAnd spend some time with them so even though they were going to put it in a position on the lot that was in compliance with even present day was owning a they were unable to do so\nSo Kevin if this passes if if the article is though that yes we're these folks be able to go back to the ... building department in get relief said that they wouldn't be able to move forward with a project like that they\nWill be able to go back to zoning board of appeals and under the proposed by law rather than having to apply for a variance or they will have to apply to the zoning board of appeals for so called special permit\nA zoning board of appeals will examine or the project or to determine whether or not what is being proposed is substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood that currently exists\nAnd they will be able to evaluate whether or not it adversely impacts any of the interests are such as impact on on a surface water flow groundwater a trash a collection a and things of that nature that are all set out in the Bible or as a general under the general special permit\nBy law so they will have to look at all those criteria and evaluate whether or not uh the person's ah can meet those standards so it isn't as if this by law is going to eliminate standards people are still going to be subjected to a review by the zoning board of appeals but those standards have very different than being able to demonstrate a hardship\nA financial or otherwise because if one is knocking a building down then essentially you in some ... some cases are deemed to be creating your own a hardship by virtue of the fact that you're knocking the building down yourself\nSo you can't qualify for the variants relief but they should be able to qualify\nFor the special permit relief under the by law because uh uh as a way of review the project or they can conform to the requirements of the current uh of the Bible relative to the ... of a special permit and buy including the term reconstruction in the by while they should be able to do it or put a\nPut a foundation under that building that conforms to present days owning a be able to properly insulated from beneath and be able to add some additional living space by knocking it down and rebuilding it\nIn a meeting normal checks and balances that would be in place just as they were ...\nThat's correct those those checks and balances on changing\nA you know we have members of the zoning board of appeals who have sat on the board a for a number of years ah in applying those rules and regulations are so it's it's it's not as if these things are being done at a vacuum\nThose board members are familiar with the with the neighborhood involved they go well they visit the property they see what's around the property and the exercise of judgment which they have\nA given the discretion to do under the under the laws in the town\nNow cost it isn't with us this morning he was with us last week he added a lot of value in terms of what the difference would be if this was passed versus if it's not passed yeah give us a timeline to entertain\nThat are just do a summary so that can listening or joining us this week I understand it\nWell I think I'm Kevin I have done a lot of permitting for 'em over Twenty years together [noise] uh right now we have so many projects are that don't qualify for are going forward because of ah this this\nProblem I'm normally when we were designing we know that board of appeals has a um a maximum ... coverage already in place that they enforce that's usually twenty percent uh over ten thousand square feet\nAnd twenty five percent under ten thousand square foot lot\nMost of of of this has to do with the fact that\nI'm Ashby does not have a lot sort of land in fact I'm most Cape Town\nSo we have to go back to the existing homes and try to figure out how to design a home that can fit in to that a maximum existing lot coverage that stays below the maximum height\nOr these are all engineering things that we do so the maximum lot twenty percent\nAgain five oh eight two four six zero three eighty eight please come by it's a gorgeous piece of property\nMarianna these are in Hyannis port yes okay so are these properties forty and fifty six mistreat in Hyannis port and what is the asking price for those properties Marianna\nAh the compound is one million three hundred thousand\nOne million three hundred thousand and if they want to see that before the open house tomorrow argue available to show that to them\nI certainly am I just took a little time other sellers of the salary to are they are to live on the property but yes we're open to if somebody wants to call in the ... come on down\nOkay so if you're interested in that property forty and fifty six mistreat in Hyannis port that compound give Marianna pappas a call five zero eight two four six zero three eight eight thanks for calling in Mariana\nI'm Sorry I I got so excited about this whole thing I don't know if I had mentioned it to their waterfront attendance bond\nYou didn't or didn't name the pond but you did say it was time front but think of for adding that I'm sure that everybody who knows the Hyannis port area understands that those two properties are on that sentence pond but thank you so much for describing him and calling into the show\nWell thank you for taking my call and you have a wonderful day\nAlso too you Marianna okay so Kevin and Tom we're going to talk a little bit about examples of some of the issues that folks who purchased properties prior to this occurring they had purchased a property with a plan to\nRebuild tear down do improvements and now they're kind of caught in this flux you want to talk a little bit about some of those those examples\nYes well I'm you know in twenty six years that I've been doing this I've never been able to tell customers that I Can't do something for them and now I have to be able to tell them that that uh the people\nWho have purchased properties over the last year or two or inherited properties from or their parents come in looking to uh think that they\nCould continue to do things they've done for for that or we're always by rights for all these years and that isn't the case right now until we can get this fixed\nUm uh and hopefully we will on on next Monday but uh you you cannot ah tear down a non conforming structure and start over um\nThat's a simple as it is so for example I have some customers in little neck by who wanted to do something I have customers 'em down near south Cape each want to do something I have a some customers and ... who wanted to do something and then told us gets fixed\nThey can't they can can only tried to renovate a or\nA ad on after this if this does not pass so for example say someone's trying to sell\nA property now and they're real ... or marketing it\nDoes something that has so that this potential or maybe it has a small cottage from the fifties that has no heat 'em\nAnd we know there are a lot of those in\nOther words so they're they're selling the land and that's where the value is ah for the town of ... um ... if you're saying\nThat you have put that it has potential that's simply not true or at least the potential that it used to have so you can imagine how real estate values are going to go down\nAnd the town is going to have to reassess all of these properties are completely because of that land will not be worth a what they think it is or what it is now\nSo it's a people who think they have a potential or they're selling something there or that they put their nest egg into a proper they\nUm ah right now it doesn't have the kind of potential you can't market it that way or you can't believe that you can do all the things that you used to be able to do um since we started in business\nAnd told this article sixteen goes forward and you can imagine the taxes are will go up significantly to try to pay for services and so\nAnd I think it's important really to hit home is that in general when you look at neighborhoods after raising replaces have gone through we create more consistency\nWith zoning after the fact\nUm then before you end up with twenty percent lot coverage on each of these lots many of them are actually conforming to setbacks after they come for them to energy requirements that conform to up to date title five\nAnd septic systems the the foundations or correct with footing and poured foundations are you of insulation ah and ah\nWe're creating a more than a consistent neighborhoods rather than some of these neighborhoods that were never meant to live in year round trail uh\nAnd the people put up what they could afford at that time very simple structures that were never meant to live in\nRight a lot of people just to put them up for a summer cottage right that's right that's what we started out at a a long long time ago summer cottage they didn't plan to a really occupy the property during the colder months so they didn't care\nUp the heat when and\nIf you were a year round to immunity now where people are retiring in pre retiring and ah so\nThis was never envisioned a and I think that uh the other thing that's important to to get through is that this um we have so many\nThings in place to protect\nOur neighborhoods in our community so many parameters\nThat we have to work with already zoning wise environmentally that we have those things in place to the people who are concerned with oh\nThey're building a bigger house there are so many ah regulations already in place are so many by laws that restrict I'm you know out of control development that we should really um support this\nAnd I'm voting yes on this article it will just allow continued improvement for those homes that are out there that are tired and small\nThat is correct and the and it won't have to be done on a piecemeal basis or it can be done and the most efficient a and the most appropriate basis in order to conform to current code requirements\nAnd constantly you hear this term ... mansion thrown out there by folks and as I mentioned to you the the the\nHome that was on the blocks a I think are by the time they went through a in knocking down and rebuilding\nIt still remains the single storey structure they were going to put some bedrooms in the basement to ... to accommodate and the building itself was it was less than two thousand square feet so hardly ever not every building\nA if one considers what a mic mansion is I'm not even sure how you define it but not every building is the Taj Mahal I mean people want to go in and they want to make things\nMore livable and more suitable for their family situation and some of these older buildings I'm not even sure they would withstand the ability to lift them a all at once without creating structural damage and things like\nThat I was going to say that Kevin only we're reviewing it earlier I mean some of them are very tired as Iran listing them I mean unless you have a platform underneath that covers the entire foundation or bottom of that structure you know where you're\nLifting you're lifting a tempers that are from the\nFifties and sixties because we've we've done that in other words where you go in and the whole house basically is was built to know standard absolutely\nNon walls don't even go up or to the ceiling um that you have to buy six are as a choice versus a two by ten so there's nothing there to save\n'em I think people need to understand that we do this for a reason to make things better there's no desire to um do anything that isn't good for the community or the neighborhood\nSo we're getting to the end of the program do you want to advise listeners Monday a week from this Monday go and vote and those yes yes\nWe need you and I were actually voting on this week from Monday as a as a high school at seven PM article sixteen\nFor yourselves for your family your needs to show up and you need to raise their hand and say yes we like the way our rights have
