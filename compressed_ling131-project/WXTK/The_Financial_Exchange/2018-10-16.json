west you are much Cape Cod and I urge radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nNow conference today and Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a reporter at the Saudi consulate in scandal turkey ears ABC senior national correspondent Terry Moran\nAt some point normalize world when our debt gets out of trouble uh gets out of control investors going to demand more\nAnd if that even if that never happens look at look at the binary in right now where we love to spend more on good projects that have a societal benefit right we infrastructure it's being crowded out by the debt\nLook at the drive on yeah absolutely you\nHey let's talk about Hoover Hoover ah suggesting that they're going to hire either Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs maybe both bringing up a ... in fact I'll bet you they end up having a whole bunch of uh underwriters yeah half a dozen yeah and\nSuggesting though that the company had miraculously is worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars I I I don't know where\nThey're getting that from now I Know I understand folks when Goldman Sachs goes to ... and says hey we want to be your investors they they have to pitch them high price right it's like oh and you're listening you're home for say right to ... all worth a fortune John I can get a million for this place I've never seen a play so no doubt [laughter]\nYeah so yeah they're the plan is here for a loop or to go public in the next year\nIf I were an order next year yeah if I was that might be hurrying up because the the ideal market is very strong I speak on\nFirst hand experience here that they're hard to get there being priced aggressively and they're doing very well and the after market or so after a big drop a couple of years ago and valuation\nWhoever has in their defense really right right of the ship good CEO but why should I buy them\nWhen I'm looking at General Motors and I'm looking at ... and I'm saying these are two companies that are on the cusp of self driving technology way mo rolling out self driving taxis ... in cue for\nThis year I'll take I'll take the other side and I I I don't necessarily disagree with you but the argument would be there\nOther people doing that and it's ... it's it's important but Wilbur has a very fantastic advantage in terms of what they do as far as\nScale being in a lot of places\nHaving a model that now works quite well people like it people like it you know if you gave me a hundred billion dollars instead build a new Hoover\nI think I'd say Barry I'd better things you do with your money I think it will be very hard to beat them and General Motors is great Ford is great but there's a lot of people that make really nice cars but doesn't have to come out and say yeah we're going public but we also have this joint venture we're we're doing it with Wayne all because they got to get rid of the drivers\nThe drivers are killing them yet and I think what's going to happen is the drivers gonna get slowly phased out I think ... ... uh ten years five years and years Fifteen Years up and right above the questions right away what what kind of threat is this next couple of years bottom line is though remember what we're going to use that technology to its advantage\nWe can argue about who's going to win the battle for technology whether it's gonna be wing or whether it's going to be you know GM's project which is which is doing really well\nBut I Am a funny feeling was ... maybe the customer that and that the argument over is going to make is\nWe are the leader in this and it's a very hard not to crap if you've ever tried to compete with us what about list they have done well maybe\nI lose list that you you what do you use talk I switched over to lift really cheaper\nLightly slightly cheaper and cheaper is this a dual ... is this little guys that are driving by the way are driving both yeah you're right is this coke and Pepsi I mean this may not be an either or this may be a a venue where Wilbur and lift have essentially a ... you know they try to be the number three guy\nIt it it would be very well the the thing that the reason I'd be hesitant\nTo buy Hoover on the appeal is way more ... I I'm scared to death of Google\nBut they're not going directly in competition sure they are they're going rolling out self ... they just ordered sixty thousand taxis so they've got the technology to do it and they've got that and they ordered the cars but can they execute a ... that's a great point that's not a national international Rosen Paris\nEverybody used over right it tax isn't it the the value of a taxi medallions in\nParis has diminished the same degree as it has in New York City while the people love over I'll tell you though I I think there is a good use [laughter]\nMy son is taking up a business course an MBA at Boston University and he turned me onto this concept in business which really is I think an overriding concept the value of companies today is largely based on their platforms and the platform that ... has\nI think has an immense amount of value and they can use that platform to expand their business and they can use this in by this technology if they need to\nBut would you rather have the platform or the technology good question I'd like that but I'd like to go off and yeah and and I the the question is can ... developed the platform faster than Hoover can develop the technology\nWill and we'll go we'll do a mole license their technology see way more numerous way mo was a huge investor in ...\nRight and then Kalanick screwed them and and now they're they're I now I don't know ... are they back in bed together\nWere at least something great question or because they can both be successful in their own way but they might not be successful at what the other guy does way back to what you could say hey we're going to license this technology to list we're going to visit taxi dot com you'll get a license at\nThat too over rental license everybody can add some stupid your way mo is Google crooked wholly owned a shop that they they are\n... you know if if if you talk to people in the transportation business they will tell you that way more is light years ahead of everybody\nElse although General Motors reportedly is is right up there I Hope so but yeah I mean General Motors may in fact General Motors may rollout a separate IP oh\nOf the driverless division and by the way it's got to be pretty good because Honda signed up as the ... in that project ... and I I've heard some people say General Motors is actually a head of ... in\nThe technology I had not heard that there are some people believe that when we come back we'll be talking about the job market if you're looking for work there is no excuses lots of jobs out there that's

what is it exactly they do\nUm they invest in um what they hope program addict assets that have ... positive greenhouse gas profile meaning clinic cleaner energy infrastructure as well as um like water conservation infrastructure can also be energy efficiency\nProjects um renewables like solar and wind um so it's a it's a large variety of asset assets related to clean energy and better use of resources\nAs it relates to climate change and sustainability\nCan we think of handling as almost an energy investment fund the Sikhs outsmart energy investments\nThey they do they write the checks for these investments that they are the\nIn that store and and\nAlso offer services to the top engineering companies in the world so they have deep and long relationships with these various engineering firms\nAnd that is kind of like like a cornerstone of their business so it's a reliable pipeline of projects that are high quality um\nBut yet the the the stock itself as a huge dividend yield more than double the market to me that's oftentimes a red flag what is the risk that the markets cease in this investment that are maybe others might not see\n'em you know I think the stock went down like a year ago and in the last year and a half because of the changing interest rate environment\nAnd I think I'm the market has had a hard time classifying exactly what had an Armstrong does some um put it in the commercial mortgage rate bucket other an infrastructure rate back at 'em it's classified as a rate but\nI just consider it an infrastructure play clean and cleaner infrastructure and I think the market opportunity\nIs large going forward and um the risks are you know the risk to any stock in general is that you know if we had a recession you know maybe maybe there's not as many projects an infrastructure that would be a downside\nUm however because they're in a space where they invested in smaller size projects\nI think that's actually a competitive advantage for them relative to um maybe other types of infrastructure investors or or engineering and ...\nSays this is to be more of like being under a rock and under a cloud which is a good thing a lot of times that's undetected ... yes let's turn over to Oxley Pete occidental petroleum much better known obviously tell us why you like the traditional oil play\nI like them first because I mean they've done quite well\nEven with the downturn we had an oil prices they\nAsked directly it had a load a they've always they've paid a very good to have it in like the last two years they've had a twelve percent continues annual growth and there does it end it's north of four percent\nUm they're conservative um even when they have a considerable amount of Permian Basin acreage which is yeah the hot kind of you know al producing area\nAnd even then they approached um fracking conservatively but now they're now one of the you know they had some of the best wells that what I also like about them is they're diversified\nUm they have ... cents a can a chemical business and export capabilities\nThe price of oil do they need to make to make solid profits\nUm they they\nIn a fifty dollar re loan um that's that's where they they they do find that kind of their break even threshold for us but um\nYeah and so in oil prices are in a decent rain yeah and and that's really not expect it to change you know considerably I think even let's just say hypothetically we had a recession and a year or two I just don't see oil prices I'm going\nDown to the level that they did during the sort\nOf not not nearly
