P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nUm the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the San says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight\nBut she doesn't have anything to do you know and\nSo all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirit anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know and years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide in Fort at the end of that successful session can you share those words

they think that All right I'm I'm putting these assets in a vault they're no longer mine I've got no control I've got no power\nIs there anything about these eerie vocal trust that can actually be changed once you've created them\nSo you just sparked two questions in my head when you said that one and and I don't remember if I share the story with you if I did apologize I'm doing it again I have clients that come in with that exact mentality that you just described shared about\nThe irrevocably trust right and this particular person had worked at Polaroid and retired and came in with that attitude I Can't I Want to do it but I Know we were vocal trust just like you described Susan mhm and I said to him\nYou worked at polarized right said yeah I said did they make a camera\nHe said yeah I go to make one camera or did they make\nLots of cameras he said oh we made all kinds of cameras and I said there's all kinds of irrevocably trusts out there and we can't come into these meetings with that preconceived idea about one kind of your vocal trust and that really helped him understand\nBecause a lot of people they hear little sound bites if you will about different types of very vocal about trust and it's not necessarily ... only correct\nAnd so now to answer your question one that sparked in my head enough to answer your question yes there are things that can be changed and the trust and again I think the flexibility is really similar to the flexibility of revoke about trust I mean let's face it\nWhen you want to change or revoke about trust and I have lots of clients with revoke will trust\nThey come in and what do they want to change not paragraph thirty five right of the trust they although they could\nThey come in and say you know what I Want to leave a

can I leave a little more than one child than another\nWell yeah in the revolt will trust world we make that change for them and that's really all they ever want to change right or maybe the

envious blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nTaught him if you questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Brenda in Hampton New Hampshire and Brenda writes I Am Seventy nine years old single and I own my own home and a rental property my total net worth is around eight hundred and fifty thousand\nI Do not have any children although I Do have a few nieces that I'm close to and will likely leave my state to them when I pass would it make sense for me to create a trust at this point I Do have a five year long term care policy that has increased to about three hundred and Seventy five dollars per day\nSo I'm not concerned with nursing home costs would that be the only reason for me to create a trust\nWell let's just isn't just as great because this is the kind of question almost like when we've talked to people and done shows on how to get started what to look for what kind of plan is right for me and I think that's really what brand is asking right here\nUm and so everybody listen to this fact pattern in and and put yourself in it and see if this applies to you\nFirst of all I I see you're under a million\nDoesn't really matter because you're in New Hampshire resident so there's no federal there is no state to state tax you don't need our help for that\nTrust will at least help you avoid probate I see the rental property the home there's really no way to avoid probate what those items or a short of putting another person's name on and which I don't want you to do other than a trust so again revoked ... or your vocal will\nGet you there okay in terms of avoiding probate and and then the rest of your bank accounts or investment accounts I Would also put in the trust that we create\nAnd just back up for one second time because the the point you made about avoiding\nProbate if she didn't create created trust now her executive her niece who never would have to go through probate and I would venture to guess that for an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar estate it would cost them more to go through probate than to set up a trust to begin with\nI Would think that's the cash shore and it's not just the cost which is certainly there and and the evident\nAh but the headache yeah at the time can consumption the you know why bother with that if I don't have to yeah when you could go just sit in the lawyers conference room and pull out the estate planning and let him or her explain you know what the next steps are and how the asset\nYou know and it's all private ... I I think that in of itself enough\nReason why people would want to write not do that so All right so now I've I've got to the point where if avoiding probate is one of your concerns then and that's your only concern that a revolt couple trust will get you there you don't need the irrevocably trust\n'em now also the revolt will trust\nWill allow you to direct how when when your nieces and nephews get the assets rang and\nAnd and that's important because you know maybe you want a divorce proof for them maybe one creditor protected for them maybe there's things you want to do with these assets to protect them or to control them from the grave and the revoke about trust in this example will do that now when you were a vocal trust would do that as well\nBut I'm Still kind of focused on the revolt couple so those would be too important reasons probate and how to get it to them maybe help excluded from their state for a state tax purposes as well as skip a generation maybe control it for the uh great nieces and nephews as well\nAnd if she doesn't have any plan in place right now including a well\nThose assets those wouldn't land with her niece's they will go to a different succession plan right well\nI'm not really sure if you don't have a well you're you're you're correct you'd have to look to the interstate succession statute in it might be they would go to the next closest next of kin which\nYou know probably not parents if she's Seventy nine but that would be next right then it would be siblings so the fact that she's got nieces and nephews were telling me that she does have siblings and unless they pray to sister\nUm than\nThose assets we'll go to siblings first right and you're never really want to leave it across the generation you always want to leave it down a generation to save taxes\nAnd not to mention her siblings are probably the same age that she is in maybe have is yeah nursing homes\nAnd it could be a nursing home issue and and the last comment would be why not do that your vocal trust well she does have a decent amount of long term care insurance coverage which I think is helpful number one not enough to cover the full boat\nBut again having no immediate children her immediate need might not be all yeah it's very important that I save assets from the nursing home for my nieces and nephews more you know whatever's left they can have\nWell if that's the case then you don't coupled with the long term care insurance I'd probably be leaning towards the revolt couple of trust plan for her hands are based on this this fact\nSome type of trust playing Brenda because you want to avoid probing you want to make sure those assets go where you want them to folks if you are considering creates\nAnd you're ... you're not sure really what you should be looking for when you sit down with the attorney that's going to draft your documents\nTodd has created a guide for the month of October it's titled designing and income only irrevocably

want to run into any issues down the road as she is in failing health\nOh dawn I'm going to start off by saying I'm not loving the idea of you buying a home right I mean can you buy the home and in fact I I had a student in my class asked a similar question\nWhat is fair market value and you know what if you sell the home right before you go to the nursing home is that going to be a

[noise] scoring gluten for for the ... so it ... comes\nFrom the corn intimidating to grow around there so so ... that's basically what it is it to get the gluten from the corn product [laughter] and ... what do they call it\n... they have a great corn gluten product and then they have a they have it in their past spring fertilizer okay\nSo they put it that way and that is the way it is a powder it's a it's like a liquid\n... than powder and it's a little bit smaller than like a heavy grand you'll\nKnow but it's not a liquid no great but they make a liquid sacred deal to remove um crab rationale\nOr I had it or I haven't seen a liquid from Yemen organic one\nI was just listening to that so I wasn't certain hours that's one of their little quickie question associate Cox comb shaped one you know what I'm Talking about it and why the seat boy they are tiny they're about the size if not I don't even think the size of a normal\nPin head if you say your song and head well how do you plant those in the spring time do you do it or put them out and you know seating boxes or whatever\nSo you could do those in the spring uh starting them inside the way to do it is that puts them in water for a few days okay a lot of outdoor by the water is soften the shell that type of thing and then plant them into you know either Pete pots or like the six pack\nOr something along those lines are going to get them started you can start um inside with like a roll light\nAnd I wanted to get them started and then once the grounds um ... yeah you're not getting enough frost you can put them outside or you could just wait until the springs yeah one of the if you're trying to prolong um when you start them\nYou could take the seeds put them in between damp paper towels not like heavy wet but damn do not know I understood them and put them into like a plastic bag\nAnd put them into the refrigerator for a couple of months\nReally let them have like a dorm and see period usually it's about six to eight weeks\nChecking on that that paper towel that you put them in between and make sure there's no mold or anything along those lines maybe changing out the the paper towel a couple of times ... could help you [noise] um but that might be the best way to do it\nReally I mean I could even just plant um what what would be the time of normal a seat growth it's not a native to this area is that you know saying\nThat really has an annual so putting it in the ground I'd say the earliest would be around may twentieth got your you know when the last frost usually happens\nI understand that yeah so in any case um\n... it's a you're only going to get so much growth time and then there's going to freeze out is that it when it comes to okay and kill OK buddy you don't put it into anything they're so tiny the seats they make like a powdery type of a material to planted in\n... most I'm ... I'm soils like a a seat starting is like that it's basically a soil is mix it has yeah if you're ... your ... your lights per lights that type of thing mixed into it that some ... ... that type of thing\nSo that it's a lighter mix it's not that heavy mix that um you would just outside for a party and soil\nNo that's what I'm saying I can get lost the he took it lost all of these very and a half of them you know what I'm saying yeah we got just as glad\nWhen you plant or make sure when you do put them in the ... ... ads some water to the soil first yes is putting them in and then putting the seat in your kitchen stabbing yeah keeps them in the same area that's what I\nOr do we have you with Chicago did you guys hear me I can hear you excellent excellent that we were just talking or if you could hear us last segment but about uh the latest that Rob Gronkowski\nWho will not play today he's been downgraded out for the patriots there is some good news on the injury front though\nI Adam ... after I had this just minutes ago on Twitter patriots running backs Sony Michel with his knee injury and wide receiver Julian Edelman with his he'll both listed as questionable for today are both expected to play against the bears that for a source so that's from Chester\nBut there will be a there'll be no Bronx today grants thinking it backs the patriots\nObviously makes it easier for Dick van geo and and the bears to sort of decide what they're gonna do defensively I mean now you don't have to worry about ground gash in you in the same you also was a an excellent blocker I thought he did a really good job last week against Kansas City the times they asked him to pass\nProtector chip on D Ford so you don't have to worry about ground doing that either you know Dwayne Allen is a very good blocker but any limits a lot of the weapons or the patriots and really makes it a little bit more of a perimeter game I mean obviously joined Edelman being a slot receiver that he is will will move the chains and go over the middle but when you've got ... you can just gas you've done\nAnd it seems there that's a real concern for defense so when you take away you know one of the top weapons that that obviously makes it easier for the bears to decide how they're going to defend the patriots you know a big\nPart of today was also what was going to be the status of Julian Edelman and now we hear from from chapter that is a go I didn't think that he was not going to play but uh is he a full health and if he is it for health shouldn't that make us feel better about the situation I Know that I Do\nYeah I mean absolutely I mean you see what the ... has been like\nYou know since he was able to sort of get back in the flow here and how that has opened things up or you know there's no question about that that he is Tom Brady security blanket he's somebody who can move the chains for them\nWho if they get into a situation where it's a third and long they can go to Adam in and he can get that you know and you also sort of helps keep them out of some of those third amongst too with with those little four or five six yard completion over the middle on first and second down so you know the beginning of the season so much of the talking so much of what we talked about was\nTom Brady report with his wide receivers and did he trust these wide receivers what we know that he trusts join Edelman implicitly and and I don't mean is a big part of the engine of this off fence those little ... that just keep you out of\nBad situation you know keep you out of thirty eight thirty nine thirty eleven because he picks up six or seven yards earlier in the possession\nSix one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five the telephone number here on Patriot's preview Chris Gaspar is in Chicago on back here in Fox borough patriots are taking on the bears today what do you think about the spot of his game Chris just in terms of where the patriots are at their coming off a big win last Sunday uh they've got some other big games that are coming up on their schedule\nIs this is this one of those games where it's not to be overlooked because the bears have certainly improve this year and made a major edition defensively ... his availability today how much he plays is a question but just a spot for the patriots plane fares team where do you think the bears around and sort of their their growth\nWell you know the bears obviously coming off a disappointing loss to Miami with brought us while they're in there and an uncharacteristically they're run defense led down there but they've been they've been a really good defense\nThis year and I think this is sort of approval game and a lot of ways for the Chicago team was matinee again you know people want to see are they for real is Michel ... offensive side for real is this defense for real they've done a great job forcing turnovers this year fourteen turnovers\nThat they force and we all know that they can get after the passer so I I think this is one of those games where the bears are looking at it and saying well if we go out and beat the patriots here you know that sort of establish as us as legitimate\nAs one of the legitimate surprise teams in the NFL you know from from the patriots standpoint you want to keep the momentum rolling but also the last two times you've gone on the road you're going to hand it to you\nOr so it was you know so we know that this group of patriots can play well at home but I think they have something to prove\nIn coming on the road playing a team that's in first place in the NFC North that has a very good defense which would be a hostile environment I think it's an important game for the patriots in terms of the growth of the team you know it's not a great spot I think for really for either team health wise right I mean no ... Mac\nRise banged up so I think you can look at that and and neither team really has that excuse but both teams have something to prove but I think it's more about the bears the bears can make a big statement today if they go out and play a very competitive game against the patriots or beat the Patriot\nYeah I totally agree with that and that's why I sort of ask you that question because it seems to me like the patriots are again a team after winning\nAll these games at home they're sort of okay established as another team in the league that will continue to have a target on their back right because when it gets the patriots is always going to be considered a good big win for whoever it is they're playing it for a team like the bears their young they've got a young quarterback they've got a young head coach sort of working to establish\nThemselves in their program\nThis feels like one of those spots where the patriots are getting it all they can handle from a team like Chicago today and without Rob Gronkowski I think that makes it more difficult for the patriots\nIs it a question here here's a question I Do have yeah and and I have thoughts on it and that is who's escape bigger for for the patriots is a bigger further off ants because of the bears defense or is it bigger for their defense given that they gave up forty points a week ago at home\nI think it's bigger for the defense you're you're facing matinee ... who is in Andy Reid disciple\nAnd and we've talked about as you look at what happened last week against Kansas City you give up to forty points you gave a forty one and the super bowl to Doug Peterson Andy Reid disciple last year in the season opener agile that he gave a forty two so it would seem that there are elements of that scheme that give you some issues there are elements of offenses that have\nPaid speeds base and that's something that has meant this bears team are going to see you know to recall when and Taylor Gabriel those guys can really run so I think if you're the patriots you sort of have to prove that this is a scheme and this is a a plan of attack that you can do a better job defending against than allowing forty points Everytime you face it\nRight which has been their problem as you mentioned the super bowl as you mentioned last week but\nI have to be honest with you I don't think much differently about the patriots events after watching last week's game\nWell we're like yeah I don't I don't feel that I expected them to be better my expectations for this defense were were were higher than they work for the last years okay I Would agree with that it might work too but I've sort of adjusted and as we've moved along my expectations for the defense in the pre season has sort of been adjusted because\nI think linebacker at times is still very much an issue for them at times it's not a at times they're they look okay uh but I I feel like my expectations from two months ago or a little different now and I think\nYou know what I think Chris I think that this team and this doesn't just apply to the defense this team is a lot like last year's team they're very similar they're not all that different and so I look at the defense so yeah you know the defenses do worse than it was a year ago right you would agree with that\nYeah I Would agree with that deal worse as well but but but\nThat's pretty to me it shouldn't should automatically be better I mean I thought it would be a better defense\nI did too we seen so I Do too and it's not and I admit that and I agree with you on that but I feel that this team is remarkably similar to what last year's team was and I would say what you believe they can achieve should that be similar to what you thought of last year's team\nAnd the fact is and I think you've written a call about this [laughter] you get to the Superbowl celebrating throws were five hundred yards and you lose the game and if your defenses better you win the game yeah I think if you play that game now if you play that game ten times\nThe patriots all when some of those games so the expectations of the team overall for me or hey getting to the super bowl and and see what happens that's how I sort of feel about it so I guess the biggest rate on all this to me is the Kansas City chiefs the team that was there a week ago\nAnd they won this time you know the patriots won granted the games at home that's a big factor but I don't feel any different than I did a year ago and I don't feel different about the events that I did two weeks ago so\nHere's what I Would say I understand what you're saying in terms of not feeling different about a year ago but a year ago you had\nGuys like markets flowers and Johnson data most e and Jordan Richard trying to play line backer running around\nYou don't have that now so you should be better I mean high towers back in their right or you you you added a guy like a drink labor not that he's going to be defending people in space all the time but it's you don't have cash is marsh we're running around out there you you should be better because you were putting guys out there\nWho really were below replacement level players and eventually they got exposed which is what ... what happens you know ... does a great job of masking the deficiencies of players like that\nAnd maximizing their strengths but at a certain point you know it's not about access knows it's about Jimmy's in Joe's and if a guy's just not good enough he's not good enough it's a little different when you look out there and say wait a second why it's ... or ... not good enough to make that tackle that guy should be good enough to get that guy on the ground that's the difference for me from last year\nTo to this year you have guys that should be talented enough that zone China yeah\nI I don't know if they had the smoothest ride soldier field or\nYou have guys that should be on paper talented enough to make these plate and they're not making them\nRight which [laughter] which which means you can't just look at the names and count on the talent that's been there over the years right so OK Deb ... Cody maybe as last this that dot the I's tower I think at times it looks like he's lost more than what staff and other times you looked just fine he's looked like\nSame player so yeah I guess you're right they have high tower back and you look at guys like him accordion say why can't they make that plate\nWhile they're eight I with an eleven million dollar cap even getting older spot you know they've invested in that spot where it should be strengthened again going back to the super bowl it wasn't those safety did not player tackle well and the super bowl and I didn't think that they played well last week\nNo they didn't they didn't play last week in fact a Nobel check for Twenty one points a devil accordion\nEric ... patients have reason to cheer\nHi I'm David I was a resident in the highlands because of stream we person my legs I was unable to stand and the protein the physical occupational therapists help a lot of the lead defendants now I'm back home with the CIA program\nI this is a violence once a month and try to return the favor by playing the piano singing for the people and the residents thanks to life around now back on the day\nCare centers of America helping you get back in the game [noise]\nA judge shouldn't do trading stores visitors blues ... there's a joy to angry beaver loose in the store\nTo rubber ... cigar bar owes word vegetable cart but be immediately [noise]\nWay above what George W inconvenient\nAnd so you were show up and go do [noise]\n... double dilute ... both student ...\n...\nHalf way down the line they had high up against a free man why\nHe lost\nA lot of games together so when I say it's necessarily a hundred percent that but we were able to play some ... some things up like always that you always want to work on and with repetition that that comes so we're\nAlways on the improved programs and constantly trying to do that in practice and each week practice was going to make you probably a little better so that's what he looks horses [noise]\nThat is Patriot's receiver Julian Edelman time now for fantasy update broad you buy a Nissan Leaf sons it easier choice than ever would they're exciting and fuel efficient line up now get great offers across their full line shop at your local Nissan story and Jews Nissan dot\nCom I think if you're looking for a player to plug into your line up today Julian Edelman might be a good choice considering Rob Gronkowski is injured Edelman will probably be the safety like at the security blanket for Tom Brady and grits he sort of fits the game plan probably today at wanting to get rid of the ball quickly for\nTom Brady and element is obviously the best guy for that\nYeah and you know the ... year we'll play you know sort of a lot of zone or like zone type concepts there so\nI don't mean it's really good at finding the sauce spots in there and and as we said many times in the past a lot of times\nTom Brady is his own best to pass protection just his ability to diagnose a defense quickly and get rid of the ball and you know when you look at his patriots fans obviously you know it's really rocking and rolling you know Hussein's week for I mean averaging thirty nine point six points per game and\nFour hundred and sixty two point three yards of total often so before we were so concerned about this off ... and now it's it's definitely founded\nScrew six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five or do you want to get to a little news item on the patriots salary capital hang on a ... couple of minutes we're going to fill in the winter I feel\nHey what's going on a bill okay so it seems to go for the office of each other yeah absolutely that the science and we should not have to report about forty five ...\nI'm ... and the\nBoy did they what are they prepared to do to help the secondary help help with the secondary yeah look what he's got old absolutely like Kyrie ...\nWatched us last week course stuff last week I all the older you got to do is run splits over the middle of the past will get past the land back as ... and ... and the whole free nobody's given the corners any help ... what are they going to do you know\nSo why would you say the recording is the least of their worries sounds like\nYou know I I mean ...\nI I mean I wouldn't say she's the beliefs that no that's not what I'm saying that all I'm saying it effects or is it is a big worry I'm just say ...\n... ... what are they going to do I mean it it ... I mean it looks that that they're not getting any any any uh they're not getting any pushups fraud I mean yeah you said Hi towel he looks you know he looks like is all self sometimes\nWell bill you know I Believe it or not your calls going to be the perfect transition into the next part of this pre game show and that is this step on Gilmore has restructured his contract to create cap space for the patriots his cap it\nHas moved out from twelve point five million to eight point eight million the patriots currently have\nFive point a little more than five point three million Chris in cap space that was created by this restructure\nBy step on Gilmore which means they've got the availability and the ability I should say to go out and make a deal before the trade deadline which comes up nine days from now do you think that's what that move was about I think that's\nPart of it I mean you always want to have the flexibility to make a move you know there are a lot of people who have a reporter do you know on Twitter um that you know part of this is they have these not\nLikely to be earned incentives that are now you know likely to be earned that they have to have the cap space to be able to pay out bans in um you know Boston sports journalist who's all over that stuff\nTweeted that out so I think that's part of it you want to have some space in case somebody shakes free where you can make a move there but I don't think it was just\nJust about going and getting somebody had said that I I think it's the patriots being the patriots want to be in a position where if something happened they compounds and they also want to be in a better position to be able to pay out these incentives and not be completely hamstrung against the cap\nSo cool it could mean it could be multiple things is what it could mean is that it could yeah I mean and what I'm saying is I'm not sure they did this to targeting one base if a player oh sorry Chris again\nYeah I'm saying I I don't think they did this and said okay we're targeting this specific guy we need this amount of cats base for this guy I think it's generally speaking more okay if we have an opportunity here to to improve our team and make a move we want to make sure we're in position to do it\nStay connected during the biggest moments of every game with expanding the Internet delivering reliably fast speeds even during peak

Bigelow steam grab a mug and tea proudly mark Bertrand at splits ville patriot place Fox borrow Chris gasp or is that soldier field in Chicago as we get ready for patriots bears Chris and I just pulled up to play\nAnd I'm not saying the coaches but I think he thinks he's like he's like we went from one Bozo and Ben ... due\nTo another and ... and I think he feels like the quarterback has done this team is going nowhere so\nYou know that's it I I just feel like he is disconnected from this team and I think the giants made a miscalculation\nI think the date that will give him his contract and he'll be happy and he will feel a in a way that he owes us and and and that will be the situation that he's kind of like well I got my contract I'm good I can speak freely I can act really and it's gone the other way\nWhat a bunch of holes in New York I'm enjoying this I'm enjoying everything that it's going on with the New York giants so all your giants fans listen up your team's screwed up they drafted a running back they didn't draft a quarterback now their guy can't play anymore and you spend Ninety five million bucks on a guy who doesn't really care to be involved in the team\nGo go into work they're nice franchise you have there I oh I hear that people in New York pitching about the front office there right fishing about all the GM\nWhy do they not go after the owner in New York what do they ever go after ownership there\nI feel like there has to do that in New York ... at some point you gotta look at your own her and say have you put the right people in charge to run the football team have you have you done the right things because your team is terrible and has been for a while I mean they had the uh the Lebanon five record two seasons ago\nBut other than that you know their regular seasons in the last five six years have been downright\nAwful absolutely terrible and I'll tell you what are some enjoying every moment of it I Love it I Love seeing the giants fail and be as bad as they are right now I Love it I Love that they drafted cycle I'm Barkley I'm enjoying the hell out of it so there's bad that's what I wanted to say about the New York giants today\nLet's go to your phone six or seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by Dardanelles in Queens he died out\nHey guys how's it going what's up oh no I just\nWanted to call and get your thoughts on a three colon because ah he's not sorry killed don't get me wrong is not as fast as not a skilled and stuff but he's a similar type player ... allowed to see what the chief did with diary kill and maybe do a little bit of that with the recall and look it up on the\nI think that he's a he's a dangerous threat Chris do you think tire recalling could have the type of night that you saw a diary kill out of a week ago [noise] I\nI you know I don't think you're going to see it as much down the field like that but I think it could be more like the night that cream hunt had\nYou know Ninety eight receiving yard sort of out of the backfield so\nHe's definitely a weapon to recall a definitely a weapon for the bears and that sort of would fit into the theme of when you're going against the patriots that if you have a running back or third down back someone that you can put out in space or that you can foresee linebacker safety to cover down the field\nOr that you can take advantage of that and you can take advantage of the patriots there so I Would think he would be a big part of his game plan\nFor the bears also you know the other thing is he he's run the ball really well this year for the bears as a runner a five point three yards per rush he actually has been more effective running the football than Jordan Howard\nSo you know Jim Murray and I had a bill ... bears blogger on\nYesterday and he was talking about the fact that there's a lot of talk here in Chicago you know sort of what's up with Jordan Howard and is he a fit for this system with Matt navy whereas to Rico and you know is it fit for this system so it's not just in passing game you have to worry about going into running the football too and he and he's a big play guy in a home run threat\nLast two games receiving wise or seven catches for a hundred and Twenty one yards at seven catches for Ninety yards victory going so in the receiving game he's been a big factor yeah or the or for the Chicago Bears but as you mentioned ah he has run the ball well\nSo far this season he's average over five yards the Kerry although he hasn't really had that many carries\nHe's had nearly as many catches disease that carries Twenty one cat just at this point thirty two carries so definitely the ... guy who could do it both out of the backfield but he's got some he's got some speeding catch the ball and he's already out over a hundred yard one one hundred and Twenty one yard game to this point\nA full strength for Josh Gordon today and the patriots as they go into Chicago without Rob Gronkowski one

identification on the future it's Ninety eight five sports patriots radio network\nDon't give a big place at least not for touchdowns stop team on the red area and generate turnovers and and that's fine if you can play that type of defense I mean again no one's expecting the patriots defense to be the eighty five bears but I think if you go into these games\nParticularly against this scheme with Matt ... and you you your expectation is Tom Brady if you're going to win this game you have to put up forty plus points\nI I don't think that that's really the formula to end up winning a six Super Bowl I think you're asking a lot there and you go back to the super bowl last year and what won the game a great defensive player from Brandon Graham so defense doesn't matter as much but you have to be able to make the huge stops\nAt the right time and I still have hope that eventually this defense can get to the point where they can do that by the end of the year I'm gonna I'm gonna subscribe to the whole you know there'll be better in December than in September and October thing with this deep and it's I think they can be better than this and they should be better than this\nI if they can get to the point where they're forcing the key turnovers I think you're right that's all you need then you can ride with Tom Brady a long ways and now last week I Would question whether you take the ball away\nOr did the often sort of give it to you\nBecause it's they don't have an ... that was a great but yeah I just it was a stray just straight up take away that was a straight up mistake by quarterback who's ... them into the throw you can't do that it's like when you look in the rearview mirror on the highway and you think you know or a car is and then you switch lanes you run right into that car that's on you\nYour insurance is going up baby your points are going up because you can't assume where cars you got to look a second time and I think you saw a young quarterback who assumes after a first step he knew where that line backer was going and that's literally in my opinion a rookie starter mistake but sort of make plays like that\nYou can make plays like that over the long haul whatever way it is stripped sex sports mumbles interceptions baiting quarterbacks that's enough in this league yards be damned I Know they still say number one defense based and yards allowed ... it's all about takeaways\nNow I'm just going to say quickly I disagree on the gift thing you know what a gift turnover as a gift turnovers when Ryan ... snapped to him and can't catch it

Davis or you're an actor is for the patriots or Rob Gronkowski being downgraded to out he's dealing with a back injury and mark is canon Bob are not able to recover from the concussion that he suffered last week was training is way at the end of the week you didn't practice he was listed as doubtful\nWhat's your level of faith in later in model to do the job in the absence of Ghana today\nYeah but I think you know you go back to ... game and the patriots did a very good job of containing ... Mac with mark is Ken and our rights the ethical remembered all Adrian ... had to take over for Canada for much of the year and it was\nA water rather than a cat and flag against Mac against the Oakland Raiders in that game in Mexico city but the thing about today's game is without clock and of course you have no other ... and Alan you expect principally not to stay in\nAnd block but it's not just ... gets what he does in concert with the ... and eddy Goldman and the other guys in that front seven for Chicago\nAnd makes it difficult a lot of teams slide protection toward Mac and as good as he's bad\nOr the feeling around here even as expressed by defensive coordinator of the banjo is that\nHe's created opportunities for a game of Hicks and that's why they play next to one another on the line almost exclusively on the left side of the Chicago defensive lots of the pets you got to the past contain Mac pretty well even last year with lotto rather than can and but I think the group as a whole is a lot different than what they saw one Mac was a member of the writers\n... I see when I look at the bears side of things with these inactive looks like there are guys they really needed to go are going to be able to go here Bryce Callahan is a go for them Allen Robin synagogue for them and you obviously mentioned we'll Mac\nWhat does that do for the patriotism of the bears people are bears reporters I've spoken to have said Bryce Callahan arguably been their best corner this years this last guy\nYeah Chris I think this team for Chicago last week not withstanding has been very impressive and a lot of different ways and the development of ... the last couple of weeks now granted the quality of the competition that he's ... and uh his lackluster when you consider Arizona and Tampa Bay but this is a team that is only a handful of points away from being on ... and at this point\nAnd you look at the ... player the secondary they've got ten interceptions a lot of it's created\nA because they don't have to send extra pass Russia's they've gotten to the quarterbacks Eighteen times this year thirty three quarterback hits but they're not sending typically five six guys so they've been able to match up so well and again that a lot of that goes back to the fact that you have a guy like Mac\nWho so good from the edge in someone like Hicks who's done such a great job for them more than a loving sex the last two years combine are getting pressure on the quarterback and they've covered with more than they've been able to take the ball away a lot\nWe're talking with Bob socio ... broadcast booth in Chicago up Bob\nWhen you look at this game and and you look at the game the patriots played a week ago against a I'm an anti Reid disciple excuse me this week against an anti Reid disciple last week against any read and what do you think we see from the patriots the parents today\nBecause I have a market how we see a lot more of what we witness last week in the first half against Kansas City because I thought the defense all things considered\nA especially based on the expectations going into that game and the production of Kansas city's office and the defense did exactly what it had to do the first thirty minutes of that game they got a couple of turnovers they got stopped and the red zone and they gave their often an opportunity to have to score late but obviously there was a let down\nIn the second half and that's been the case the last couple of weeks have a lot fifty two points in the second half more than five hundred yards against the Colts\nAs well as the Kansas City chiefs so it's not just the second half of Kansas City but I think even the previous week despite a big lead that was disappointing uh in their performance and the thing about Chicago Tuesday may not have a ... hill but\nThey do the same type of things that anti Reid does with Matt negra remember he took over for Reid late last season as the caller\nFor the cheese they have a lot of different types of skilled players who really forces you to defend just about everything and they have a lot of formations maybe not a lot of complex place per se but how they get to them can be very confusing for defenses and we know the patrons of health problems whether it was Andy Reid Doug Peterson\nOr ... or as a a head coach raw sense of coordinator going up against that type of office the last few years\nBob Baer's run defense for the most part has been very good this year fourth in the league you know eighty three yards per game but Miami was really able to run the football against them\nFrank or went over a hundred yards won a Kenyan drag added fifty seven at a hundred and sixty one yards rushing I bring that up because we seem to each week that Sony Michel has gotten better and better and better and more decisive with the decision\nAnd his cuts for the patriots is this the Sony Michel game or do you think the patriots just try and throw it all around the yard\nYeah 'cause I think it's a good point about Chicago's rushing defense because they have in a lot of rushing touched down this year they've allowed only a handful of\nRushing first downs and you go back to the absence of Gronkowski as good as James Devlin has spent as a full back to lead the way and a lot of those inside runs for Sony Michel o'clock with a wound block and now not having a combination of the two titans therefore him how does that affect the way they use doubling today\nOr do they have to offset him and he was more as an H back then they they might otherwise uh you know those some of the things that I'm Wondering about going into this game I think it's going to be tough to run on Chicago or the way they've been able to run almost will the last couple of weeks they I think having a good all sense of line and I think Sony has really progress\nBut Chicago has been solid today and I always take into account the conditions in Miami [noise]\nWe've seen patriot teams go down there and not play well in a very hot day last week game time type of eighty nine and heat index much higher than that in the bears out of Twenty one to Thirteen lead\nEarly in the fourth quarter and they turn the ball over it was a really careless play the gave Miami the chance to come back and eventually get even before the bears regained lead all via briefly I so they weren't control that game despite the statistics early in the fourth quarter and then let it get away from them [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "21"}
