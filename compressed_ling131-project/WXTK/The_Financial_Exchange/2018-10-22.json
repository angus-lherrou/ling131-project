before that another man was mall luckily not killed by great white shark why would you almost be\nGlorifying a great white shark why would you do that\n[noise]\nAh so I keep reading the story and why did they do this according to the principal Robin Millan or of the elementary school in Chatham\nA giant\nGreat white shark more than a hundred and Seventy feet long almost spanning the entire outfield was created last Wednesday in Chatham\nCheck this out everybody as recognition of Chatham elementary school students positive behavior\nFor\nOh I Know I don't have children I don't want to pick on a wall um entry school down in Chatham I'm sure it's a nice elementary school I'm sure all your parents are nice um so the kids are nice them for the faculty as nice blah blah blah blah blah but boy talk about\nA a lack of good judgment I understand that you wanna do something to celebrate the kid's positive behavior but\nHaving them stand to form an image of a great white shark that just a few weeks ago killed a man off of a wealthy sleep each killed them\nAnd then four weeks before that another great white shark or maybe it was the same great white shark I don't know no one knows mauled another man who is still in rehabilitation from that attack\nAnd you folks down and chat um at the elementary school with all due respect or so nothing in the brain that you actually think it's a good idea to have little children\nForming a picture of a great white shark\nNot only am I got to tell you not only a lack of judgment on the part of the parents the school principal whomever the superintendent of schools are is down there\nYou a faculty members I don't expect the little kids to know better but the faculty and the school principal and the ...\nBritain and the schools you should have known better than to do something like this talk about disrespecting somebody who's debt because of a great white shark attack\nAnd another guy who probably will never walk normally again because of her great white sharks and you folks are down there like it's an amusing thing to have little school age kids make an image of a great white shark it's wrong with you\n\nI understand if you had a smiley face that you wanted them to make or ah the school symbol whatever that may be that I guess\nBut the image of a great white shark I got to tell you everybody the thinking on this issue with the sharks is bizarre and its way off the mark on the part of locals just my opinion in any of that I didn't want to mention that and you want to take a look at what I'm Talking about I posted it up on my Facebook page Patrick ... wall Perkins news ...\nThat the election is November six but Massachusetts voters don't have to wait until the end of details on that we'll check the forecast for

I think for the boomers I I don't think you're seeing any meaningful change in behavior at\nThe snow I like a lot of my friends still have mortgages are poll question today is\nDo you still have a mortgage and or do you think that you will have a mortgage when you retire and if you are already retired to stay in his answer us honestly do you still carry a mortgage on your house you you're you're Seventy two years old\nYou've been retired for six years or are you still carrying a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar mortgage or a home equity line of credit that that's the other thing I see ... is a lot of people use home equity as a and there are lines of credit in retirement years so we'll ... we'll see what the answers come by\nOr we were talking earlier about making millions it's gonna be one point six billion so we bought tickets for a billion wouldn't we be buying tickets for one for six but\nYou would think so I mean and and keep in mind that one point six I think is going to go up before the uh the jackpot is a is revealed that weekly is make notes twice a week it's a it's Tuesdays and Fridays I Believe um and then Powerball I think It's Wednesday and Thursday Powerball by the way still has not been one either\nAnd that's now up to six hundred and twenty million if you get to point two billion dollars now up for grabs on these two jackpots here\nThe I I did the math the other day though so the odds on the mega millions are so bad it's one in three hundred and two million dollars right there when it when you three hundred and two million oh my gosh you think about you know the perspective if you buy twenty million dollars worth of tickets you know you have a one percent chance of winning your odds are still terrible\nYeah and that's true and I are\nStill determined [laughter] cutters taking\nHis draft Kings' lost his enrolling them over into mega millions so he's\nHe's taking a hopefully he's not taking his home downpayment fund and putting it in a bag and I hope the letter that he has his wife is as rock that account up I think about how nice\nOf a house you'd be able to buy for one point six billion dollar I Know\nWhat I look at it you know the I don't know it's a one point six and ... so there'll be a drawing tomorrow night\nIf it's going to be tomorrow night one point six by the way the funny thing on this so you drive past any of the stores that have the mega millions and you know they list the jackpot and hey here's how much is available\nIt can't lift how much is available because only has three digits

uh this retirement expense has hit one hundred thousand dollars annually and it's continuing to rise we're talking about the cost of care we're talking about assisted living facilities and we're talking about specifically nursing homes cost of this stuff\nIs just going through the roof yeah and the median cost of a private room in a nursing home is about a hundred thousand a year that obviously is being nationwide costs when you talk about the cost in the northeast and it really anywhere on the east coast anymore not in the middle of the country you're talking significantly higher than that\nUm and so this is one of the biggest things that I think people\nYou know don't necessarily have a clear plan for just because\nIt's really hard to plan for a hundred thousand dollars a year that you're going to be spending on something like this and a lot of cases not very many people that can afford it no I mean you you look at what most people have saved you know they might have a couple of hundred thousand dollars total and so if each spouse ends up spending a year or two in a nursing home they could wipe out the entire state in in the blink of an ...\nYou know the uh I've gone through this process with family members and uh recently had a family member that is going through and now they're not in the New England area they're out in Arizona but the cost of it is about

you die it that that's gone you get did not on that and the family gets none of that four hundred thousand ... okay and then you're paying a hefty fee every month you're paying you know upwards of six seven thousand dollars a month\nPart of which again is going to be tax deductible\nToo do you think there's anything\nOut there that ever bend the cost curve on this in order to make it more affordable 'cause you know ... years I've done the math and like people say oh gee I Can't believe that you know a nursing home costs Fifteen thousand dollars a month or something I mean you do the math and you say okay first of all\nHow much would you pay to live in a hotel room on a nightly basis you'd say okay if it's you know kind of a middle of the road if you're looking you know what the

among prime age us women\nTwenty five to fifty four has risen to Seventy five point two percent from Seventy three point three percent three years ago what can we learn from what what's the what's the lesson to be learned from an increased number of women in that age group working I think there's\nThere's two things that I really gleaned from it number one uh I think that the cost of running a household today is much higher than it was previously and so you have more families with two spouses working at the number one or the second piece is that we have not seen a similar\nBounce back for men over that time span and as a result I think you look at that and you say why are you know that it raises more questions for me and that wire men not coming back into the workforce at the same rate is a drug addiction\nI'm sure that the well I so I don't know because I don't know of drug addiction more men are addicted to drugs that I'm Talking about the opioid crisis if you look at the number I haven't seen the numbers of how how ... like I I'm going to\nUm I don't want to I don't want to put it out there but I I\nI'm going from memory and that memory is failing but I Know a lot more men die from a opioid addiction than women\nCause I'm looking I'm pulling up the numbers right now so if we look at uh males age yeah middle age twenty five fifty four is pretty much flat over the last three years you know it's up slightly from about ... ... yeah so what about one percent\nWhat does this do to the birth rate the fact that more women are they going back to work because they had kids and they need money to pay for college or are they simply not having kids and that's why there's more women\nI don't know if you can glean enough from this data to be able to say that now you know it's ... it's really hard to be able to say when this is happening just because it ...\nIt's not happening just in the United states either this is going on in Canada Australia in the u._k. women are becoming a much larger percentage of the workforce\nYet in it and I think again when you have I think a de academy is strong enough that you know you have people coming in who were enticed by better job offers that they might have gotten a few years ago but it's also more expensive to run a household today you know you talked\nSent it to pay for daycare like eight so ... you know like if you want to be if you want to have a kid\nI mean you've got to make a lot of money to justify going back to work for the day is bring your child to work to it would not be nice [laughter] it's just the

Medicare tax on every penny you could make a million bucks and you're paying that Medicare tax on a million dollars or learning\n... one thirty two nine hundred them and it looks like a that is let's see um the top five Ninety three point five percent so there's about six and a half percent of people that are going to be affected\nBy this they just means that you know next paycheck you're you're paying that fake attacks and it's a big tax it's a flat tax\nIt is if if you're self employed you're paying all of the twelve point four percent if you are employed by a company you pay six point two percent in the company pays six point two percent\nAs well people forget that you know they they talk about tax rates right they say Oh nice my tax rates thirty five percent nuts on forty one percent gotta factor that in and then they forget about the state well you've got thirty five percent is another five ... of the state mhm in most cases not Florida\nA normal retirement age is increasing by two months that's just that's part of the I think that went into effect in the Nineteen nineties where they pushed out the retirement age [noise]\nYeah it was one of the things that they did in order to make the program more sustainable it's going to be something they have to do again in what they want to you know deal with the funding issues are that the trust fund has or rather is going to have in about\nFourteen years now and he can make a little bit more money and those of you who collect your Social Security early you can earn a little bit more money without suffering a reduction in your benefit in those early years you know sixty two to sixty seven\nYeah if you retire before full retirement age will now be able to earn Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars a year up from Seventeen thousand forty uh that's what you'd be able to earn with out it affecting your benefit great question that a lot of people have actually look if you are retiring in a given year let's say you retire in July\nThey have that year a lot of people have a question hey can I earned income prior to that that's an excess of that\nThe answer is yes or if you are turning full retirement age and twenty Nineteen you can earn up to forty six thousand nine twenty in the months prior to turning normal retirement age but if you were in more than that than Social Security with old one dollar for every three dollars above the limits\nA lot of money a lot of money a U.S shale has a glaring problem this is one this and unfortunately our friends in Saudi Arabia are aware of this yeah we're producing a lot of oil in the United states I think we're we're the largest producer in the world now her first second largest read\nProbably depends on the given week but we're right in the ballpark yeah problem is we are losing money doing it\nWell it's so here's what's interesting is in particular this was looking at a review of thirty three quote publicly traded oil and gas fracking companies so this is just companies that are involved\nA in oil and gas fracking not companies that are uh you know just have that as a portion of their business but purely ones that do that\nAnd what it found um were that these thirty three companies ... they combined three point nine billion dollars in negative cash flow in the first half of twenty Eighteen ...\nNegative cash flow in the short term doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be negative in the long run is that because you get a lot of ... or ... they didn't break it out really so it's hard to say where it's coming from ... um but it's it's something that I think could be a little bit of a red herring just because\nIt could be that they're just investing a ton of money right now because they think oil prices are going to continue\nTo move up for it and so I'm curious to see what this looks like on a consistent basis just you know obviously we've seen this report here\nWhat was it a year ago what was it two years ago you know is is this something that's changing here\nYou know because companies are adding so much capacity in the U.S right now we've seen us capacity go for about eight and a half million barrels a week up to eleven million or a day rather up to eleven million barrels a day over the last two and a half years it could just be they're adding a ton of capacity and that's what's going on here\nStill a distribution issue ultimately though isn't it they we we either don't have the ports are we don't have the pipelines to get it where we need it because we theoretically we shouldn't be exporting any oil if we had enough pipelines to get where we needed because a lot more profitable to export [noise]\nYeah but it should it ever be more ... like if you think about where we can export it to export to China why should we have to ship it all the way to China shouldn't it be less expensive to send it to the northeast by pipeline than shipping it to China on a barge\nWhat they think it is less expensive that's why you ship it to China instead because the more profitable because again they're they're China is now the biggest ... oil in the world they have the demand and they don't have the production I understand and they need to be able to pay for this or eat\nAt all in the ... your your produce because most of our oil is coming from the Permian Basin Texas right oh it's it's scattered I mean you've\nGot big deposits now that are showing up in like in Colorado you've got to know the colonel production though is it the largest come and I think it's about thirty percent that's in Texas\nSo you've got your biggest blood coming out of there and we're still importing between what we buy from Canada and in our friends in the middle east we're still importing a good seven million barrels a day yeah so what are my point is if if you had\nA distribution system would you really need to be exporting at all but ... what when you'd be better oh you mean\nBy distribution system pipelines well how do you think the oil's getting to the\nPorts it is ... the ... we can't get natural gas to the northeast and we can't get oil to the north\nNet gas is a different issue so I think when when we look at ... gas that's a very separate issue that's local to the northeast and and that's because we haven't built pipelines\nBut if you look at how you know oil is flowing around most of the country right now it's it's not a pipeline issue to get it to most places aside from the northeast now you know the northeastern isolated issue but it's of its own making you know they they thought because we won't allow the pipelines that's the big thing if you look at the entire rest of the country they don't have the same issues\nI don't hate coming up we're going to tell you why you should no longer put your vodka in the freezing I thought everybody put their vodka in the freezer has just like what you're supposed to do the evidently I was wrong right refrigerant America's got
