D. I. C.\nTraders are making a lot of money betting against your Facebook you're Amazon your Netflix your Google how are they doing this job\nThey're making a lot of money by a basically shortening the stocks what does that mean uh you're you're basically borrowing with the intent to buy it back so I Try let's say I own shares of Amazon right you boil them for me what do I charge you ... I'm not gonna give them the I'm not going to lend them to you for free you gotta pay me rent\nYeah I mean I I'm not really up on a ... I've never shorter stock myself you're always along [laughter]\nI either don't buy it or I buy it I don't say\nWe have to rent the stock before you sell it right it's not free ... and sometimes if it's a ... stock you got to pay a lot of interest when you're borrowing yeah in fact my\nBrokerage company said if I Would put my stock that I own available for someone else to short ... like it'd be compensated for that\nBut traders are doing that and the other thing is you know they're just buying it and they're they're they're selling it in by back like you said which essentially is with short selling is there and people are turning against these talks with very big way the problem is when you get a momentum stock that just rides literally on his momentum\nOnce the music stops and turns negative there's just no went underneath the stocks and you know we talked about the fact that Amazon is just the most unbelievable company possibly of this of the century\nBut it just the stock itself just begin to it took about a life of its own you know and I think we both as people like what is it worth and when you asked that question they just kind of give you a blank stare\nYeah they couldn't get that that was the the challenge and it continues to be a challenge with Amazon because I look at the two big challenges that I look at\nFor Amazon is you know they have this Web services business yeah and there's been an absence and an arrogance from their competitors right their competitors have just basically said oh you can't build that business and they did and they stole a lot\nOf clients from companies like Microsoft IBM you know you look at IBM as terrible company right to own and and why I bought IBM [laughter] yeah but you just look at it I mean it's it's it's got the CEOs incompetent\nAnd and and you know and now she's making this deal for red hat and then which is up you know but I you know Hail Mary pass okay I'm In and they're now IBM's going to try to compete with Amazon because I think they're going to have merging compression with that business\nAnd then everybody and their brother is trying to get into the online sales states that hard it is it targeted as a formidable [noise] you know whether you like the company or not they they the the very formidable competitor Walmart\nWalmart has killed companies for for forty years they've they've you know think about what they did they they know how to compete and their and their online growth percentage wise is probably going to be ahead of Amazon this year yeah but it's just a moment a miniscule but the the fact is they the Amazon woke up the sleeping giant\nAnd ... and it's the targets here the Macy's a little way there it's everybody's got a little chunk of this and at some point people going to say why do we need them yes that was proprietary me up the idea of selling stuff online delivery in two days very cool in two thousand Thirteen but at the same time right now I've I have both\nAnd I have found that Walmart is consistently less expensive film about half the product so that's\nLike your face the whole swiping thing is is that you know like you know like swiping yeah but I mean the bottom line is a you know all these things that are that the other thing is that all these things that are improvements in\nOur fixing the problem that doesn't exist like I noticed each phone upgrade the first few generations while the ... the great the camera was noticeably different\nI Can't tell the difference between seven and eight and nine and they're all fine mess up so they're trying to fix problems that don't exist and they're trying to create but at the same time you got to take your hat off the apple because they're getting more money per phone ... than they've

that that didn't sustainable\nInsurance John you know and uh when we talked last time one of the questions you had that we didn't get to was one of your favorite topics regarding the evidence is the coverage ratio oh yeah\nRight yup ...\nYou know that's a you know the the ... year old is something that uh I'd back into you know I don't start off the screen trying to find the high yield stocks I look for you know the first thing is they've got to jump over all of the\nPre Ware requisite hurdles and that the number one is coverage ratio yep so the T o ... is coverage ratios one point six five based on free cash flow\nOkay um that that's all right it means for the time being it's safe or you know that but you liked the company that's the bottom line is is you know ultimately the company that sustains that\nRight the first thing I'd look for is a long term growth story that's the that's the that's the number one thing starting from there and and as we talked about before a fee to gross story first PPO it is a you know unlimited right now because they're right in the sweet spot\nFor the transition defied G ... are just as there\nAre no backing out of their legacy a cash flows\nOkay other company you're looking at a is icon enterprises now I think is Carl Icahn is more of a a corporate raider than investor but I assume you like him as an investor\nI sure do you know I follow the call for for many many years ... and um you know right now uh\nI feel in the current market environment that we're in what I'm what I'm looking for is a lot of cash flow and cash is king liquidity is going to be a premium right now because I feel I don't feel like we're in the middle of the big one you know so I think this\nRecent pulled back as a buying opportunity\nAnd uh I haven't I haven't I'm not long IEP yet I'm Still looking at over but he's got a lot of cash it's Ninety percent owned by call they just are\nSold out you know like you're you're a you know most people know him for the corporate raider aspect to his reputation but he's also great investor I don't know if you remember how we invested in apple and then really came out great on that so uh it's got a lot of liquidity four billion dollars though\nAnd that did it in like if he's got the liquidity is that that's a very high dividend they have you think that is all sustainable\nYes it's it's a the a pale ratio is eighty seven percent that's kinda high according to them you know it is but ah it's Ninety percent owned by by call I'm of the shares at low key actually\nOkay oh where where they are

I Love Costco and I'll be just two of my favorite shopping destinations yup Cosco is are there Black Friday is is you don't ironically it's on friday I I I thought we were not doing this story so I got really they they normally open their stores\nYet at ten of them they're going to open up on a November twenty third at nine AM\nAnd you know this is a game that it's gotten more competitive and less competitive depending on how you look at in a there was that rush to get everybody to work on Thursday and people got really mad at that\nCompany started to realize hey we're working we can push a lot of our business online do the same sales have people might have to wait in long lines\nHave people not killing each other in long lines right and at the same business and give our employees a break so that's kinda nobody wants to work on Thanksgiving you know in an online world it seems like abuse now well you know if I don't have to be there why am I there and then all kinds of awful things are happening right\nPeople killing each other to get the big screen TV yeah\nLike that wasn't good enough no you know in in the previous hour I I said I Wish the president periodically would just shut up shut the hell up Mr President yesterday that the market took a tumble ... based on his comments regarding tariffs\nYeah I saw it hit the tape and he said that we're just going to put tariffs and everything yeah and we're we're looking at the end and that's when we went down five hundred points to market was started the day up to fifty was down to close to an changed the midday and then it just went into freefall after that\nBut then John Mooney this morning comes in and says it's OK buried [laughter] 'cause you just said that uh he thinks he's going to what ... what does he think now today what what time is it is he may have changed his mind but he said oh we're going to get a great deal out of China\nHe he mentioned overnight and the only reason I mentioned this is a big deal is because the the Chinese market reacted very favorably to this and I look we're just grasping at straws here you know there's a lot of back and forth there was a threat yesterday that just sunk the market overnight I think Trump ... maybe should have said that it but that's why he should shut [laughter]\nYeah well you you know the market's going up and down based on a tweet about the border fine right shut up about the market and the terrorists\nWell we have an ongoing negotiation in a in a war of words ... with a she is in China I your bottom line here is the Chinese are going to do nothing between now and next Tuesday to make Donald Trump look good he should under\nStand that they're not going to do that how bad is going to be next Tuesday a I've got how much how much power the socialists going [laughter] I've got\nThe Democrats picking up thirty five seats and I in this in the house I've got the Republicans picking up to in the Senate and that gets us to a place where we were the last two years of Obama where gridlock\nYeah you're going to have a government by executive order I think you'll see reduced um you know you see some stuff in the regulations run reduced more more you know and then you'll deal with issues like a possible Supreme Court nominees and the Democrats will simply a\nBring up investigations into who was doing what what time freshmen in college and said bad stuff and let's look into it so yeah but they won't have the power to do anything\nAnd there are Republicans won't have all that much power to initiate much legislation so I think

other countries as the trade war bites into profits this according to a business survey that was done John this is really the nightmare scenario for China this is why their economy is crumbling this is why their currencies devaluing and this is why their stock market's down\nDramatically here today this is yet another example of them arguably the most glaring example of why this really could hurt China a lot of when you start seeing this this really does bite into their economy so what we're seeing as we're seeing collateral damage on both sides\nClearly China has more to lose than we do a which is adding some urgency clearly there markets have reacted even more adversely than our markets although our markets are starting to do poorly this month I'm so these are the stakes were were experiencing is nothing\nCompared to the Chinese John absolutely uh you know the impact of this for the United states will be\nPretty small now um it it it may have an inflationary impact\nIt may make

come to some sort of agreement I mean I'm not sure we can why should Boeing have to pay for an issue that has to do with apple\nI mean when it comes down to I mean I I Know what you're saying I I feel like we can address both you know I'm not sure we can all I'm losing you know because I don't trust them John on anything I don't trust them as far as I can throw them it's just like I don't trust the Saudis\nYeah I ... if this is the case we're gonna have to really rely on domestic consumption and the consumption of allies now we're going to have a new world we're willing to work at a
