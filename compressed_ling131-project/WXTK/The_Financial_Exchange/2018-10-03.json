negative eight point two percent\nWow so you've got a proxy for China because China never tells the truth it's a\nProxy for China and forward demand in the U.S and so the last time that we saw numbers like this from South Korea mhm was back in late twenty Fifteen early twenties sixteen when we are all that money coming out of the global economy because of oil prices crying\nSo this is one of those things where I take a look at the chart and this number by the way if you go back a year okay\nA year ago that number was ... plus thirty four percent\nYou know the ... and a lot of people would have thought that number would be increasing because you're hearing about American companies like a Costco stockpiling Walmart is stockpiling product because they're anticipating these tariffs\nAnd and I think what this suggests to me you could see\nThat what could you know you mentioned hey you know not enough workers can kick off the next recession\nIt could also be what we call an inventory recession where companies have stockpiled so much product that they say look we don't need to order anything else in factory orders low for a couple of quarters and it puts you into a mild recession that doesn't mean the world comes to an end but it it does mean that hey you might see a little pull back and markets as we go forward twelve for Eighteen months\nYou know it is interesting the feds you yesterday a drone Paulos in Boston talking and he said you know I I'm not worried about labor markets overheating [noise]\nBoy I Am I I like I must be the only person that's concerned about it I I look at what's going on with with Amazon just did\nA and with other companies having difficulty hiring workers not a day goes by where we don't report on labor strikes for somebody's going out on strike or work or like a Mariette workers just went out on strike [laughter]\nWhat's the problem with labor markets overheating\n[noise] it means that wages go up and in the short term corporate profits go down why is that a bad thing\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing in the long term in the short term it can cause us if all of a sudden Mariette Mrs their earnings estimates\nQuarter after quarter because they have to pay their workers more money or Amazon or a BJ's or Cosco all these companies have to pay more money for their workers in the short term it hits their earnings per share and Wall Street will cause those stocks to go down may not be bad for the economy in the economy might actually benefit from higher wages to lower paid work\nIn my view also is that stress is stress stress is what produces forward progress in technology and in the economy it's when you have a company that saying gee we can't figure out how to meet earnings because our cost of going up to watch it if not a question of hey we don't have enough sales we can make it said what what what ... what can we do to innovate\nTo figure out how to to generate better profits and I like to see that 'cause that's where a company like Marriott says\nGee you know what we're going to figure out a way we're going to get better technology for our cleaning staff so that instead of cleaning eight rooms day they can do nine and instead of\nUh having our kitchen working this way we're going to have that I like to see that I liked companies that are a little stress because it forces them to innovate sure I don't like when companies are all comfortable saying oh gee we got low borrowing costs in low wage like what if companies had to do the last eight years to make money hasn't been too hard\nIt is it and they haven't had to innovate\nTucker or when your son is born are you going to limit\nHis screen say son\nYeah even though you're having to do you yeah oh okay okay pretty sure I could ask how you

this and the more that you read the more scared you have to be about the use of technology on a regular basis in if you really\nGot limited not just I I think for adults as well but if you're raising a child\nIs that's where it brain developments happening and everything\nYeah and then you take you know said screen away from the child and then they get more and more aggressive it seems like you know they they just get more the angry when one of the big problems are pointing out is\nThey're spending so much time these kids like ten years old eight years old ... years old and they're not getting any physical exercise that I ... and so that all seen\nThe movie wall e where it's a bunch of fat people sitting around around chairs because they can't move\nFor you that I think is part of the behavioral issues ... you know if if a kid that age they have so much energy if they're not getting exercise that that can't be good yeah you get a run around\nThe exercise and you know just normal socialization not you know trying to present an image on social media to all your friends but actually talk to you know human beings and said yeah he like what's actually going on I think it
