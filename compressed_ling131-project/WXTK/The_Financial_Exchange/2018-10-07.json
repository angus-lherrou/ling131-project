{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "But a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that actually\nI was just such an offensive as like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off and actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure it's okay but he did it yes so then you can see all the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this that you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know and sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily a strict with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy\nThe horror right you'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a kid's costume\n... and what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who are you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah and\nOf course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you season\nWhen it's too late when someone's already going into the nursing home and you're saying okay now what do we do and you find out you're denied

real life stories so Todd when I'm looking at this guy I see the first page is all about\nWhat should be included in your trust me and then you have several pages dedicated to\nBalance these problematic trust provisions that you've run into over the year when reviewing other trust for people who are\nAttending fair hair on their behalf trying to get these things to work I Want to start with the problems\nThat's a great as I Know you had a lot of illusions are things but some of the things that people really should be looking for that should not be included in their ... one of the things you've included here is trigger language can you explain what you mean by that yeah\nIt it's usually goes with trigger or termination language you can kind of a couple of those two together so if you have language in there that says and grants any kind of discretion\nFor the distribution of principle but limits the exercise of the discretion saying that it can't be exercised if in fact\nKnow it's needed for nursing home or for payment of medical expenses and things like that\nThat would be a problem that would actually cause and there's a a Cohen case in a cancer case out there that say hey language like that discretionary limiting language needs to be disregarded okay you can't limit\nThat so where do we do\nWe just prohibited yeah right there is no ever know discretionary language\nIn our trust that says principal can come out to to do nor mhm under any circumstance okay so don't put discretionary language around it and don't give the right to terminate I kinda tied the two together that's kind of a trigger some don't give the right of the trustee to terminate\nThe trust and distribute out all the assets to to uh beneficiary because terminated\nOn on what grounds\nThey might think it's too big to manage too small to manage is not becoming economically efficient to manage\nThose language that language exists for our revoke about trust but not for are irrevocably medicate trust so know termination clause should be in your trust either\nAnd you know you talk about having that language in there about kind of under different circumstances having that money come out of the trust what about the flipside of that where you have one of your problematic provisions is silence as to the distribution of principle why would that be a problem\nAnd you know that that's probably ... and and this is not only one of the biggest problems of drafting these trust but the easiest problem to spot especially if you're a lay person\nLook at your document there's gonna be a paragraph that says during the life of a creator the don't or big bold usually in the middle right underneath that section you'll find a paragraph that explains what can be done\nAnd there should be a paragraph granting the distribution of income\nTo you don't or but right after that you must see a paragraph that prohibits the distribution of principle under any circumstance to the don't or it cannot come out\nThat being said if that is not there that one little paragraph is not there mhm and it just says income can come out and then the next sentence is\nUpon the death of the donor or mhm which means they completely ignored paragraph just just left it off\nYou're going to lose on that case wow they're going to say if you go to a a fair hearing or even perhaps superior court I don't know but if you go to a fair hearing they're going to say under the uniform a trust code\nThere are such broad trust the powers that if in fact there is not a prohibition on\nThe distribution of principle or the prohibition on anything any one item then you can do it so if it's not prohibited you can't do it and therefore it's going to be at risk for the nursing home to make sure that paragraph isn't there\nWas so good to be really careful with that folks there so much you need to be careful foreign there's there is a couple of yet ... five other six other no wait there's more but wait there's more there's a lot of problem trust provisions that taught and he was looted and you know yeah there is an awful lot of\nIssues that you want to avoid ... you don't want to be saying okay my husband's in the nursing home my wife's in the nursing home but we're good we have this trust and then find out right oh well your trust us island is a principal and I think it's\nThe way they lay it out in there will be easy for you and you know you simply read the bad paragraph and read the explanation as to why it's bad and you can yeah try to do it in English for you so you can understand it and\nI Try and hands late lawyer to English for you folks doesn't always work on the air [laughter] I Try well you know what\nYou did not go to law school folks but fortunately for all

sing when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything including the big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan ... or\n... a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Bob\nIn Hyannis mess and Bob rights can I buy my mother's house from her at a discount and let her live their rent free for the rest of her life in exchange for that discount she's having a hard time keeping up with the mortgage payments and I'm In a position to help her out\nThe sale would leave her with around a hundred thousand in proceeds after she pays off the mortgage if she ends up going into a nurse\nSeeing how would this be an issue with Medicaid if she sells it to me at a discount even if it is in exchange for a living rent free\nLove people being creative whole isn't as mine had a loophole liquor\nIs is an interesting created position or creative position to take 'em what's in ... and yeah I Can't just answer it without a little analysis uh-huh\nSo first what are we doing whatever you anybody out there wants to sell property below fair market value which is what they're doing here\nYou are technically running into something that is called a part sale part gift okay and the IRS willing knowledge it as a parts sale part gift so arguably if I sell a piece of property that's worth five hundred thousand for\nFour hundred thousand I've made a one hundred thousand dollar gift mhm and a four hundred thousand dollar sale okay so what does that mean to the Sadler\nTechnically you should file a gift tax return and acknowledge your gift of one hundred thousand dollars mhm won't result in a capital gains oh I'm Sorry it won't result in a\nTaxable gift because you will simply eat into your eleven million currently eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar federal gift tax exemption mhm by the hundred grand\nForget the present interest exclusion let's just say by the hundred grand okay no tax for the ... for the giver right\nAnd no tax in Massachusetts because there's no gift tax and there's no gift tax in any state if you're listening except Connecticut so ... I don't know if you're in Connecticut All right so I I get it that's a good deal shoes me a good call\nWhat's happening on the Medicaid front ... that was the gift tax front on the Medicaid front\nWe have this problem a five year weight has just been created\nBecause it's a disqualifying transfer at least as to the part that would be considered a gift in other words something you gave away and did not get fair market value in return for the piece that wasn't fair market value would be I Would think\nWould be considered a gift and you have a five year waiting period for Medicaid eligibility in case\nA mom got sick\nAfter this transaction yet even though she's living there\nOkay I get all that so do I still want to do it maybe it's okay I Would say no because I never ever want to give assets to children one I'm living\nNothing good can come from that mhm so those are the first two problems next I don't own any more son can kick me out anytime you want I can sell it I don't get the proceeds are exposed\nTo my son's creditors who could have a divorce and I could lose my house through to their divorce\nOn and on and on and tax problems so nothing good comes from that one other problem I see\nIf I successfully given it away arguably I've lost the ability to get a step up and basis on the property especially here we are doing it sort of in exchange for the ability to live there\nI Know there's this case out there called the state of Gwen that allows people who give away assets to continue to enjoy what they give away yeah causes it to be included in their state\nTo preserve the step up and basis so at least I think Bob you'll probably be able to avail yourself of that case\nAnd if you sell the property after mom dies you might not have a capital gains tax problem [noise]\nBut you know what there's so many other problems here that I wouldn't do this ... I Would say Bob you can be in the very same place while protecting Mumbai having mom put it in this trust that we talk about here designing this trust\nPut it in still a five year waiting period mom can live their moms in charge no risk of being kicked out mom can sell the property mom can avail herself the capital gains tax exclusions and you're going to get a full step up and basis when\nMom passes\nAll the while the property protected from the nursing home mhm why would I give\nIt away right there is no benefit in doing that Bob or anybody listening\nYeah and you know what folks if you've been thinking about doing planning to protect those assets get your clock started\nEven if you do get your clock started make sure it started with the right type of document make sure that that ... trust is drafted properly\nTaught is written a brand new guide for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust and we know the status scrutinizing these applications that go in

strong element an incredible woman who helped a\nRaise me and my two brothers um we're ah we're lucky to have her around yeah she's a she's at my house today with my my my wife and my two daughters and I\n... my my oldest daughter so happy to to be with me me and hang out with her that it's it's great to see brings a smile to my face so she angry and she's a of a woman so [noise]\nWell I have a problem I bought this house that two and a half years ago and it's a ... in the middle of the God [noise] and it has a flowered but to me is that what they said Patrick I Want to just get rid of it how do I go about doing that\nWell so you know one of the things you can do is try to cut as much of it as possible down to the ground okay leaving a little bit of that there was like to see you do is take a a weed killer um you can use a burn out from\nA bona fide it's a it's an anti weed killer\nOn like you do is after you've cut\nThe trumpet find down yes bulldozed\nGOP plant that's left on the ground I Want you to actually take the concentrate and paint it on to the to the roots itself instead of spraying it\nAnd they have to be on freshly cut because the whole gay or quicker and easier and be better for you [noise] um\nBut you can definitely cut it down to where you can find and then spray that into it or painted into it\nIt's probably going to take a couple of times and you might not be able to get it all this year you're probably going to need to do it again in the spring having ... times or to do that so that that's what I Would look to do a burn out from a bone ad is a great organic product to do that\nVery good oh still glad and like I\nLike I said okay let's take a couple applications All right not just one application or you're going to need to continuously do this it might be a little bit late in the season at this point to have to do it multiple times are but in the spring you\nCan do what every ten to fourteen days but I like what I'd like to see is any of that growth that you're seeing is have a fresh cut on it or you um spray or or paint it\nAll right how\nAre you showed that come up all over the place for late die off\nWell you're gonna have to hit those that's where some of this is going to be the hard part for the sheets are coming in every where you're going to have you tried to get as much as you can\nAnd this'll be the quick the easiest way to do it or you can just try to dig out as much as I don't fix it but yeah yeah I think it's just going to take too much time to do that why am I saying that the\nThe thing you need to look at it as make sure there's no surrounding plants that you know are into these routes\nOh yeah when you're when you're spraying this that's one of the reasons why I was saying to paint it onto the stamps cat so that way you're not spraying the other plants around it your spring you really just getting that a Trump to find that you're trying to eradicate okay\nFine well thank you very much burn out from oh night\nYes it's it's a great organic product um if you don't want to use that you could use um [noise]\nA ... a a vine and stumped killer a firm bona fide that is a chemical um I Would do it the same exact way a painted on there it might be a little bit faster but burnout inorganic might do well for you\nAll right thank you very much gastric again I'm awfully sorry about your dad\nThank you willing for the phone call and thank you for your condolences like we do appreciate it are my family does appreciate thank you how much\nOkay thank you bye\nBye [noise] All right guys we're wrapping up about twenty seconds left so everybody out there uh enjoy the beautiful day get out and\nGardens and uh you know like I like I Try to stay at the end get out their gardens plant some things and really be good to each other because that's all we got is each other so enjoy the rest of your week was the next time\n\nThe latest from ABC News monitor what they were on Brett Kavanaugh is now the newest member of the nation's highest court and President Trump he celebrate\nTo go [laughter] and I say gee I said I didn't see the coin flip ... but\nWe could go for an hour and a half on this point I suppose are due to Ron Bergstrom again welcome glad you're here Sarah and the floor is yours\nOkay well thanks pat and I like to think there'll be likes TK for this chance to inform the Cape voters about this race it's an important race it covers the entire Cape ... province town\nUm and also the opportunity to show how I Believe a Cape Cod regional government can be an even stronger and even more relevant player in helping to our towns meet the challenges that we face in the next few years and the challenges pretty formidable [noise] the first of all give your listeners a little background about myself\nUm I currently serves as chat um delegate to the assembly of delegates which is the county's legislative body um I've served on these simply now for a dozen years of for eight of those years my colleagues had enough respect for me I Hope to uh to appoint me as speaker\nUm until I stepped down two years ago now I'm currently chair the Finance Committee\nBefore that I served for twelve years as a slick met in my town of Chatham\nA and I'd like to have a comment about that I was on the border to select ... during the time the Chatham\nPursued a wastewater management plan through the regulatory process and eventually to town meeting approval and that's important because that's one of the primary challenges to Cape it's going to face\nIn the next few years and uh unless we clean up our base in history where he's a we're going to have a problem down the road with our economy so I bring that experience to the table and I think that it's going to be a valuable experience that's going to be one of my priorities as county commissioner\nI also served on the regional transit authority and shared that body for a while and we extended a bus service but we also established Kate flyer which is the weekend service to Boston so I have a record of accomplishment behind me um\nBut the fact is that I didn't do those things by myself how I how I helped accomplish those things with by empowering people in place the administration the staff and volunteers\nThey're the real heroes when you when you get something done because they're the ones who do the hard work and they're the ones who bring the expertise table and I think that their contribution has to be appreciated and respected [noise]\nAh you know but ... says he's a dump former and I'm probably a dumb fishermen um but I Know one thing I Do know is that I don't have all the answers\nAnd that's why I rely on staff and I rely on the administration to give me advice county commission is are\nThere to set policy there ... there to set goals and not there to do the day to day administration of Orange County so I'm I won't have an office in the building if I'm elected [noise] um I have a perfectly good office in my basement of a little computer and a quarter [noise] um\nSo that's so why am I running well it's a tough race as I said from born to province town um I had to think long and hard about it um but eventually I felt that right now there's dysfunction among the county commissioners\nAnd that I could add a a a solution to that problem and you know I'm a Democrat I have progressive values I Believe in reaching out to the towns and seeing what we can do not taking a step back\nAll right but the final thing was that um we had a series of cuts are made to the budget one of the cuts was made to AmeriCorps AmeriCorp is is universally valued service we provide to the towns they did um traffic control when a an officer ... funeral they staffed the uh\nThe centers when we had those storms the um\nThe community centers when people had to go in because of the storms and um [noise]\nThe commissioners including Mr coon is decided to cut their staffing by\nA twenty five percent from thirty to volunteers down to twenty four so that was one of the key reasons not the only reason one of the reasons that I made me jump into the race as I say I have long experience\nI've been doing this for a while I don't play golf I'm too old for sports I get an appreciation for helping people get appreciation for the same things done well I Hope to bring that experience to the bottom bunch la county commissioner's office and I uh\nI Hope that people will support me\nRobert strum thanks appreciate that opening and now uh the Republican incumbent Leo cocoon is and Leo's opening comments\nWell thank you again a pet for having me here and thanks WRX decay and I had radio for doing this I think it's important to agree with my colleague on that I think it's an important informational six section two out people here in Boswell county to turn out and vote\n'em I could sit here and go through a list of accomplishments of the things that I've done and not done or the involvements that I've been in and certainly mostly all listened as I Know know me and most of the people who are the boards and committees of certain do I know me a Finance Committee in a town hall which\nCape Cod commission for six years assembly the delegates with Ron of for six years and then subsequently moved into the position of county commissioner in two thousand Fifteen\nWhat I really want to focus on in my opening statement is my accomplishments has county commissioner because that's what I'm here asking the boat has to do is to support me once again for another four years\nI've pretty much done everything I said I was going to do four years ago except for one thing\nAt that time four years ago I said I wanted to clear up\nThe route six rest area situation unfortunately because of the lack of leadership not only the state house\nBut certainly our leaders and the federal government\nI've reached a stumbling block I reached a block wall on that and we have not improved that situation since I've been your county commissioner and for that I Apologize but if I Am elected to go back it will be priority wanting to keep that on the table and try to at least accomplish of that one thing\nA list of very small accomplishments that I have done a as a county commissioner again when I was on the assembly delegates just one number I joined sparrow metric caucus and brought forth the idea to follow the charter for years\nThe county had been run by one gentleman as not only the a CFO but the finance director to direct conflict with the child of\nI put that ordinance forward as a county as a ah somebody delegates member and then as soon as they became a county commissioner I made a priority one to get us a new\nCounty administrator not the interim one and that that whole set up that we had for for about three years which made no sense of policies and procedures the county had none I brought forward a number of policies and procedures or which have been voted in\nAnd then certainly everybody remembers the state uh audits report that I joined our new county administrator jak units on asking state ought to just to come in\nA we have addressed every single thing in that state audit report and I will report they're very very soon I Do believe we will have cleaned up and address every single facet of it so\nI stay in here before you really running on my record as your county commissioner for the last three and a half years and I'm hoping that the the service that are provided and the time that I put in a will win me a a another four year term\nAll right Lee Curtis thanks for those just joining us You're listening to W. ... my name is pat does Maris and we're doing a debate bicycle county commissioners race between Leo cocoon is Leo is a Republican he is the incumbent ah he's being challenged by Ron Bergstrom who is a a Democrat and a I'm going to ask\nThe fellow some questions they both get ah to respond and then about ten thirty we open up the phone lines and the listening audience can ask questions themselves again the election is November six a run in the ... I think that this is an under appreciated a race\nAnd I think awful lot of voters a need to appreciate\nWhat county government or does he have a fabulous I think website if you go to that website\nAh there are ... will lay out for people all the things that county government does it really is educational you if you do a lot and I don't know that people realize how much a service that you do provide the Fifteen pounds on Cape Cod so I thought you respond to that no [noise]\nI still have not yet but I Will not had a having said that I think your race Ron in Leo in my opinion is a ... a referendum on the size and and the cost of county government and I think it's important\nHaving said that I'd like to start with you uh Leo and one of the things I've I've read and you told me when you've come on the radio show before\nA prior to your uh getting on the uh a partial county commission as a commissioner and then it as a chair would you describe for me in the audience\nAt the bar civil county governments fiscal situation prior to you getting on board the commission\n[noise] well I tried to put it in real simple terms or all of us at home when we have we balance a checkbook so we have a a a little bit of money left over that we we we call low in the county or ... or ... restricted reserves which is basically some extra money\nUm for years the county and run has supported these budgets by the way have balance the budget by taking in\nX amount of dollars let's say they bring in a million dollars in revenue\nAnd then the the budget is a million three well what do you do\nFor years the county has been spending\nA politician did come out and did give his personal opinion and what happened mayhem came of it\nAnd that's a pure indication that no single politician is going to stand up and take this issue on\nSo as to chair the county commission is with the backing of my fellow commissioners eye off it to host a meeting where all the players could get together and come to a solution and work on this issue as Jane who think the uh gray\nSeal population mostly on modern way better all around Cape Cod should that population ... absolutely\nWe do not have a shock problem we have a seal\n... Enron brushed them I just wanted to clear on this you disagree with that\nI think that we should I think we should we should lower the seal population below wow and how how Ron\nThat I'll leave that up to the experts I'll leave that up to the experts that is what a politician answer well no I mean I'm not I'm not going to go out there and start shooting them I mean that's the that's the obvious answer I'm not going to go out there and killed him that's ... that's the difference between myself and Leo Leo is kind of dancing around that\nI'm not the answer and and I have a specific solution I think we should be looking at first of all kinds of shots and for the males I we've been here I've been on the ... for a long enough to know that ten years ago we had maybe a hundred and fifty seals now we have thirty or forty\nThousand if we do nothing as the educated\nKeepers of this planet\nOkay and ten more years we're going to have three hundred and fifty thousand seals what's that going to do to every one of our beaches on the Cape and throughout fishing stuff I Want to move on to do in the ... to look at my reading and we have to look at calling and calling meetings taking them out if that means for food source then fine\n... yeah well ... when ... says that no single politician will take issue one obviously he's not including himself no I'm not I'm not afraid of losing votes wrong and that's why I've had that you're so much above the the average politician Leo you know the is so much more knowledgeable in so much more courageous congratulations\nThank you I appreciate that so excellent comment or we operator consider myself a lot smarter than most politician\nI Know that that ... All right\nUh if you're joining us you listen to W. ... a bicycle county commissioners race Leo cocoon is Ron\nBergstrom one last point before I have to break and we will open up the phone lines for the listening audience you'll get a chance to ask these fellows questions in just a few minutes but as I said my opening comments I'm concerned about two things shocks obviously is is one of the side things I'm important things I'm concerned about but\nCost which we covered I Want to talk about services and uh Leo your opponent here Ron has has gone after you quite a bit on services and county government ah to that you mentioned Ron quite a bit and we all want you to respond to it was mentioned in your openings this AmeriCorps have there been caught south yet way\nYes or no and secondly the human rights commission do you want to get rid of that if you could respond to those two points place\nOkay first of all the AmeriCorps situation there absolutely was cut as Ron mentioned it was thirty four we're down to twenty four members so they absolutely was a cut it had nothing to do with financial reasons do\nFirst of all ten of those are the ten that we cut six of those members would have been up at the national seashore under the fire corporate ... brigade the national ... said they didn't want them enough why Nineteen so there's six\nThe other four or a result of the fact that we had an adequate housing\nWe had Fifteen members living in a home that the county owns that did not meet basic living standards\nHas no way that I as one of the executive sitting as a county commissioner and owning a number of rental properties myself would want to have\nFamily members and trust their college educated son or daughter to send him to Cape Cod to have me allowed to live in substandard conditions\nSo that was a housing issue so if you're going to blame me for cutting you blame me for for because six where the national seashore didn't want any more and I am very proud to say that you're damn right I Would not have my daughter lives in that house and born with fourteen other people and nor would I Want people to interest me to have their sons and\nDaughters ... forgot about the human rights question I brought up around but I I'll give you a chance to respond to the American\nQuiet I unjust I understand Leo's concern about the housing my understanding is those people are still living in their today\nYou're wrong that house has been condemned by the board the fire marshal and have lived there and I always after you this issue came knowing they they lived there for three months afterwards Enron I didn't sleep all every one of those nights for those three months scared to death but something would happen to those young\nEducated young professional ... human beings who are coming here to provide service to or\nDo you stand by your comments Ron Bergstrom that a commissioner a cocoon is make cuts in America ... and\n... and I mean he's not a solidly I Will refreshes memory I remember the day it was presented to us and you ... you would not have done what he he didn't know\nI he his explanation which has since seemed to have forgotten was that the federal government the Congress the new Republican Congress was going to cut AmeriCorps funds and then we had to make a preemptive kind of a hundred thousand dollars 'cause we anticipated that our funds would be\nAll right and I had been on the cake for forty years I have never seen the property values go down and it's been predicted if you do this if you do that property values were drawn they consistently have gone up this to see us in the structure nothing to do with it higher credit for\nBirth control yeah sure don't\nThink you have thankfully I what I suggest interesting about the birth control question and there seems to be some division of opinion I notice but I think I'd also\nI had an idea and plan to actually build a manmade island ... ought to put off the coast I'm On the moisture we could attract the seals to go out there which would intend get them off our beaches and get the shocks away from swimming in shallow water run for your\nHealth we'll all very good suggestions I support all of them anything we can do to limit the seal population is absolutely right it hurts the fishing industry it's it's not good for the environment but the the weather's been put on the table so far has been calling and I have to make it clear that's not gonna work\nLet's go to John who's in Centerville John you're on with ... and Ron Bergstrom go right ahead with your question\nAll right so I was like I got a smoke bomb or ... you gotta go faster John you got to go fast [laughter] All right players simple fact when I was a kid we used to use fish and the God what's your question raised on yeah get rid of the seals make cat food fertilizer plant\nI'm hearing a comment not a question I'm gonna give you one more shot at this and you're gone\nAll right how are they going to handle this population\nRight I think we're pretty much kinda covered let's go to Adam in Brewster Adam you're on W. ex TK you're on with the candidates which question\nI thank you my question is on the human rights commission I'm a parent of an opposite high student and I've seen the human rights commission get into the school and make a drive in their agenda and make them schools and walk on the Cape conservative family All right\nUm [noise] what's gonna happen with the human rights commission I should be banned that it never should have been in government it's order size what are you going to do about it\n[noise] it's kind of covered this too but I'll give you one more shy again it goes to why I Believe that the current ordinance needs to be changed the people and volunteers at the county commission as a point to the human rights commission need to understand this is like governmentally operated thing and it needs to follow strict standards\nWe as a government have to protect everyone's civil rights everyone's whether we agree with them personally or not\nAnd this is a it's a very difficult thing for people with this kind of passion to do but under the current ordinance that does not make it as clear as it should be around ... am I going to give\nYou a chance to see her but glad for the chance or listen I support the human rights commission I supported been caught a bunch of accounting I Know those people they don't go outside the bowl\nParty you believe that your opponent wants to get rid of he has said he doesn't and his capacity as as a county commissioner and as chair do you believe that he wants to get rid of the the human rights commission do you believe that that's what he said and I believe in Leo you didn't say that though\nNo I said personally personally Leocha coolness bullies that the human rights commission would be better operated in serving the people have Boswell county as a private five oh one C. C. three and I stand behind that statement\nHowever as my colleague just pointed out it was I that brought to the table at the workshop the idea is to put forth a new ordinance to keep the human rights commission as pot of possible county\nSo I Know I can leave my personal beliefs outside when I'm representing the people of possible county they want it under the auspices of the county then this is my ideas to see move forward and stay under\nAdam thanks so much I Know I'm up against a bit of a break gene one last one and I promise a gene I'll take the brake Ron Bergstrom you have stated a number of times when you were on my radio show a while back you stated you said it in a newspaper articles commissioner on duty\nWouldn't you really prefer to be running against Ron ... and not Leo ...\n[laughter] well\nI Would prefer that run beauty wasn't a commissioner and if it's ... I became the vehicle to do that sure that would be fine I think he has poisoned the will\nOf uh of goodwill between us between the state between our delegation it's not so much that the people of of the Cape cod reject them is they did in the primary win ... against reading on the show so when you when you when you insult the governor and you insult or administrators you insult the people who you need to help you it doesn't help\nParties as fair for me is it fair for me run to to think though that in part you're running against Leo because you have problems with condition of beauty in part\nThe only part of that would be true is that if I'm elected we are going to switch the board of county commissioners to more progressive than proactive attitude showed in that case yes in a way it'll marginalize Mr baby because then he he will be on the outside your last word goes to\nA real ... I mean I you know I think it's ridiculous of cross runs running against him and of course you know he keeps saying we're the functional board really\nThis board has done more in the last two years since I've been ... accomplished in the previous twelve years and I can stand on that record aspect and I asked him if he also taught me how you got a man he also talks about bringing comedy to the board since I've been chair there's only been one time where was there was a two to one vote\nAnd it was Mary pat and Ron Beatty voting against\nTheir New Year's commissioner beauty will be up for reelection assuming he runs will you support his candidacy if you get back into office well even if\nYou don't get back you know that's a that's a tough one I Want to see who's running against them I Want to say something I Want to say something for the for the for the facts here too though Mr Beatty has sat next to me as a county commissioner and in two years has never once insulted anyone that has come before us on a public meeting\nHe's never once raised his voice at our meeting he's never once conducted himself in any minute demeanor that I Would consider as a as a bad demeanor for a public official ... what he does out in the public in his own where wages is one thing\nWe're out of time for this segment stay with us everybody will come back and we'll switch gears and Leo and Ron get to ask this ought to be interesting we're not taking any more questions they are they good they get to ask each other questions time flies when you're having fun\nYou're on with ... am I Am I get a chance am I going to get a chance to speak and this is this thing not quite yeah a little break we'll be back when we come back I I'll let you say what you will will news radio nine to go out of it is on the record news radio see five Seventy ...

I've gotten donations from a number of town Republican towns committees okay I strongly believe that that you know the Republican platform is you know that's why I'm a Republican\nSo if he were to have a Republican I'm a a\nA challenger in a primary I'd have to find out who that is you know I'm not going to stand there and say that I think ... should not be county commissioner quite frankly and again and I put this out there and I'm going to ask this question of my competitor what has he done\nThat is wrong sitting at that table he's conducted himself in a very professional manner as a commissioner shy of his personal twitters tweets out there in the world which he tends to formulate our president\nAs a county commissioner he is voted in and supported and worked on a number of different issues in the last two years so quite frankly how would I just vote against him because he's run no I'm not going to say that it today I'm not going to say that\nYou got your first question from uh Leo what's your well you know\nThis was another reason why I don't agree with the Leo's style is that he gives long emotional answers to very simple questions you know and and so I'll give you a very simple answer no I Would not support Ron Beatty obviously I wouldn't I'm a Democrat\nBut you know there are ... and I'm part of the Democratic organizations and see I Do see her on and on the Cape\nAnd I've supported democratic candidates and still do but there are lines that you don't crush I mean even if you're committed partisan their lines you don't cross to call 'em the survivor of the Parkland shooting show a shootings an opportunistic rap\nIs something that I think just qualified person from public service\nReally yes I Do I Know we have a lot of low lifes running out there and get elected but you know to me personally there are limits\nAnd ... has long since passed social limits and if a ... a ... right wing or left wing candidate came along who wanted to nationalize the industries and so on I wouldn't support them either I get along with everybody and have twenty or ...\nDo you envision though Ron Bergstrom if you were to beat Neal in this race and you're sitting there with Mary pat Flint and Ron Beatty\nWhat's that going to look like what that's what what's that going to sound like well let me let me go in\nTo the current situation now Leah says well he has some cost any problem she hasn't he hasn't done anything and that is the\nPrimary ring a meeting I say All right now during a public meeting I let me just hold your horses don't get no I'm not going to hold my house is because you're saying that I said that as a general statement I did say that he goes out and twittering ... tweets and he has a personal thing I Want the people who are in our meetings\nHe has never conducted themselves in a manner that I Would say it's been unprofessional during our\nMeetings or I if you'd let me see let me answer instead of instead of ranting while Iran I guess I'm not going to let you get away with saying ... I'm going to say what I Want to say and you can rent or you want the guy going out to bully me you can follow you are on hunger man I Know you've you've pointed that out a much bigger here's the deal\nI was referring specifically to run babies actions as a commissioner he has done nothing and leave it was right and because he has done nothing and because Mary pat has had health issues the county has been run by\nLeo ... which is why he uses the first person singular when he talks about like ... I have done this and I have done that\nIf I'm sitting in that seat I Am going to work with staff I'm going to work with a company that administrators and I'm going to work with the volunteers we have isn't going to be about me ... is maybe Iraq I think he's irrelevant as far as the county organization goes he lives right he doesn't say anything he doesn't do anything but he does this credit\n... county by his comments outside the building\nDo you think Ron ... Bergstrom that for people that pay attention to things that a commissioner Beatty has said that the race between you and Leo to some degree for some people no matter what the political affiliation his something of a referendum on Ron\n... unfortunately when I go out and I've had many little get togethers and people's houses and so on and we talk about ... county and sometimes they understand what the county doesn't sometimes they don't but if you mentioned Mr ... name or if somebody mentioned species name\nThey immediately perk up for the all the wrong reasons\nThey know and and they know who he is and I know his opinions and so you know the the ... the only good thing that's come of that is that the profile of Marshall County has been raised people are paying attention\nBut they're paying attention for the wrong reasons I Would just have shown run baby didn't exist as far as this race goes between me and ... that's the truth he he muddy the waters are this is a straight up race I'm a progressive guy and the Democrats Leo is a is a more conservative guys who Republican we've given our views on the issues I've supported things that he hasn't\nAnd that should be the decision that voters make in November\nAh we'll give you one last comment on this particular last statement\nHe just says a bunch of Milwaukee he's made run be an issue in this race between he and I since day one he did it in that in that letter to the editor and he's doing it here today too so it's it's it's baloney he he has\nMade this issue and he's hoping to win\nOn the fact that many people don't like Ron beat it I Do use the first word vernacular him I because I Am running for reelection\nAnd I want the people to know what I have brought to the table as their representative so yes I Do use it but I always pre face it in my component continues to leave it out that I Do not take the complete credit for everything I'm not patting myself in the back\nIt's the people that I helped put in place that's brought the county to the situation that we're in today and believe you me as a hell of a lot better than it was when I wasn't in office three and a half years ago\nYou're listening to news radio Ninety five W ... the county commissioners a race between ... and Ron Bergstrom were in the last portion of a this debate where the candidates get to ask each other at question it's your turn around Bergstrom your question for commissioner cocoon [noise]\nWell I'm a follow up on ... said about how he he is always given credit to people\nBut you know rumors rumors go around the or the county building and I have that from a couple of different sources that you once said that before you arrived the county was run by more runs to remember saying that can you say but I'll probably said that so you said that the county was run by more than before you left\nRun by not then that was an indication of the staff but certainly some people that were up there that day absolutely\nWell it's a good it's a good thing that we got rid of those more on\nJust as a damn good thing we got ... or the more honest because you know what when they were in charge not only did we not have\nA bond rating we didn't even come close to even being on the books for bond rating so it's not that we had a bad one\nWe didn't even have a bond rating that's like saying you don't have a credit card not that you have a low credit score you're gonna have a credit score so yes I'm Sorry and for people to say well we asked for it but we never got it and then sit back and do nothing but\nJust as much as violated so the last one was the question was whether you said it was right did more I I ... I don't remember it but I probably had a question for sounds like me [noise]\nOkay uh I could I ask I thought it's my turn ask him if it is but ah it's my show [laughter] [laughter] I I\nWas not aware that you called anyone a moron would you be willing to say whom you were calling him\nOn I don't think that's right at this point in time and to be really honest with you ... I don't really remember the statement I'm just not going to sit here and the guy that I ever said that I'm sure they ran arrested and charged and brought it up now let's clarify this Mr ... said in this question\nThat he heard from county ... county people so I'm sure it was something like walking around in a hallway or maybe in my office and yes I Do have an office or maybe you know in the parking lot I may have said that and I absolutely cannot deny that I did not\nSay All right the reason I brought that up it's basically goes to the attitude that Mr coon is headed toward his job he arrived on a white horse and save the bunch but hey arrive he denies that now he says oh I always give credit to step I Do it if you listen to what he says he arrived on his white horse and save the county from\nWe both wanted to straighten out if you will end right the ship find some kind of government this election is entirely different a vote for Ron be is going to be a vote for the way the county used to operate\nHe's clearly shown that he wants to go back to the old ways of balancing the budget he wants to go back to the old ways of tax and spending and he wants to go back to the old ways of being an apps and tea county commissioner\nI'm very proud to say that as your county commissioner for the last three and a half years I Do have an office in the courthouse I Do meet with people in that office privately and I had the uh and I do go there once a week and spend just about the whole day there\nBecause I Do not consider myself an ass and tea county commission and I have taken credit for it and even today use the term I because again I Do believe I have brought forth a lot of ideas and changes\nDownstairs in the hall Ron ... says to run Bergstrom said it's difficult for him to make changes as a one member of a Fifteen board that's ...\nWhen I was a one member of that Fifteen board I bought for things like investigating the case like compact which did in fact end up\nIn a divorce if you will kick by contacting county government something that we haven't talked about so I'm proud to stand here today and the ... have your listeners out there hopefully come back out and vote for six and support me again for four more years on my record\nIf you feel that I've done something that is wrong or hey you have somehow guided county government in the wrong direction than by all means vote for my opponent but if you believe that I've done a good job than please come out in front of a second and give me an opportunity\nTo spend four more years over ... [laughter] and I don't have a clock so I don't know if the Osama bin ... I'll probably go out on the second on Leo cocoon us as always thanks for you I appreciate it uh and now for his closing a run virtually run [noise]\nYes well I think we've given a pretty good idea to the listeners about the are conflicting views on on ... county but let me say this about the whole office into buildings and I think it's emblematic of a different attitude that I have from my opponent\nOr it's not about just having a physical efficient building no individual commissioner has any authority to direct employees I think that I think that's something the Mr coon is forgotten\nI'm no individual commissioner can set policy they work as a team [noise]\nSo having an office in the building I don't know what good that does except that you you're kind of looking over the shoulder of the county employees and also Mr Beatty has an office in the building if he were to wander over to Mr ... office they couldn't even talk to each other out in the sense that would be that no it's not the same building I sit in on the complex\nSo that so that that what what purpose it serves but it does for one purpose it shows that\nThey believe that the hard work being county commissioners inside the complex it's inside the building I Believe the work of the county commission is just outside the building I believed outreach to our town so I Believe it's outreach to our community I Believe it's going out and asking what can we do for you what services do you value how can the Kennedy help you\nTo face the challenges that we face in in the future it's not sitting in an office in with your nose into books we have people who will pay to do that\nAll right I you're right I bring something to the table I think is sorely lacking and and and also hosts will sorely lacking in a lot of elected officials and ... I Know a lot around for Twenty years I've served and a lot of positions but I also know what I don't know and I rely on the people who we hire\nAnd the people who we empower did she tell me the direction we should take I buy give the direction but they should tell me how to get there so I think there's going to be a serious difference as to who is going to be um who is going to be the next county commissioner as of January first thank you\nThank you Ron Bergstrom appreciate it we could his best of luck to both of you don't forget everybody election day is November ah the sex\nMy producer is got a smile on his face because he needs to take this break\nAnd we'll take this break and come back and he'll be coming back against no you you and we are done that was done news radio Ninety five WXXI gay and Jean my producer will be put in this up on the podcast\nI'm In a few hours so or you can go back and listen to this if you want thanks everybody's paying fellas and now I go back to my my most of my\nMy critic and most important critical ... my wife is she going to tell me don't get emotional\nWhy tasting season is here again [noise] Hi this is Don Korea blanche is winding spirits in Hyannis\nChemical engines we're expanding our weekly wine tastings to benefit your schedule friday's from five to eight and Saturdays from two to five splinters will have a selection of whites from our current newsletter being tasted this is a great opportunity to try something new than talk line with us\nBlanchard is located up one sixty seven corporation street Hyannis great times being given Blanchard is Dan Dan with your ... shake my head and say you know what is happening to our country use radio Ninety five W.
