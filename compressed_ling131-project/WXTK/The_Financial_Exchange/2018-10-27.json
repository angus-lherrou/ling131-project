[noise]\nFollow these practical test\nGood morning and welcome back to garden line this is the first than I'm In for Seattle this morning\nI Hope you're all warm and snug and dry [noise] we're going to go straight to Bob whose entire which ... the Bob\n... grew from there\nI Would say yes I'm don't go to severely or we are getting close to that winter season but they're both really these are well established plants I'm guessing you're okay\nThen they're pretty tough plants and you're not going to force any new growth of those too so I think that that would be fine to go ahead and I'm from the back somewhat I wouldn't you know I wouldn't do a severe pruning on the prevent until spring which then you can go as low as you need to but if you were just looking to give that a hedge Trump go for it\nRight or You're welcome good luck I next week supposed to be good weather for gardening so it should be the perfect time to do it [laughter]\nOkay You're welcome to take care yeah there's some of those garden tests that while the weather is good next week let's take advantage of it and now we're going to talk to join in the morning joy Hi\nGood job and very good yeah\nThank you [laughter]\nI have a Bush\nAnd I think is a\nCap or Cheney and I moved here last year and it was growing fine but\nSome animals are digging in to the root mhm and I don't know what kind of my ... moms that might be where I don't know but\nI keep sticking branches of I'm Holly in their thinking that will be perfectly and they won't go but then they just take another whole\nYeah um that's a tricky one um [noise] I'm trying to think ...\nYou know my mother in law used to use mosque malls around the shrubs which kept the critters away but I'm not sure if that's considered kosher anymore because the ... sort of a toxic [laughter] toxic chemical them trying to think [noise] um there's not a whole lot you could you could\nLike chicken wire just on the ground and use soil staples to just keep it in flat that might discourage them from you know digging at the base there\nI couldn't be my guess is it could be squirrels chipmunks it could even be skunks 'em and they're just probably if squirrels they might be burying acorns you know if it's skunks they might be smelling grubs are looking for something like that\nI was afraid that they'd be eating that route well the problem\nIs they might be damaging the roots that's where I Would be concerned is that if they're digging enough they could damage there is potentially but if you just got a small amount of chicken wire\nWhich is not that expensive and cut some pieces to lay it around the base and then are you familiar with soil staples usually we yeah I'm ... great they they're like a U shaped nail this long and I would just stick it into the ground to hold that chicken wire in place\nAnd it's not going to be much fun for them to dig with that wire in place so that should discouraged them I'm your Holly sounds like it was a good\nPlan that probably just pulling it out is but it's written or they just got another all yeah [laughter] I just want to run a you\nKnow little rascals there you know I mean it is true and I've seen you know they will sometimes if it if it is some something like vocals they could end up eating roots too so I'm I feel the ... back into the soil and then I put that chicken wire down and see if that does the trick\nOkay I'll Try that thank you You're welcome and good luck with that thank you thank you\nBye bye it is a little bit tricky I'm trying to keep criticize out of our guard and sometimes I Believe\nWe have one more call coming in is probably the last call we can get today\nAnd it's\nMy firm ... meals we are going to take that call morning um oh this is in how are you\nA good good um so I think a big big or drink or that we want oh okay good good time to do that\nI I Would probably on a high drainage I'd probably wait till spring um and then I Would do it before they get their leaves so early spring\nIn order for you know struck\nA well then that's a different story right [laughter] you have to do them now so it's not the best time but I Would say go ahead and do it\nUm they're going to lose their leaves are they frosted at all yeah I'm here in ... of course there for us it a little bit [laughter] that's where I live in a are always get for us since we were among the first to get for us [noise]\nUm so it's actually maybe not a bad thing if they're losing their leaves at this stage of the game wherever you are going to put them the biggest thing is to really amend the soil they really need good rich soil and this is your big opportunity to do it so adding peat moss common or things like that\nPut that into the soil they're not that deep rooted but get as much of a root system as you can you won't have to worry about the soil being wet because it will be so I Would have normally tell you to make sure the ... before you do it it will be [laughter] um do it as soon as you can of course\nAnd then if they're really tall are they really big ones tall\nUh they're pretty\nOkay so what I Would probably do is try and I'm just to keep the wind away maybe trim them down a little bit normally I wouldn't necessarily do you know what kind they are\nOne below okay okay well\nI wouldn't normally recommend a big pruning and hide ranges at this time of year but go ahead and trim them a little bit just because you're going to be disturbing that root system might cost you a few flowers in the spring but it'll be worth it to save the plant and then if it needs to even steak it because\nThe kind of when we've been having and the kind of ... will be getting all winter sometimes normally you don't need to stake high drain just but because you're transplanting now until the roots get reestablish\nI Would say go ahead and take it a little just so it doesn't move around too much in the wind and keep loosening the root systems for the winter and then make sure it stays water I mean I I don't think we're going to have a problem with that but in case we do have a dry spell\nFor instance if it doesn't rain all next week maybe you want to give it water just once or twice to just make sure it doesn't try out until the stats are who's back\nAlright I record very quickly because one of them knew maple trees on the property okay [noise]\nWell you could take a chance and doing it now they're already on sale so that's an advantage um again you'd want to water that in well to make sure it's watered in to be to get an established you could take a chance now otherwise do your best\nBet is in the spring say in a late march April [noise] that would be your best the best time if this was a month earlier that would have been better in October I Would have been great but it's we're almost to the answer to it real soon if you're going to do it this year\nBanks of heart or your welcome you to and thanks to all of you out there have a happy Halloween this is the end for us I've been filling in for ... this morning and she will be back with you next week on certain line W X ray [noise]\n\n\n\n\nBring out and we break and when you watch the game West Germany great God and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five ...\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News I Wonder what they are off we are finding out more about the mail bomb suspect arrested in Florida\nDow Jones falling then now I'm afraid we are below the profit line for the year I'm we're up about seven or eight percent and now we\nAre down Thirteen one on the top ... percent or the year on the Dow Jones stuff with the highest but we are off ten\nPercent uh since the September ... from the U.S all fall so that's the part of hundred stopped yes\nThat down a three point nine percent almost ... percent of the week and\nThey're all for half a percent now for the year so everybody is off except the NASDAQ stocks are they're the ones that have uh the alphabet and the\nFacebook and Google and\nAmazon and they are still up slightly three percent for the year but they were off almost Thirteen percent so we are seeing\nOf calmed down and um\nAnd especially watching the a spoiler cap stops there in the index called\nThe Russell two thousand and blow up in the ... and they are off almost a four percent for the week and now they're in like the territory so are these are the ones that are being affected by the tariffs and supplies and then we'll talk about that in a minute but of course there's\nNever been a good market has never had a good reputation in the market\nCrash of Nineteen twenty nine came in October and the surprise um of Nineteen eighty seven game in October we were off Twenty one percent there and the Dow Jones ... percent here for the week we went off Twenty one percent in one day\nI Know so we can remember that in two thousand eight October was horrible mhm ah so it's got a bad reputation\nIn the markets September not so good to Mark Twain said October it was one of the deadliest and worst months to invest except for all the other weapons so I guess we'll have to follow along with him [noise]\nWhy or why this all came is is your question and everybody else's question\nUm take your choice uh-huh nothing different tariffs have been a working with us for months now they are raising the cost down in American companies and being mentioned\nNow because this is the earnings are we ... that come out for the companies' earnings\nAre that are in the third\nQuarter up to September thirtieth yeah so we're starting\nTo get mentions that uh the tariffs which are supplying especially to the small company supplying\n'em a basis for manufacturing there are now have a ten percent tariff on them and that's soon to go up to twenty five percent by the end of October if we keep in these\nTerrible wars or skirmishes or whatever\nYou want to call them um but in any case that doesn't seem to be back down on this between China and\nOurselves so I'm really looking that either they're going to pass them on\nTo a buyer's which means things are going to cost you more the consumer or are they going to have to uh\nNot pass them on and shrink their margins in the prophet area so that has not been a good result for the CEOs talking about what's coming up through the end of\nThe year that's but that's got people worried um but it is a manmade situation or it could change\nOn the horizon yet but\nIt's so it's possible when she had a Trump in November\nThe cheap money\nThe industrial see demand slowing a that's another thing the international Monetary Fund these global growth slowing down and\nThe China market is down over twenty percent year China is one of the key drivers of the world economy they tried to rally on friday um [noise]\nUm but no such luck a\nSo we've got a problem there with China and the market in China driving other uh market's down we got the U.S housing market as you know hit a wall\nLast week a new house he was all for about five percent a\nWhich is unusual for such a high percentage\nAt or below the demand for houses are still a rising costs a is\nAlso going up in a building because the materials costs going up\nWell there was a positive housing report that came out by the national association of realtors um they just issued to first positive pending home sales report in months and\nYeah the the demand is there yeah demand is there\nYes and so I'm depending sales is which is a ... a leading indicator for existing home sales did a rise slightly in a month\nOr which saw a declining sales of existing homes and have ... fairly devastating report on sales of newly constructed ones but there is there's a positive influence out there I mean as we both know homeownership is still\nReally that the path to a sign of a good economy and um the lack of neighboring tore\nOf moderately priced homes and falling affordability as factors are are really restraining the housing market but it looks like um [noise] it's still showing housing climate as favorable\n... the the housing you're correct it and that and and some people use the term punching above its weight mhm\nUm and that is a the if you're buying a house you also buying a refrigerator and you're buying a lawn Moran you buying\nCarpets and you're buying buying things that have to get to get edited and as you move out of your one room apartment and now finally it was your dream up there on the ...\nWhen when you're talking about pending home sales that index it's a measure of newly signed contracts at for existing home purchases and in that rose I I Know it's it seems insignificant put zero point five percent um so we the index has increased you\nKnow the trend is your friend yeah so uh we'll watch it I think the thing which may have influenced\nThe and up our realtor or listeners will love verify or let us know about this is the fact that sellers have begun to see that they no longer can get the price that they were asked to be the one that was a seller's market\nWell marketing indeed cooling I had an initial link it started and link it started in if you're if you're a tied in to any of the ah\nElectronic transmitters that tell you when a house is lifted for sale if you're watching a house you're getting a messages that say ... ... the market in general\nUh either in the stock market the housing market um bond market\nIs being re priced taking a new look because we're always looking ahead to the\nFuture markets are always look ahead to the future so what we've got is a fact that the beginning to see\nA a slowing growth\nNow we've had some pretty spectacular growth this year or the third quarter and even the fourth quarter ought to come in pretty well off but gaining above twenty percent we look ahead towards a two thousand twenty and they're the\nGrowth will stop but it does to me that the growth is\nGoing to a decline to a point where we're going to be back in the slump that we were back in two thousand eleven two thousand twelve\nMarket has moved ahead the economy has moved ahead it may slow down in a bit of momentum but it's not returning to anything near a recession that we can see at this point\nWhen we compare it to let's say the year two thousand when the housing market was considered very healthy\nAnd home sales figures roughly equivalent to what what they are now Steve Ford ability condition to a much lower compared to now so even though affordability has been falling recently that demand for housing should remain steady don't you agree\nWell I think I think the the demand will be there will have to your point does to the fact\nThat maybe this is what we should discuss now because of the real factor behind this decline is the\nA rate rise and the Federal Reserve rates and this was the thing that that has kicked off the downturn in the market we we can talk about other things for China and it's only [noise] oh the mid term elections all these things\nMore psychological than actual but you know the demand is there and\nIf we can reprise homes to meet the ... the man [noise] then we're going to see a turnaround [noise]\nWell the the economy is is truly thriving at this juncture I think and but it it it just has yet to have a substantial impact on the real estate market\nUm consolidating a home equity line of credit right now\nOr simply dropping private mortgage insurance if you had to have private mortgage insurance when you purchase your house now is the time because they're going to use\nThe cops within the last three months which are highest and best right now if you wait for December you're going to be using\nSeptember August September and October if you wait till January you're going to be using December November an October probably probably less than what the previous three months were so you see what we're I'm going with this ad in the new\nYear as the as the trend of changes you gonna get the different\nA comparison but going to work pretty much in your favor\nVery much so and what what we're looking at is we're looking at a point to five percent\nRise by the feds this last go around so you're looking at higher credit card interest rates you're looking at higher home equity line of credit interest rates if you're buying a new car those are going to be higher\nSo if you're thinking about consolidating credit card balances you know credit cards can go anywhere from Eighteen percent to have seen them as high as thirty two percent if you miss a payment they they increase that interest rate\nIf you're making your monthly payments you're never seeing that balance go down so this is a real good opportunity to really\nPut the prospective have someone someone good lender look at your financial assets and liabilities and say here's how you can save yourself some money and a good lender will allow you to do that and if you don't have a good lender\nI encourage you to give me a call five zero eight two six four four eight zero five I'm not your average lender\nOr if you call me on a Saturday or Sunday don't be surprised when I answered the telephone I Will answer that telephone and don't be surprised if you say well I'm In town today can you meet me and I say sure I'll meet you over my office and\nAn hour that happens and typically\nIf you're shopping on the weekends sometimes it's hard to get in touch with your lender so just to understand I I had a tremendous closing month I I was very busy diligently\nAttending closings yesterday and just want to give a shout out to a couple of people Mike I'm Patty who purchased a their home in sandwich Michelle who closed on her loan and Boston Bob and Donna Centerville Dan self Hamilton that was a quick one I think we did Dan's alone and three weeks\nChatting Betsy over in Martha's Vineyard they are moved in now to their home on Martha's Vineyard Matt ... males ... and Matt\nPurchase their first home in Brewster congratulations to both of you John in mash pie Sarah and Marshfield Jamy Ian Dennis port we did a a seasonal condo purchase it's a second home for them\nWe were able to do that and um I don't think a lot of other lenders could do that seasonal condominium and Sergei in Centerville so\nIt it's not the end of the month yet we try to sketches was tired of the thirty first so that's not ultra chaos and the registry of deeds but uh we certainly have had a good month and congratulations to all those people who walked in at tremendous rates and uh and now have\nA home of their own whether it's a first home or whether it's a second home or it's a a vacation home congratulations to all those people so it's it has been an incredibly busy month at\nWell they um I congratulate them as well for stepping up at a time when things\nAre a little discombobulated in office and you have to admire people that are the ... when the market is down or a little bit of a lot of controversy as to when I have is um but it does take go\nTo those two are some uh counters um but\nIf you figure when uh [noise] if you go to places when things are on sale the\nProvider good but right now will be a stop from Phil so\nThe question is for people who are booked up the papers or a bus or Saturday when they took over their portfolio of Selma got up and um it's also an opportunity\nTo work in the market and we did have a question you know um we ask for a questions or comments mhm oh on the on the market of this question that the people on an asteroid\nBombs or oh we\nTried to reply I'm the website or is or the or email us an email those\nQuestions to Wall Street week Wall Street walk for Wall Street\nWalk a at AOL dot com\nA way a Wall Street walk one word an AOL dot com and will will will reply to the other ... um we will uh\nBe able to uh to clear up some of the mysteries that the people feel better just to judge will investors in the walk through this one we have this week was about the ...\nThe ... is a symbol or it's being talked about on the shows are being mentioned is a new indicator in the market all the VIX is actually the ah the market symbol\nFor [noise] of the Chicago Board options exchange it measures um how many people are selling\nA what options are the is the betting that the market will go down excuse me buying put options that means that you're hoping that the market will go down\nAnd how many people are buying coal market's hoping that the market will go up\nBy the stock price and so it wouldn't get higher so it's a it's\nWhich is too much in the weeds and uh but [noise] when the uh the ratio\nThose are normally flap around the corner thirties index and that's mentioned are on the radio recently the low last year or through the beginning of this year was about nine to ten which means that there is a fairly\nBalance between the buyers and sellers and people were pretty much in balance if it goes down to nine they're optimistic that by more calls like you walk is going to go up\nBut the ratio this week uh was hot air and reach just under twenty five and that showed\nThat people were very pessimistic about the market of course when the market goes down people are going to get her a pessimistic but the VIX index is sometimes called fear and\nAnd um when it gets particularly high in back in February when we had the same decline we have now\nIt when I was five fifty so with that signals to the market buys anything between thirty fifty will be a strong ... that means that people have just gone too far into the theater\nAnd there's two things you can count on in the market if the market goes down and uh the VIX gets very hot it's fear and it's a motion all rather than Russia to quit or a ...\nSaid no okay if the market hates on certain\nOr could always have uncertainty but well fear and we had that fear when the market went down ... points on the ones that it was just an emotional\nSoul and so it rebounded back mhm but ah\nAlso if the market goes down and the VIX goes down as well it means that the selling has probably dried up and the\nPeople using options are able to a swing around and to the ... side and we saw a little of that this week it was a hint that the market maybe through filling but then it kind of reversed itself and held up around twenty five level it's a little too\nDetailed but it was a good question and you're going to see this word ... talked about and if it's going up that's an indication that people are getting very fearful wouldn't want to be taught to enter the market just as your people elected the housing market now or the mortgage rate which is\nProbably going to be a half a point below what is going to be one at sprint\nI agree wholeheartedly there and I mean right now we're looking at a thirty year fixed depending upon credit score I mean if you have a seven forty or better credit score and you have twenty to twenty five percent put down you're really in the range of a four point eight to five percent range on a purchase\nAnd so it's still a great time and you're seeing that slight cooling of pricing out there for home so those folks who are looking at Holmes is typical that\nAnd you don't want to spend your own money purchase renovation program would be the answer\nIf your first time buyer and you're paying rent and you think my credit scores and good enough for me to buy a home\nPlease call glad that five zero eight two six four four eight zero five we have a credit simulator\nSometimes it works instantly sometimes we have to do a little work and sometimes we have to put a plan in place but having a plan and working towards that goal is better than just sitting there dreaming about homeownership someday so there are a lot of great things that we're going to talk about when we come back from the break\nYou're listening to the Cape cod real estate show and we'll be back with more after\nThis message\nThis report is brought to you by indeed done Tom DeLay right now on the ... or the board bridge heading on or off Cape roots exceeds just traveling well through Hyannis Barnes ... and ... and we have no problems along the canal roads I'm Jackie

trends offered by any manufacturer in any vehicle right now from Rio de has one of the ... of the entire presumed when we've ever had and our team of silk professionals\nWould love to show how truly affordable and economical and new Prius can be\nTo come by and she would just do my own house ... bridge ... to ... you can watch DJ\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen you're listening to the Cape cod real estate shell that music was courtesy of Eric our producer in the studio box and thank you Eric what do you dressing up for Halloween this year uh\nI'm not sure yet some friends oh my goodness well you'll have to let you know we'll have to let me know okay so we're talking\nAbout a couple of things we're talking about two thousand Eighteen we're talking about a very different market that we have experienced month after month after month and now we're in a cooling phase not surprised by the cooling phase because of the time of the year\nBut a really indicators out there are suggesting if you are still out there looking for a home keep looking capitalize on the opportunity for a market values dropping slightly\nEven though the rates have picked up a little bit is that a ... a slight decline in value will offset that slight increase in interest rate sooner than later or if you're thinking about\nConsolidating debt or taking equity out of your home for a future need and I'm Talking look at a five year plan people\nAh don't wait for five years when the rates are up one percent or more I look at it now do your due diligence and look at it now and get your financial house in order\nAs I indicated if you're just tuning into the show now I indicated if you are refinancing right now in taking some of that equity out of your house to either put in a higher yields savings accounts\nOr a a planned down the road or the lake consolidating some jak getting rid of high interest rate credit cards do it now the appraisers going to go out they're going to use ... based on the last three months\nHighest highest of values out there in a long long time so you you can capitalize on that moment to\nIf you're going to think about refinancing in March you're probably looking at sales that have happened in December January and February there was going to be much lower than what we're looking at in July August and September\nSo again do your due diligence we come on this show each week\nTo give you insight and to give you a look\nYou don't necessarily have to use our plan but some of the suggestions that we make our because we've been doing this for a long time and we're just trying to help you as the consumer who doesn't watch the market on a day to day basis like we do\nSo we talked about the focus uh this past these these past uh\nEight months nine months ten months and the focus was getting your highest and best offer prepared having a strong pre approval letter I'm\nUsing an escalation clause because if you're going to go in with a high price or you're going to go in and asking price\nAnd you know that someone else's behind you making an offer using an escalation clause is clearly\nA great idea if you really want that house and if you're going to go in with less than a full price offer why not add the escalation clause if someone comes in behind you and you really want that house again escalation costs for those of you\nWho haven't heard of them or haven't used one it allows the buyer to make their offer\nAn atom escalation clause which indicates they're willing to pay a thousand dollars more than the highest offer received\nAnd you want to make sure that that's a verifiable offer because anybody can say oh we just received a million dollar offer you don't want to be in that boat\nBut certainly a verifiable offer and you can put a cap on it as well so you can say well a thousand dollars over the highest offer up to X. so there's a one idea if you're out there shopping today\nAnd you find that there's one or two people behind you so one of the things that I Want to mention short sales and foreclosures yes they are still out there this is a time\nOf year when the lenders really start to look at their short sale in foreclosure lists and they really want to get ready to clean their slates so they're getting ready to clean their sleep in two thousand Eighteen\nAnd so if you are negotiating this is a great time to to really nickel go shape you have slightly lower values now in the pot whereas if you made that offer the beginning of the year values are much higher\nSo I'm really make sure that uh your legal expert or realtor is I'm keeping their finger on the pulse of that transaction for you because again if you had\nAn appraisal that was done three months ago and we're going to have to redo that again you know a hundred and twenty days later you might see a slight difference in value so\nIf you're in Boston a transaction that requires\nA ... or ... negotiating a value\nThis might be a time to revisit that\nIn terms of what we're seeing out there are lots of people still have their homes listed for sale and they're still out shopping for home\nMore than likely if you are finding a home and you are thinking about making an offer contingent upon the sale of your house the likelihood of that being accepted is probably slim to now remember\nSam five has the bridge line of credit the line of credit that's used to bridge that gap between listing and selling your home how does it work\nWe take the value of that property and we can use one or the other we can use to values we can use the assessed value\nOf the tax a bill that you have and if that's not sufficient enough then we'll have an appraisal done and will use the appraisal it'll cost you about four hundred and fifty dollars to do that whereas if we use the assessed value costs is hero but we can actually\nAllow you access to the equity in your home to to use as a down payment on the other home so in terms of what we've looked at we've got a Fifteen Percent down mortgage for a primary purchase up to two\nMillion dollars with no private mortgage insurance and we offer that in the thirty year fixed rate or seven or ten year adjustable really great rates if your first time by our we have a hundred percent financing through mass housing [noise]\nBasically in a nutshell sailing five has at all and I'm here to help you ... your host your mortgage doctor your lender if you need assistance this weekend five zero eight two six for for a zero five I'm happy to help and give us a call have a great weekend Cape Cod

they can't leave it alone that it they obviously have every break they have ads\nBut the end they can't shut up all of the one that got me this morning when I flipped it on to find out what happened is uh they used to announce as one of them\nIs that Laden character and I tell you that they can't shut up during the game they can't just let you watch the game I Know it's from a keg\nWhining but somebody's got to say it now they this guy says\nI Know how we've got to get this team motivated to sit\nThere in the world series you met with\nMaking hundreds of thousands of dollars being experts and and this goes from Raleigh announce [noise] just about all of them\nEvery player is a superstar but if you can't be motivated when you're playing in the world series without the announces or anyone else telling you how to be motivated\nOr you need counseling but that's what it is and so that's it's just a it's just incredible but it's fun to watch and it's just too bad it's that late that they play so we got lots to talk\nAbout here because we got the bomb scares which the meteor it costs just doing their very best to use against\nA Trump and against you and I voting for Republicans\nAh because we're evil and of course it was Donald Trump that caused a the attitudes to be that this man [noise] would be a certainly associated with Trump and its Trump's fault and unfortunately uh probably\nSixty percent of the state believes and that's\nWho to vote for by the way I went out and voted this week it was great um\nWho's busy but it's much better than standing in line and go I wanted to say Hi to the gals that my word I've known them for forty years down at town hall still there\nAnd I was standing in line and a fellow in front of me turns and look for new voting on was Paul Kirk one of the finest guys that are we ever had a for a brief time as senator when a Senator Kennedy my friend when he was ill\nAh and before his term would run out Paul substituted for him\nWould they express a condition that he would not run again which to me was our huge loss he's one of the most honest most capable\nKnowledgeable people and it's a shame that we couldn't have had him he's a Democrat as I was\nBut he's very fair and honest his dad was a judge Kirk on the east Massachusetts Supreme Court he's been a lawyer and he would have been a great center we need more people but again they don't\nRun but anyway we had a nice chat and I just wanted to say hello\nTo uh uh those wonderful gals that that did a wonderful job and as I say it was busy or\nMake sure your wall vote by the way or the other thing a brief er into as I used to own as many of you do the ...\nUh my first business venture out of education was the ... uh my son's meals cash market which has been there since Eighteen\nEighty four and a lady that worked there before I owned it became a dear friend 'cause she lived across the street with her husband side we call them\nHer

wonderful wonderful lady walked across the street just about every\nDay and she worked as I said at the cash market and many of you there I I Know I hear from a lot of my sons meals people but she worked there for sixteen years and uh she and her husband were involved in the ... county fair for over Thirty years\nAnd ah the house of representatives honored her in Nineteen twenty fourteen is the
