President Trump is making immigration a key mid term election issue\nA lot of money spent passing to people\nBut our interest rates three point eight Seventy five percent tough to let go of that you go get one now you're looking at five so I mean I don't I don't know how I justify that and now in all likelihood I don't see a situation where I Am very likely to look at a new home anytime soon\nInstead of this is the situation that I think the fed finds itself in as you're seeing signs of the housing market is slowing in in the housing market is a major engine for growth both in terms of what people were able to borrow in order to hate generate spending that way\nBut also the the economic activity crates as far as jobs for plumbers carpenters electric age ... you name it you run down the list and so I think the fed is between a rock and a hard place because there is inflation coming because\nThe labor market is so tight right now and that's not going away anytime soon I don't think\nAt the same time you have a slowing economy as as these numbers indicate on this that I think is going to become an issue at some point next year the fed can't have both they can't say hey we're going to chop inflation and we're going to have a strong housing market you can't have both at this point I think that's what this data is telling me\nThey're going to have to pick what is more important to them\nKeeping inflation in check for keeping the economy moving\nIn the if you go back to the Paul Volcker days Paul Volcker raised rates through the roof because he said it's more important to keep inflation in check and keep the dollar strong\nThey keep the economy moving in the short term\nI don't know where Jay Powell is going to land on yeah but he's going to face it it's not going to be the magnitude of what Volcker faced but it's a similar decision and historical precedent says that Volcker was the outlier because every other time we've seen this\nMost of the fed chairs typically say yeah let's keep things moving and try to keep the economy ... that's what we've typically seen so that's where I come up with my thought hey we're probably seeing one ... next year not the three they're guiding towards\nThis data point is kind of the first one that really suggest hey there's there's really something that's going on here that the ... going to have to\nPay attention to the data point that I think could easily offset that say if you said okay we do have a declining housing market but we got some retail sales at the end of this year that just knocked the roof off that could go that could change things for the fact that can really push them towards raising interest rates again and that two to three hikes next year rather than just one\nTo talk about what's going on in China they reported their second quarter or a third quarter GDP I'm Sorry a and it came in at six point five percent year over year which begs the question what the heck is the real GDP their cars six point five certainly isn't what's actually going on\nYeah I always tend to discount whenever whenever the Chinese government puts out bad economic data you always got discounted a little bit\nBut six point five percent for China's not very good anyway that's the worst GDP Growth number that they've seen since the first quarter of two thousand nine and a anyone falling at home you remember what the economy was like back in first quarter of two thousand and not [noise]\nYeah wasn't particularly strong no wasn't particularly good so ... ... ... again it raises the question hey if if they're telling you it's six point five percent and slowing how slow is it actually is a three and a half to four and a half I have no idea but\nWe know from you know just kind of what we've seen in divergence is before a numbers between what China tells you and then what their electricity consumption isn't their gas consumption we know it's not usually what they're telling you it's just a question of how far off it is\nUm but either way you look at this China is going through a period of slowing and I think you can\nDraw a pretty direct line there between what we're seeing from a trade perspective and the slowing growth that's going on\nYeah I mean if you want to take the pessimistic view sure you can say the second largest world economy is slowing down but if you're an American you want to be optimistic view it appears that you know our trade tariffs are having a good impact it appears that we are intentionally trying to and succeeding and slowing down the Chinese economy\nSo this is going to be something that does bear watching you know we're ... it's gonna be interesting to see if this continues into the fourth quarter there but China coming in again with its slowest GDP Growth number since two thousand nine\nObviously an economy like that can't grow seven eight percent a year for ever but still it suggests that things are not uh not all rosy in China at the moment is here but let's talk tipping because this is a it is is just a phenomenal\nTopic to get into so that you two have been into you've gotten into whether it's you know bakeries coffee shop\nWherever it may be that there's a lot of these new point of sale terminals maybe they're run by square pay ... a ... there's a whole bunch of matter there where it's pretty much an eye pad and then the cashier enters in what you're going to pay and then they flip it over to see you can just signing your car signing name and swipe and everything but when they flip it over and show it to you\nEven though you're just maybe picking up a coffee or maybe there's still a spot not a spot but the first prompt his hey how much tip do you want to give life in a lot of people\nAre finding themselves in the awkward situation of saying well gee I don't want to tip you anything just 'cause all you're doing is handing me something across the counter why am I tipping you for that what's what is going on here\nYeah or maybe in some circumstances you pay three fifty for something and you know leave the back in the day you would say okay or the fifty cents and chair in jail put that in the tip jar right\nUm these are prompting much larger tests you know the general what you're seeing out there is if you're purchasing an item for less than ten dollars the options are one two or three dollars and if it's over ten that I think it's Fifteen\nNo Eighteen twenty or twenty five per cent tip levels as the default\nNow that the ... can be changed by the individual uh owner okay so they say okay we want to change the default there\nBut a lot of them aren't necessarily doing that and so I guess both are individuals who are buying stuff as well as cashiers are saying man this is really awkward you know cast your flip it over and you know you bought it for you know two dollar muffin or something like that and is asking you if you want to give a two dollar tip right and you're sitting there and you're like\nLook I really liked the cashier man but\nI'm not tipping you a hundred percent on that it's not like it's good but it's not that good and you're nice but you're not that nice and by the way it will smelly so hey let's let's get this cleaned up around here that OK well here's a practical example\nIt I'm gonna throw out that has driven me crazy there is a brewery that shall remain nameless that I that I frequent and go pick up\nI'll do I go buy a bunch of cans there because they don't sell them in liquor stores and to you know you have to go to the brewery to get them\nGo in there you might buy ... there have been occasions where I bought two hundred dollars worth of cans of beer and then you go to sign it and there's a you know default twenty per cent tip level for somebody who just carried a case of beer over to the counter and gave it to me ... I've never tip to the guy the liquor store\nOr but I just don't understand why this prompt is coming up a yeah it's bothering me when\nI'm going to go in a little different direction or while I Do think that there is added pressure when they do flip that I've had over to you\nYou can just as easily just said no tip and I don't have any problem that I frequently do that I'm not a big a temper when I'm going to a coffee shop or anything to big tip that I give is when I go out to eat and sit down and have a meal that's what I really give a good tip 'em I feel more awkward when I put my leftover changing the jar\n'cause I'm really oh yeah I feel way more awkward doing that because who the hell wants you to count all the change at the end of the day at the end of your shit got rolled nine to me that way yeah exactly but I feel awkward making them do that to add a task\nYou know to make more work for them just to counter tip money and I just feel more awkward putting changing the jar as opposed to a dollar would say\nThis does take us over to our poll question of the day up on right now on financial exchange show dot com they feel more pressure to tip on eye pad cash registers\nAgain head over to financial exchange show dot com and vote you can also Texas at six three five six six if you want to give us your opinion and whether or not you'll like these uh you know the new cash registers that are based on I ... that you know they're just flip it over and say how much do you want to tip\nLet us know what your thoughts are on that and whether or not you like him hate him or hey just doesn't move the needle much for him we're going to take a break when we come back we're gonna talk more about the story a involving or the missing Washington Post journalist who is suspected to have been killed\nA and exactly what the Trump Administration is doing in response right after this break on the financial exchange your hopes\nBreaking financial news to financial exchange with very Armstrong and Chuck's on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique products and cash management services to help you collect rent managed condo association payments and\nDigitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

years ago now\nUm so the volume of payment that they process in the third quarter roast Seventy eight percent year over year just Seventeen billion dollars still only a little bit more than ten percent of pay pal hundred and forty three billion total volume for the quarter\nBut the big thing that they're starting to see is that more people are participating not just in the free transfers that you do to get money to a friend\nBut what they call monetize herbal action twenty four percent of bend mobile users are participating in that type of transaction now that's up from Seventeen percent in the second quarter and only Thirteen percent in May of this year so almost doubling in a span of six months\nYeah and I I was always kind of curious when I first started using the sap exactly what Ben Miller was doing to make money and this appears to be there because they don't offer ads they're not trying to sell you on here which is not yet at least nice and refreshing yeah not not yet\nBut where they are monetize ing it seems to be on consumer to business and business to business transactions where your linking a credit card to your account\nAnd say you're ordering a meal for delivery and you use your bend mo to complete that transaction they're keeping a three percent transaction fee on that\nSo they're keeping that above and beyond what the credit card process\nHad ... he's so yeah er which seems like it would be pretty pretty substantial amount and you'd be paying ... percent total then when you factor in credit card fees yeah so perhaps they have some sort of deal worked out with the credit cards to you know less than that a little bit but a\nPretty substantial uh but you know in the same thing happens with pay pal pay pal I think you pay two point nine percent on those same transactions so yeah I'm a ... really where the opportunity lives for them is they're starting to get integrated with you know companies so\nWhen you log in to grab a hub or eat you can log your Menlo information right in there and you can just seamlessly you know not not entering the credit card information just boom ... real quick logging to bend mow and complete the

to this point\nSo far still pretty early here but fifty six point two percent of our listeners say no they do not feel more pressure when tipping on the I've had a cash registers and we also have a couple checks coming in or one out of the five away or no pressure at all I ... know tip every time with al ...\nA year where you're not a waiter or waitress you don't serve me you don't get tips and then a out of the nine seven eight hey guys spot on what the tipping I refused to tip for take out\nSo that's the next push that I was going to do you get a tip on taking no\nNever I Do I Do I must have a large order so to when I it depends on the type of take out but if I'm buying something where they need to individually package a bunch of stuff that they would otherwise need to just serve on my plate I figure they're putting in at least as much work to some degree as a disturbing it so I tend to tip a few bucks when I'm doing take out if\nSomething like sushi where they've got you know kind of a complicated order to conduct late and separate if I'm buying a box of pizza that's a different story\nI typically on on takeout I'll still tip ten percent just 'cause a lot of times uh workers do share tips that pool tips a lot of restaurants fail and so on something that's takeout from what would normally be a sit down restaurant I'll still tip ten percent just because hey I'm I'm not getting the same service that I was outwardly\nIf I were sitting down there but all the back and work is still being done so I Do still tip ten percent on take out orders\nThough obviously I'm not tipping you're twenty twenty five and\nBurn up berries brigade log on to financial exchange does come and sign up today\nHoover as they prepare for their ideals now it sounds like it's going to be in the first half of next year they had that lovely um [noise]\nArticle in the wall Street Journal about how they're targeting a hundred and twenty billion dollar evaluation earlier this week which I think it was just\nPure messaging on the behalf of the banks that are working for them if they are now apparently testing a quote on demand a labor service uh in order to provide\nEmployees are temp employees pretty much for whether it's you know one off event like weddings and things like that maybe it's you need someone to come in for a couple of weeks to do data entry but they're trying to get into this business which leads me to the question why on earth do they think they're going to be good at this\nI actually am going to disagree with you here I I think that they\nHave the potential to be able to pull this off um you know they're already pretty good at dictating specific terms to a non I go to a contractors um they've got a pretty big network of people that could potentially bring into this\nUm I think it will be difficult for them to do this in such a tight labor market but I think I think that they could be successful with this the only thing that I think prohibits them from it is that their reputation has taken such a hit over the last few years that people might be hesitant to sign up for it but\nYou know ... if let's say let's say you live in town and you don't own a car she can't drive ... uh but you're looking to pick up a few bucks I could've seen myself in my early twenties then yeah I'll go work a ah I'll go work a wedding at this place I've got a you know I've got a suit that I can wear and I'll go show up and go surf people they're not sure\nI guess my question isn't so much whether people would sign up to do the work it's what's the incentive for if someone's having a wedding to go look at Hoover instead of someone who specializes in that exact particular thing that they probably already have relationships with I Would hope price\nThat's however succeeded in what they're currently doing but he loses money on that stuff they do you do I I just I look at it in in where's the long term value what can they what can they do that someone else can't I don't I just I I don't know if I see this being of real value for them\nI I yeah I think there's potential for them you know given their scale given they're already existing expertise on paying these people on\nGetting them into their network I think they have the potential to really do something here\nAnd if they do I can see them severely under cutting you know the other staffing agencies that currently do this today and yeah you know we always say well no this company's got such expertise in it that ... couldn't just step in and do that but you know what there are plenty of companies that Cohen disrupt industries that you think might have an area of expertise and then\nThere's a good point a story in the wall Street Journal the headline is oil prices fall further on rising us oil

everything you you have to pay its a bucket of capital yes a\nCashier putting all the cash or you got an ... year okay I feel more badly just by the customers and cashier they're going to get over it they'll figure it out yeah customers are the ones that no one behind you Chuck within I don't feel judged okay\nYou know I can deal with cashiers like I can deal with it you know but I was cast you know worked at that job I Know how it is so so did you\n... are you know did you like not appreciate customers as much because they weren't tipping\nTipping is what bothered me so much was customers who were actually route throughout any process more like typical like you don't know necessarily what a customer's going through they might be going through financial tough times maybe they can't tip you the same way that they normally would [laughter] so I don't blame customers you know because you don't know what's going on under the hood there\nBut that doesn't mean again just 'cause like you can't tip doesn't mean you can't be nice because it doesn't cost anything to be nice to a cashier cars look it's tough job sometimes so what what got more under my skin wasn't customers who didn't hit me it was customers who are rude to me for absolutely no reason because\nLook just and you don't have to do that that's something easily within your control\nA tech set of the five oh wait a I think feeling pressure or over this tipping situation is a little bit odd no one is putting pressure on you so maybe it's just guilt\n[noise] well it could be you know my mother worked hard on guilt maybe paying off [laughter] you know let's talk about doubt du\nPont they recorded a four point six billion dollar charge or in their agriculture unit what's this related too much\nLike you just have seen a pretty big slow down and you know declining valuations of the agricultural sector as a whole largely because of tariffs and so with all the accusations that acquisitions that they have made they've really had to take a good hard look at the value of their agriculture unit and in this case they had to record\nThat yeah you know what what we thought this stuff was worth was actually worth four point six billion dollars less than our initial estimates how much this the biggest trade related\nYou know a good chunk but I don't think you would take a four point six billion dollar charge off if you thought a hundred percent of that was trade related because trade related can be temporary ... so I I think a good portion of this has to be you know ... the goodwill and do other stuff here just isn't worth what it was um\n... but some of it straight to lead to a good a good chunk of it's got to be but not all that we\nHaven't talked in a while now about a Amazon H cute too which is probably the single biggest a project that somehow you know taxpayers don't realize they're going to be on the hook for when it's all said and don't do it all these tax breaks that Amazon's likely going to get\nBut Amazon apparently is revisiting some cities as they are trying to wrap this decision making process up by the end of the year ah it was when we first heard about this was about a year ago\nNow God I don't know it feels like decades ago that we've been talking about this I think it was about a year ago but apparently they are doing bad too so the production walnut we have was dating back to September seven twenty Seventeen just over a year or a year now\nAnd so I guess apparently they've gone back now to New York city to Newark New Jersey to Chicago they've also been following up with a couple of cities like Miami in DC uh a couple of cities just haven't heard from them at all and a few months apparently Raleigh North Carolina hasn't heard from them I guess\nBut so the only thing that I think you can derive from the story because we do this every week oh Jeff Bezos responded in Petra so they're going to choose that his best tracking yeah I think the ... it's like a A R where's Waldo type of scenario here\nBut I I think the only real thing that I've been able to garner from this is there seems to be a slight\n...\nI don't know preference for a metro city area rather than more of a rural area\nI'm standing by my prediction that this is all miss direction they've already built in Boise Indiana voted no and if you're just going to they're just going to be hate like we've got Amazon Boise open ended no one had any coup was coming in there it's done and it's finished [noise] that's that's what I'm sticking\nWith now I think it's going to be a very big city I I Would very much doubt that it can be New York New York or Chicago I just don't think that those states have the right tax situation to allow Amazon to be there but I can be around we'll see\nWhat let's ask a different question we we've asked before you know where do we think Amazon ends up with the second headquarters\nWhen do you think they finally make a decision\nI have to hope that they do it by endear picketing ah\nDecember thirtieth December fifteenth\nNovember twenty nine oh All right I'm going November twenty ninth or making a decision you can put those up on the protests and a half to get what why else would I have done that higher there\nThere's no point in me do that when I put it on record I was December thirtieth Mike was chains assisting and shock was actually no I'm I'm ... don't get ... get out I did it we ... no matter no you catch any I didn't know that no I don't change is November twenty third\nNow I Want the twenty third to like ... I Want to explain why though okay let's hear Black Friday they're going to steal all the laws from Black Friday you know what I like that take enough where I Will change it OK November Twenty one me over there I I think\nThat's a pretty good one right there 'cause then also you get Cyber Monday the following month like it's going to be the twenty third maybe I won't do two dates 'cause that's not right\nThe twenty third of the twenties so this is right rules or just the closest closest closest you know there's just whoever's closest on this we're gonna take a break and when we come back we're

hipsters but it's more important than that this is also saying hey we've got something so secret and so special here\nIt isn't for every one no I don't think that's what they're doing what I hear it's literally a corn in Nebraska so that they're trying to build exclusivity there\nOh they're trying they are there's a bunch of bad posters they can go look up online there's one people hiking and just
