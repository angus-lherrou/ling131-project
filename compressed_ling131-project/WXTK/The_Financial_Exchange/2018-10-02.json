CEO remember\nYou know and this is why I wanted ... fired back in February I said\nHey he told us that everything he in every city Odessa is right as soon as you get in office you blame everything predecessor and and you flush all the bad news he did that in\nNovember and then he goes oh well I've made a mistake and then last week he goes to the board and says\nYou know I forgot about the power division and yell and other twenty three billion there the board said screw it up the board was furious\nI think you're right I mean the bottom line is that if we can defend ... the argument here is that he was too deliberative\nThat's a a a generous way of describing what you've just described and so he was deliberative he's been slow and executing the plan now he's been slow into vested in some of the industries in businesses that they want to get out of\nThe restructuring is behind plans now the argument in his defense is that he's talking about literally restructuring an entire large company and he wants to be carefully gets it right and he wants to ... and he's a deliberative guy by nature\nThe board feels like they need someone to step in take charge and the stuff that he wanted to do we need to do yesterday no so the argument for GE is whatever their plan is it's rolling into high gear ASAP and if you look at the track record of Larry cult yeah let's talk about ... comes over\nEat the he actually took a seat on the board of directors in April maybe was earlier this year okay even his record at Dana her is amazing is it a he was fourteen years CEO I looked at a stock chart bury it was literally a straight line up with no tips for fourteen straight years\nUh he increased the value of that company from\nNine point seven billion we took over to fifty billion dollars when he left in fourteen years she uh she's run one of the largest science and technology conglomerates in the world and he didn't\nUnbelievable job I the further away left in her that's exactly my point is this guy is only like in his mid fifties I figure if you're fifty five years old and he has a track\nRecord that would make any CEO jealous\nOr why he was immediately available and why he was a stupid Dana hers is listed on board that's the only thing he can attributed to ready done it yet and they're done that you know and he sees this as an opportunity to do something really big I mean this is a great historic American name and General Electric my only criticism is is that he teaches\nAt Harvard [laughter] you won't hold up against that I bet he doesn't teach there anymore [laughter]\nBut Larry ... yeah no I think he's he's got a real job now or any has an unbelievable track record and investors are definitely viewing this favorably well so let's talk about that are BC raised their price targets fifty but to ... over a J. P. Morgan still hasn't at ten [noise]\nWow yeah I mean ah maybe there's more cockroaches fly in the stock\nI actually own some ya I sold mine yeah well you did a good it's a bit the bullet and I ...

actually the cost of the clothing now they've ... they've technology costs and things like that the clothing the markup\nLike if you look at a pair of sneakers might cost new balance a dollar twenty to make the sneakers and they sold us for Seventy five bucks yeah yeah same thing with close right blue jeans shirts\nThe markup that sure you're aware now it's probably like a what a sixty Seventy dollars ... you're probably cost like a dollar twenty to make okay but I get that but stitch fixes to I'm a middle man so to speak\nAnd they can't get the shirt for a dollar for they they don't pay much for them or really yeah you look at that algae either look at their balance ... there were they're spending their money is on client acquisition and so you might look at it and say well this is

there fire up the media player and watch the show while your base to the financial exchange radio network\nHow we talked about a product reduced triglycerides last week and say we're going to look at the company the stock of the company that actually makes the\nOn a jolt McCann from seeking alpha joined us Joe thanks for joining us this morning it's going to be on again yeah jump to the company and this fish oil capsule what it's all about\nYeah so am rent the company has one drug approved called us and the type of purified fish oil and they've had this drug on the market than a two thousand\nTwelve and really there was a big debate around whether or not it actually how people live longer than a heart attack within like a great so we knew that it lowered triglycerides impatience particularly if you let them very high mhm whether that mattered in terms of your life than I was really worth the time and money to do it\nWas something that was up for debate until recently\nThat's interesting I I I've dealt with high triglycerides myself and I know people who also deal with it and I was under the presumption that triglycerides were even a bigger problem and cholesterol but you're saying that was not a Scientifically Proven\nHad rabbits and so you know a lot of these drugs\nAnd or an intervention ... think about\nYou know hey it probably is a problem it looks like we have no animal model like that but until you do with this company did which you know an eight thousand person study over six seven years to get it finished but over a long period of time and actually measure the number of heart attack the number of deaths the number of\nIssues along those lines go into the hospital you don't know for sure so it could be that you know the ... the cholesterol is not really that bad and so this is the study that really took a very hard look at it with real an aunt that people care about obviously\nGoing back to that don't kill you exiting that\nCameron stock as we reported took off it tripled and a very short period of time but this is not exactly a diversified company hammer and this is the Raleigh product right\n[noise] yes they are only product and I think that was holding back for a long time I mean to give you a little bit of the legacy your fish oil a lot of people debated how innovative it was the company spent a lotta years getting bound you around this product and we don't need to get into all that but they did it\nAnd then there's this this trial hanging over head where you know what if it didn't work with anyone get treated for it so maybe the drug doesn't go away but becomes extremely mentioned small and you know\nRather than having the potential huge market open to them now it could have been all but close to them\nSo we've learned that triglycerides are in fact a potential real problem for people in terms of cardiovascular risk and we've learned that fish oil can help that situation right so it's a kind of a two prong thing that we've kind of cross the border on\nYeah and I'm a second round up tell you you know one of the reasons people were very skeptical that other show product failed to a trial this similar type of thing that people have their doubts the argument has always been in this goes back to the the argument and a lot of the\nRationale for the drug that you know there's a purified form a certain type called ETA and that that is really concentrated on the show you're taking and it's really pure than it had a different impact on on survival and and\nBenefit for the patient and said this was really testing that the hypothesis that this is the one right type of intervention that work not just you know when you go to see if you have to get or even this other ... that was recently generic so this strip hitting it really surprises me a lot of people I mean that's part of why so huge that\nJoe do do you like the stock it's a small stock or what are your thoughts about the stock Emery\nYeah some before this came out I had actually done some work by company is going shot in fact and what we do is we interviewed doctors to talk about you but the science of being done and the potential in the market so it's been shall we did this call with a leading cardiologist summer than we already what age do you think it's going to work and be if it does how would you use it\nWhat we found that really

work I think we need them more than me needs\nUs it's an interesting theory they ah ten things to know about the NAFTA deal and to tell you the a lot of a noise is being made over this deal and then I looked at the damn thing not much different I said it's a saying\nNothing like it we went from having access to two point eight five percent of Canada's dairy market up to three point one five or ... like we still don't have access to the dairy market\nUm and they're actually kind of mad that they have to give up like zero point five oh yeah we're giving into trouble like watch the uh the one thing that that's actually pretty good in there I think is especially from a national security standpoint is our cars now have to have Seventy five percent of their parts\nMade in North America\nAnd that's going to be phased in over five years but I Do like the idea is there are certain things that I think we do is there's too many places where we've um\nExtended and an offshore on reduction that are dangerous I give an example um your your kids ever have strep throat\nWhen they're oh yeah you know all that stuff comes from China really now\nWhy it should not do that so imagine you know like you were in a trade war with China you're right you do we really want to get into like\nWe we don't make any of that stuff for rabies an incorrect so yeah that's that's a whole separate issue and it's very important Seventy I you know you're talking about the fact that Seventy five percent of auto components must be built in North America\nRight now the requirement is sixty two and a half percent right so that's a bad I looked at as being pretty significant I I I Would say the President Trump okay that's a that's a when I put that in the ... it's incremental and it's really it's incremental even then it's phased in over five years\nDoes it also tell you how big a business dairy is though that there was this much squabbling about that yeah and both sides are saying wow this is a really big deal\nApparently dairy is a pretty big business yeah well of course we have about everyday or use it every day yeah she's you know dream yeah exactly you know I mean there is a big deal\nUm and we made some progress in that so that's good I thought another issue that kind of I didn't think it was that big a deal but apparently is is that forty five percent of workers\nMust make sixteen dollars an hour or more that struck me as a very honor is pay well that's a big deal in Mexico\nTrue that that's where the ...\nThe Mexican workers in it you know like maybe because I'm counting the U. S. everybody's making over sixty right but in Mexico everybody's making five true and I wonder if that does something to well\nBasically the civil war that was going on in Mexico to me in Mexico you talking about a violent play like don't go there on vacation yeah just [laughter] don't [laughter]\nBut I also wonder if in Mexico would be that affected by it because if we\nCount all the workers in Canada and we count all the workers in the United states and then we add they have huge factories in mixed true\nAnd also just yeah at the at the margin this could keep a lot of jobs from going down there in the future and I think that's the big concern yeah I think from Mexico's perspective they they they're they're looking at it and say the one thing that I'll mention though ... average price of a new car\nOver thirty six thousand bucks now yeah and that brings us back to ... this is it NAFTA deal that we negotiated is going to make cars it won't be long before the average price of the new vehicles forty forty five thousand bucks and no one's going to buy him that well they're not buying them now I Know if you look now\nEvery every like my next car is going to be used vehicle yeah I'm just not going to spend that kind of do on a new car well that's spread between the new car and the high quality used cars\nIs now a very very substantial spread and it's it's moved a lot of people to the used car markets particularly with some of these really high quality leases were low mileage and and and low miles\nNext topic that we're going to talk about is is um China and how they

taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona and the next three months no\nAbout that and the way most is the name of the company that's the subsidiary that Google owns a they're planning to launch a public commercials service without anyone in the driver's seat\nNot an experiment they're actually going to roll it out and uh they're going to be a taxi driver in Phoenix or a limo driver and seeing a probably standing by saying well let's see this work\nUh probably nervous but it it does not think about it right like if you're over what does the newer driver get Seventy five percent of the gross is that I I'm I'm not sure I think that's what his orders so you take out that driver right now I'm just thinking what Google could do to undercut prices like say you\nLive in a Sun City and you're going to the airport and that is normally a hundred dollar\nI didn't know in taxi or ... ...\n... what to cut costs you Google fifty twenty five I mean Google that's true but it is it the whole cost the service is ah the employees yeah Google pilot ... out of business as they roll this out now they're going to have to ... they're going to be a big purchase of cars yeah because you know the nice thing is we're basically picky backs\nOff of other drivers owned vehicles they offer arrangements for the drivers but it's very expensive yes if you want to use one of their vehicles is very prohibitive so yeah they're going to become a ... you can see those the auto industry\nThey're really cozying up to them because they realize that could be a huge source of their future revenues well and you think about the companies that have you know they're trying to catch up\nA test those had a number of accidents is on the road\n... killed somebody and they in Phoenix yeah they're exactly and so you know there there's you know the history here that things haven't always worked out quite perfectly on in the experimentation phase of this it'll be interesting to see how this rolls out and how effective it is I I still think there are major obstacles\nTo fully autonomous vehicles in the United states for a lot of reasons I I continue to believe that we're going to become increasingly autonomous and maybe three quarters autonomous or Ninety five percent autonomous\nBut getting there with driverless I just think it's going to be\nA tough road to hoe no fun to do I I Want to see what happens I think the Knicks is a great market to look at it it's a huge city yeah you know you've got I don't know what the population's got to be I think is one of the top ten cities\nIn the country in terms of population oh yeah and if you can all the sudden drive the cost of a taxi ride down by fifty percent\n... you're putting everybody out of business yeah I mean this would be a a major game changer but uh again there there were logistical challenges here mhm and I think the whole world will be watching just to see how well this works\nCalifornia Rhode Island West Virginia Kentucky and Florida suffer from the most opioid abuse this according to fare health a New York based nonprofit I the opioid problem is not going away\n... it's estimated and you talk about economic impact obviously the culture impact as devastating a five hundred billion dollar annual costs to our economy yeah remember these are people who have jobs these are people who mostly very productive good people who um\nAre stuck with a absolutely horrible situation and you know Rhode Island being in the top four\nIs uh is sober and the ... the you once you're hooked on this huge changes a person you know quest and you're you're you know like at Princeton University did or ... puts in college I Can't remember the\nThe they did a study about drug addiction chemical dependency and the impact that it's having on labor participation 'cause how long have we talked about the oh shoot she labor participation rate is still low and you make all kinds of excuses you say well it's an older population blah blah blah blah well the fact the matter is\nLabor participation is really not very good and the the number you all you have to do is look at Yale PR for twenty five fifty four men yeah it's it's a tragic number and a lot of it\nIt fifty percent of the decline is based on drug addiction and alcoholism and those numbers you're talking about our our our relative numbers and yeah you're ... look not everyone in that age group is going to go on to go to work for a lot of reasons some of them are lazy let's be honest but\nEven accounting for that it's not like people got demonstrably lazy or it can run out of the year Santa drug addiction and yet that number clearly is impacted by drug addiction and the really tragic thing here is\nWe're now seeing that there were doctors talking about the fact that these things were not really that addictive and recommending prescriptions of large doses of opioids on a daily basis\nThat there was an addiction problem and we know that was a categorical absolute lie\nA and just knowing that is what makes this even more difficult\nTo to deal with to accept that doctors drug companies a lot of people culpable if there is good news is that we are actually making some progress on this we're seeing all the numbers are high they're starting to drop off\nYou've seen the ads that you know governor bakers running on Yelp touting the fact that of Massachusetts yeah these numbers are still high but they're coming down you know and that's because a lot more resources being dedicated to opiate addiction and a lot more awareness slip\nAnybody right now looking at opioids as as an option now understands what the rules are right they understand this would be a bit potentially have always had dogs are pulling way back on their prescriptions you walk into a pharmacy to pick up your prescription for opioids\nLet me tell you I did that for my son when he had his Achilles' taken and um\nThey're very difficult to to get the prescriptions now
