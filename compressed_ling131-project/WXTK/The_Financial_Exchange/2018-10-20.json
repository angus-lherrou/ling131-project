the ones that you want to leave the stem as long as the stem looks flashy and greenish not brown and dried if it's brown and dry just clipping off\nYeah that's what I have yes but\nIf it's flashy and greenish they can put out a a little bud ah from that same stem and make another bloom stem off of that original stem and sometimes what helps that to happen D\nIs if you clip the very tip off so let's say you're or could as flowered right all the flowers are gone then clip that flowering stem back by two or three inches and leave the bloom stem there and see if it produces another you know off off shoot\n[noise] that's what I have done one one that just stopped okay good it was it to them one time it would have a nice one of them dried up the other one is still green but it's um

phones and talk to Joan from Hyannis morning Joan\n... good morning I have a comment\nAnd a question and comment is when you're talking about a plant\nIn detail\nUsually this plant needs but would you repeat the name of the plant because if I'm walking around [laughter] I think gee I Wonder if that's the plan I'm worried about\nOh okay well I'll Try and remember doing that Joanne but you know what uh if if I if I constantly say the name of the plant it it gets a little repetitive for somebody who's focusing on the program you know what I'm saying if I say a\n... you know Ammar Ellis needs this would be sure to put your ... and ... says it gets a little repetitive so I'll I'll Try and repeated a little more often but you know what you can always give a call and say what was that plant that you were just talking about [laughter]\nLike on my question is yes my shivering and Nicole okay what happens next\n... next to bring it in the house and and you need to bring it in before Sunday night because it will die if you leave without a overnight on Sunday okay\nWell we're really cold I put it in the ... yeah well\n... it's good to leave them out as long as possible in the fall because they do need those chilling periods in order to set flowers but since you've left it out pretty much until now it should be in great shape now um I Would bring it in now and I would put it in a\nCall ... room if you have one but one where there's pretty bright bright light or you know some direct sun good okay and um and did you fertilize it at all during the summer\nNo but I just heard about from the cold a few minutes\nOkay next summer be sure and give it some fertilizer during a you know when you put it outside the mosque\nCoat on it it's it's ... bloom on the newest growth they don't bloom on the older growth\nSo you want to be sure and stimulate new growth off the sides so if your plant 'em this year doesn't come back into flour it's because it didn't produce enough new growth\nIs a lot of happy new green leaves\nWell that's good and do they come off the outside or their new shoots and their new shoe okay good well then it should flower for your right keep it someplace cool\nUm and and you know water at a at least once a week depending on what is ... and it should come into power [noise]\nGood I Will report that guy ... I Hope so good thank you you have a great weekend sim idioms are one of my favorites certainly well thank you so much for being with me joined me again next week here on news radio Ninety five W ... [noise]\n\n\n\nAre getting jobs local news is already nobody likes the K ... job and I hardly radio station use radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I monitor the Saudi Arabia is admitting a journalist died and says it happened during a fist fight at the Saudi constantly in Turkey ABC's in panel it's outside the constantly\nI Would ask you a question do you see that financial planners are taking people's retirement pension and the lake and transitioning them into a safer haven like a bond\nWell that's a question that we can ask 'em I as because he's got his finger on the pulse they're okay with the clients and seeing what they're doing but if we took a look at the market\nOr this week uh up and down you know up Ninety One down a fifty seven up three or five hundred and thirty seven down fifty six and in between uh the uh bill had a\nNine thirty and the closing bell at four o'clock we could wander somewhere up and down something like five hundred six hundred points so um it was one of\nThose roller coaster rides that cost a lot of money and stand in line for a long period of time to get on the line you're on your your it takes your breath away\nIt didn't take your breath it it was a ... market some people refer to it as the rocking chair market we had a lot of movement but we really didn't uh we really didn't get anywhere ah the thing here is that uh\nWe um for the week for all the volatility we had I think for the Dow Jones industrial points we actually gain\nA hundred and four points are about half a percent of the week and uh that puts us up about two point three percent for the year\nThat went down and we're down from what are we were last week which was extremely volatile we lost a great that there but we're up on the S. and P. the five hundred\nThat see about six tenths of a point rise and even as the cubs finished just off a little bit but we have been seeing in the NASDAQ which is up if we took the NASDAQ one hundred the winner about eleven o'clock ... o'clock excuse me about eleven\nPercent that we find that uh the\nStocks such as um the face of the things stops it to the Facebook the apple than Netflix which have very good earnings this week and the Google which now notice alphabet they have been declining because people are not\nFiguring they may be worth as much as they were and we can talk about that when we talk about this housing decline as well this really pricey in investors' minds based upon what's happening in the market\nAnd I think that's a that's a good place to take a little break there so we're going to be back and here's what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about the real estate market cooling down because it happened in a blink\nIt happened in a blink people who decided to put their homes on the market recently have have realized that um there are so many lines at least here on Cape Cod I mean I was involved in a bidding war this past week\nAnd a that was in Marshfield to actually have clients that have been looking all summer long they have probably made offers on [noise]\nI Want to say at least twenty properties and had been outfitted every time so we put our thinking caps on this time and we we said okay here they are they have sold their house their house is gone and they have found another house this one was on\nA it was actually near the water so we're looking at upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars with the asking price\nThey went in with a full price offer and they used that escalation clause that so many people talk about and that escalation has allowed them\nTo offer a thousand dollars over it the asking over the the highest bidder\nAnd it allowed them to close within a thirty day timeframe and it allowed them to\nActually have their offer except that so uh that escalation causes something that people should think about if they're involved in a bidding multiple betting war\nAnd I'm making a strong offer that are going to talk about making his strongest and best offer because that even even now it's going to be relatively important and we're going to talk to you about some tips that we can share a far realtors out their overcoming some of the actions that you may be involved in\nWhether it's at an open house or whether it's at the time that the offer is being made in your faced with a wholesale contingency\nHow um how are you going to handle those things we've got some answers for you and we'll be back with those answers after these message has\nThis report is brought to you by indeed dot com or at six is

quirky novelty into a practical and substantial mainstream option\nIn addition to being a pleasure to drive the Prius was lauded year after year by nearly every consumer publication you can name as being a top pick for reliability dependability in overall value\nIt's acclaimed hybrid Dr system can not only save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars per year it was also proven itself to be one of the most trustworthy drive trains offered by any manufacturer in any vehicle right now that I'm a Toyota has one of the best selections of the entire Prius family we've ever had and our team of sales professionals\nWould love to show you how truly affordable and economical and new Prius can be\nTo come by and see us we're just a mile and a half south of the born bridge or online at ...\nEarnings that the people were expecting to build up the growth stocks thanks dogs are they came out with a marvelous a report of increasing up to twenty nine million customers a year now most of them overseas however a ... eleven percent one day\nDown ... percent the next day wow so um that ... or ... it was a real ride a traders market wonderful but overall the projections are still rising even through the beginning of two thousand Nineteen we've got the Santa Claus rally coming up so all this bouncing up and down\nUm and of factors of the Chinese market has been cooling we've got\nA number of people who\nAre filled out the whole world economy is slowly the international Monetary Fund said that a bank of America came out with a a projection that it's the worst growth in the world economy since two thousand eight and I don't know where they get that from\nBut we've got inflation we've got the usual suspects and as you've been talking about the housing market down three point one percent poor pointed three percent for the year lowest since two thousand twelve in this last seven months here but it's still fifty percent up from the bottom\nI'm heritage was suspects walks a lot of the lack of supply mhm prices are up to ... soldiers backed off rising interest rates sellers gave it a second thought\nSo the buyers have to figure just as the market is readjusting prices of a security is\nA the ... have to readjust their prices and we're trying to bring that lack of inventory a into balance with the buyers who are still in demand if we can start to give the cell that is a an indication that their prices probably not what I thought it was\nThen the deals can be made and we're back contracted\nRight there are a couple of factors that are going on right now there is a cooling in the real estate market yet and we're seeing more inventory coming on which is a great thing we have a bunch of people out there who are looking all summer long demand is ... so the demand is there and\nThere's going to be an opportunity for those folks who did not buy during that hotter market there's going to be an opportunity for these folks to actually\nBe able to walk in\nAnd really negotiate now because it was really no negotiation before now that would be the worst in in one of the things that I Want to leave 'em listeners who aren't shopping around for a house if you have plans to do home improvements or to use equity in your home\nBetween now and seven years from now\nI Would encourage you to take a home equity line of credit out\nAnd the reason that I'm encouraging you to do this is because if you wait until mid year next year\nYour home's value the appraisal is going to be based on the last three months so we're coming into the winter months\nWere coming into a typical slower period of time and if you're thinking all take out a home equity line of credit or I'll refinance my house in the spring\nThink again because those rates are probably going to be increased maybe by quarter maybe by a half we don't know we don't have a crystal ball if we had a crystal ball we certainly share that information with you\nBut if you take out a home equity line of credit or you refinance your house right now that appraiser is going to use sales in the last three months and those were probably the peaks of the market\nSo if you're thinking do I have enough value in my home you need to to really rethink or when you're actually going to pull that trigger when you're going to pull the\nPlug and so in terms of in terms of that are just food for thought it's just a a recommendation you don't have to do it but\nLike always I Believe that you'll save yourself some some money if you do home equity lines of credit if you take them out and don't use them you don't pay on them and uh they float with prime rate on refinances again\nYou want to get your financial house in order before the feds increased the rates again do it sooner than later and I'm going to let you introduce our guest\nElapsed theloop Lee I'm a\n... is the online quote an ad on the line well good morning I'm we um have been talking about the interviews and black with us from this guy is more than a Mahmoud yeah are you on the line I Am online\n\nCan you hear me\nYes we can you want to tell you where he's from al ...\nDoes [laughter] are we getting a little bit of radio um static in here this morning I as the c._e._o. of West branch capital which is a a\nA New England financial advisor refer him and he's kind enough to share his a Saturday morning time and I do thank you I as much pressure to contribute his thoughts on the main question here I is is um [noise]\nWe have people retiring now the I'm\nThe baby boomers are hitting sixty five plus they're looking for a little safety of course in their retirement but also to keep up with inflation\nAnd in this kind of a market that we've seen in the west to east going up and down I'm sure they have to love the question so a good morning again I us and I'm\nLike what do you uh what kind of questions are um are you getting up there was branch\n[noise] in terms of the of the time to retire [noise]\nUm you know the the lord of the investors that particular I'm On my focus on of course my relationships and uh at our phones clients um and I've been doing this for thirty five years um\nWe prepare the clients for this volatility fairly applying for a minute any advisors showed a [noise] a forty longer um\nA process but most importantly be protected um uh to understand their financial situation and their um their ability to\nDo which the end of a twenty percent drop or thirty percent drop in the stock market and that really brings to the question of what I said I'll occasion you'll have should you have a what exposure should you have to go to the stock market you know they would have found it to some some investors that I'm thinking of our clients\nHave been um stock investors all their lives and they haven't noticed that tradition or process from a you know generations and they said they ruled withstand\n'em and understand that market can drop 'em fifty percent as a drawdown was in a two thousand nine to two thousand two thousand nine so I think it's um the we have to avoid the short term nature\nAction reaction when we thinking of long term planning um because it really hurt your um either you left behind or and or ... that I don't think that's such a big issue right now give her the market so I'm Talking the stock market is um\nAnd then it doesn't necessarily and also of course have a new system have risk a management um policies in place in terms of ... and taught in the stock market to pull the plug it's on a certain level on particular positions [noise] um anyway I Hope it on says your question I can\nGo on and on it [laughter] I Know I I Know I as you have a great deal of experience in the market going back or\nThirty years and we are I'm Glad you were able to come I'm Sorry about the introduction he has done little no worse but I think one of the things that has been going on in the market and is very important for investors to know is that uh\nWe have a change in something called apply do share a rule or we had anticipated the change and there really has not been one but\nOne of the things that people get confused about uh they have been in a market for a number of years but now things are changing in their lifestyle how did they choose an investment advisor how did they choose a financial advisor in what's the difference between a for ...\nAnd let's say a financial advisor who has that title at Merrill Lynch\nSo maybe along to the second question first um this is the difference is um\nThe\nI I I've gone through this whole process of going from a a broker to a an investment of registered investment advisor or we were the responsibility so when it first started in the business we would start brokers I mean it'd be in the eighties you we did\nWe bought and sold bonds and we bought and sold stocks but we will call stockbroker\nSome brokers right I did that as well yeah and\nAnd and I think the business models changed where um if I call them um if the companies I mean the big banks are I've worked for a all three with the big banks are good people need in order to know Morgan Stanley was Smith Barney end up leaving brothers I managed the uh the\nWhy why do we need to be wondering offers and mutual fund or if I'm a you know because of course there's alert on those those\nThat do have to disclose and you can find out which is a big commission and so and so forth I don't want to dwell too much on it\nThat there is in ... it would\nBe getting a lot into the er the weeds as they say is an eye out those weeds are important they are really leave their hands and I want to go direct\nSo that the lesson as can kind of get shuffled through this and I understand what questions should they asking if they're walking into a\nTiny angel institution and you're seeing a financial adviser what kinds of questions direct questions should they be asking\nI think the first um it it important question is is to the uh important question is what conditions will I be paying what kinds of products are they going to use to deliver the financial plan\nUm if all of the funds being recommended or the the the firm's own funds or I Would you know that should be a red flag why is it why is it not diversified if if they're using funds um\nI think it's fairly um reasonable to last a boss for any disclosures on the uh brokers record or you know a stew if if you're going to broke reject or because you would have to awesome um and that sort of [noise] of gives you the ... the the background off the broker\nUm and then on of course call themselves brokers now so whichever for national institution you're going\nI'm generally how is the\nUm advisor compensated arguing salary in bonus in these big institutions chances are no um and therefore how are they getting compensated I think that's probably the number one most important thing\nAnd it was brands capital of one or the from that you form a here how are you compensated how was the from a competent\nMust do we we charge a fee or to the client\nUm and we own and we have no side deals we don't get compensated by anyone else so if you own a vanguard fund vanguard doesn't ... or send us the world be one fee accomplish compensation um and so it's really you going in hiring an accountant or you're going and hiring a lawyer [noise]\nUm and by the lawyers for degree as well to their clients um and we um and that's and we just thought it was that right up front before he was a ... at the time of us who you when you can't us\nAnd then we actually disclose\nThat fee on a quarterly basis I'm On a in a building statement that you get and exactly how we got closer to the uh so there there is nothing and of course out of protective is if you funds are we use individual security's a ... a lot of ... as well or bonds instructions on so full of we try to get the lowest\nOf funds as possible and as well as a no load funds are and know back and loads because guess what we're not getting compensated by the mattress on company\nWell I I think um you know the fact that ah it's a ... pretty much a one the only for the oversight was branch capital a little bit about the the background here it'd be it'd be a company\nSo I was in an office in New Orleans you know\nYes I have an office in Orleans um and a three wonderful people associated with the office I'm Deborah Davis and stop listening to general marsh\nUm and then come to the the I think if you ... you you kind of hit it something that I had mentioned the the in our case include financial planning investment management and a review of contracts or pictures that book sales people will call her insurance for uh people including long term care\nA review or for contracts or that you may not have shouldn't sign up for all you've talked to was particularly annuity contracts\nAre so it's a complete financial relationship I'm for that one feet that um that um that you would know precisely at the start of our relationships with the disorder to complete that go toward um\nAs far as the excuse me I'm Sorry yes so that the U.S transaction cans action based\nNot at all you know in fact we we are the students have been very kind to us the transaction cause for us to train below in fact I Would say the minimal and ah if I'm In it\nFor you know if you if you buy stock if he by building a portfolio and other conservatives have become a very very competitive ah so you know unless you can see the ads you know it'll touch photos and only five cents a transaction\nOr in some cases it's just a few cents\nMhm but if I have a three hundred thousand I have a hundred thousand I have a hundred million or a different presented\nSo let's say one present one and a half percent if something is a west branch capitals compensation for doing financial planning for doing recommendations based on the best efforts are for what the client hopes to achieve\nFeel different portfolios for different types of clients and different stages of their lives\nUm it's a west branch capital is not a a Morgan Stanley it's not a I'm a bank of America it's not a one man office it is a fairly broad range of capital but uh how many people do you have\nTo be eleven um and but I Would I be brought something up in my mind is really important we're independent [noise]\nI'm a registered investment advisers so by independence we don't look for any of the big problems we can work with the ... any of the big problems it's if it makes sense to the to the client in other words um we can buy bonds from a big from that is really good at\nA trading bonds rat can get it right so I can throw a prime brokerage wanted to get him technical I can buy that we can watch them\nAll to treat them from a book or is a big a big banks that bond traders and said gee you know we're looking for an IBM bond uh for about a million dollars how much would it be and we can compare with are we getting a good price ... not a because because there's some independent I'm not we're not getting what you as you note at a mock up on these boats\nAnd as an independent from I as a ... you can perhaps have more contact with your clients um [noise] or as much as they want this is sometimes not something that you see some for some of the big uh [noise] that's right\nYeah we we are I'm\nExactly I mean I Would think um like we we will be in a meeting with you if you were doing a district plan for instance uh so we're going to uh you know for taxation for tax issues um we have run\nInto it was very good at taxes and we like to have somebody like that and from what we would meet with an accountant or to you and may give us suggestion father taxes I Do believe we work with the lawyers and accountants I think it's really\nA one of the uh it sometimes you know I don't know what questions ... um and sometimes it isn't Ali relationship it can be costly so we we can\nAt least at the beginning of guidance and even more than on meeting if necessary a particularly when it comes to state plants people tend to avoid them you know people don't\n... revisited wheels or they don't don't look at their trust\n'em and so that's kind of relationship just leads to what you're saying that you have to make a conscious do it over the phone or actually can trust what you want to sit with a lawyer and see what the lawyers are saying\nAnd I have to say we've had a very very good experience with that with triangulating are professionals financial professionals that matter too much wellbeing matters for their Family Matters for the future and we want to know what's going on that part and uh and we do know should give them the experience we have\nWe're thinking about as it's been very um a very uh ... as to what's going on in this I think one of the key things is um\nThe younger people from the article I read in the wall Street Journal they want contact with their advisors more often the older people with experience or a little less often but they do want to keep in touch you know they can\nRaise the phone or either have a monthly talk or quarterly talk or whatever your customers a new clients need it's a one stop the operation and it is a produce Uri operation that isn't the best interest of the clients so um how\n... how many how many clients were three hundred families a three hundred that yeah that's\nA that's certainly manageable to keep a personal touch\nYes yes and you know when you have a I'm a veteran advisors rep of who have some of those friendships\nI tend to as a founder of the sea of the from try to mate and I have met probably eighty five but I should really go to specific number because I haven't done the calculation I replied over the phone with a personally so they know that I I Know who they are I Know what they're trying to get done I'm so\nThank you I as much I Believe there was a little ranch capital of the we have how do they reach with sprint\nCup of political leans office or five or eight I'm five nine eight hundred again [laughter] five or eight to five five nine eight zero zero I Am making so much for joining us my pleasure alternatives hopeful that by\nListening to the Cape ... we are ending the program if you have any questions five zero eight two six four four eight zero five or need financing this weekend cause my dad had a great weekend Cape Cod\nIt's all know and we have people in Massachusetts who still vote Democrat it is absolutely incredible frightening and extremely sad for the future\nPeople in my generation post World war two are seeing things we never believed possible\nThey're seeing things on television hearing things reading things that are absolutely positively unbelievable\nFor those of us that grew up people pulled together they had their differences but America came first people lost children lust brothers lost fathers\n\nBut not anymore greed greed greed\nAnd the need to be somebody has taken over it's in the schools it's in politics to a huge huge situation\nAgain this is talk radio and we're glad\nTo have you listening and hopefully have you participated and we have lots of good things to talk about first let's congratulate the red Sox I was a baseball player love the game my dad played for the old Boston Braves years ago\nAnd uh this team was really an exciting team\nAnd I love\nThe manager\nHe was one of the best things in the whole\nSeries because he's got sanity he's not on an ego trip he smiled as a whip and he's not afraid to pull somebody out of a game put somebody in the game not afraid of his press judging him\nBut the team was exciting oh you and uh it was really a wonderful thing but again here's where the gripes come from Donald Pima keg the games are too long and too late\nSo or football games and the greed is just so evident now and that is\nYeah deaf to add to add to have ads overlapping\nAds they have the screen where the ball game is taking half the screen the other half is in that\nThere is no end to it and it ruins a lot of the game for a lot of us\nWhen you're still watch it a ball game at eleven thirty it's disgraceful and it affects schools it affects the kids want to watch a ballgame\nIt affects people going to work the next day but nobody is why because the world the world is now being controlled frightening lead\nBy the machinery\nOf cell phones televisions everything your own automobile or even talking and they're producing cars that drive themselves and\nNobody thinks that that is is not a good thing for people's independence I just you know it just is amazing to me that there is no stopping it you know another American Pastime is being used strictly by the media\nAnd I also get so sick I Love Nolan Ryan if you saw the last game he was well I guess\nIs there other games his wife I Know is that every game he was always a hero he was a great pitcher pitch for food different teams and he still holds records for strike out and for I think he pitched eight no hitters which is unheard of uh for any one picture to pitch that many\nAnd uh I saw and they've had him on the screen he's gotta he's I Know one of these part owner but he's a definitely one of the um stock holders and owners of of Houston\nAnd I watched him 'cause I keep thinking I'm the only one that thinks this way but I Know I'm not but\nWe're all the things the way I think I guess\nThese announces they could not shut up for two seconds and aren't used to be nice to have the batter and the batter's box the pitcher on the mound getting ready to pitch and not sound\nJust wait for the ball game to go they\n... they got to tell you how many kids and how many wives and how many what school and the ... while the guy while the\nGame's going on and they do it and foot\n... and again while I'm not going to apologize but I'd love to hear seven seven five nine Ninety five a one eight eight eight WRX TK nine for one am I just another old\nCrank or does it matter I guess it doesn't matter it is just again these ads little things they uh are they a frightening things that uh I I just\nThere's more things being taken away from us a by those people who are absolutely\nAre breaking the seven cardinal sin greet last slot we got it all the time\nSo anyway that's the first thing or a ... the games and then we'll we'll

than the rest\nOf us I Want to tell you about welcome back on the way in I was listening to uh to Fox new Kudo and Fox just did a poll and you'll be I think emboldened by this Seventy six percent\nOf the population including Democrats\nIndependents and Republicans is is there a brand new poll\nSaid that they want secure borders\nThey want to stop that caravan at the border if they do not want crime in their communities and don't understand why the Democrats are fighting about this these were Democrats that were involved in this latest Fox poll so\nWell but again Steve yeah as a former Democrat myself for years\nThe answer so clear this is what so many of us are so frustrated with\nThe reason the Democrats keep doing it is because they keep getting re elected unit with Democrats up there yeah but you're not allow farmers but maybe not now I mean how can you allow I'm an an a first generation immigrant Irish\nMy father came over for they had to have specific rules now you've got

College of obstetrics and gynecology he was the fellow at a at so many places he he was a it was just a a truly remarkable man but he drew his ... joy and he told me this many times we had some so many conversations I Can't count them\nAs if the biggest fulfillment he had was he developed he developed the delivery can you imagine this over twenty thousand children twenty thousand children\nHe had warned bedside manner an infectious smile dedication to his patients won him the appreciation of constantly countless Cape Cod families\nHe was an adventure he loved to fly he love the outdoors he

other thing in our culture today I mean these are the unsung heroes and that's why I like to mention them on the air because they deserve it a heck of a lot more than professional ball players in some cases who want to demean their own country I Wish people could get that message\nWe're all different but there are so many wonderful wonderful human beings\nThat uh they don't go unnoticed by those if
