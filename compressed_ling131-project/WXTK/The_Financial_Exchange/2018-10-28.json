I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent\nPeople were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you were let go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get that I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's critical of such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see a kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some of the some ... this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more of a more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nHost or to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go away well I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never have got their shops that are just hoping for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but I think what they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nThat now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum fill them so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and become more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are too you know ... or to or how they want\nTo risk to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually a ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the barrel route to the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause it was just getting over on the people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of [laughter] you know bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a part of you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in there to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally where we are at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later than that maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to sort of get for pushing that's a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time though by midnight money around on Halloween\nIs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our [noise]\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really bad

read on the air and hopefully he's the answer will stop you from being one of his next real life stories\nTodd we also talk about how important it is for people to actually fund\nTheir trust so I Know with 'cause you can do and you guys make sure that all the real estate's included that in the real estate is transferred into the trust if we're working together with me to a client we make sure that all those liquid assets get in\nBut for those who are out there many attorneys do not transfer there are real estate in for them so how do you actually transfer real estate\nFrom your own names into your ear evil will trust\nSo we're talking about this irrevocably type yes right although it's not entirely different if you had a revolt couple trust so I just thought I'd throw that out there it's it's really the same so the deed work we prepare because we can do that so we prepare new deeds that actually say you know\nTodd blood ski here by transfers and conveys too you know Billy trustee of the\nTide lucky family or a vocal trust who says right on your feet\nYou guys will know that because you can go look at your real estate tax bill and see that it comes in the name of the trust and not to be fairly well it might an individual right you get scared 'cause you'll see his name I Will probably say Billie trustee and you'll say oh how come it's in Billy's name it's night Billy trustee of the drums\nSometimes they can't fit the whole trust name on there so you might just see Billy as trustee that means that title has been changed and it's now owned by the irrevocably trust good\nBut banking investment accounts same thing you need to actually go to the so like for you to go to your financial advisor chairs and you get forms\nAnd you fill out the forms that actually say I'm you know\nTrain changing title to the account to read\nThe maybe Todd let's keep family irrevocably trust mhm\nPut your name it and then it's in there and you also know what's in their cars you will need a separate tax id number right or the era of a couple of trust what you would not need for the ... a couple of trust you just use or social but you still need to change their name\nAnd that's really how you do it make sure you look at your statements that you get and make sure they come in the name of the trust under the new id number then you know they're in there\nAnd sometimes when you are putting real estate in there you know it can take a couple of months even though that deeds been recorded it can take ... he's a couple of months for you to see that change reflected on your your ... your tax bill and so forth but don't panic if you don't see that\nSo once you actually put your home in your area vocal trust taught him for a lot of people that's their biggest asset is there anything that you can no longer to do with your home\nIf it's owned by the trust you given up any rights to anything\nI Would say the only thing you cannot do would be re mortgage it okay now you can keep existing mortgages first of all most people that are doing Medicaid planning don't have a more they're not concerned but ... but\n... yeah and getting a new thirty year mortgages not high on there to do list mhm so\nProbably not an issue but some people still have the lingering mortgage that has been burying off get it home equity line of credit for whom that line of credit what we do generally is we reserve a life a states this will be one of the times where we actually would reserve the life a state\nIn the deed and by doing that you now preserve the mortgage\nMeaning they won't trigger the due on sale cause you didn't give it away remember we're not giving anything away we're keeping that President right to live there the rest of our lives which is what a life of status mhm\nAnd that means that you have not triggered the due on sale costs so you can keep that existing line of credit or existing mortgage you just can't get a new one\nWithout taking it out of the trust once and it didn't and restarting the clock sweet and then you could get it but you would have to restart\nThe clock so you so if someone doesn't have a balance due to a bank or they don't have a mortgage or they don't have a line of credit would you recommend that they establish a line of credit before they transferred in knowing that they're not going to be able to\nGet one after isn't you know I just thought kind of a personal matter it really matters up to the client you know what do they feel you guys feel like you need that security of being able to borrow money in the future because if you keep the line of credit you can always write the check\nTo borrow up to the limit that your cat because you can use it you can you again way line immigrants just can't get a new one right now you can keep the one you have up to the credit limit that they gave you and the term than they gave you because you preserve that in the life of state\nSo it's really a family matter if you feel that you need that comfort level to say oh my gosh if I Need a new hot water heater I Need a new roof or I Need something that causes a lot of money\nAnd I don't have it otherwise\nThan yeah OK otherwise mostly no\nOkay you know of folks there's a lot of questions that might be going through your mind at All right well what else can I Do when my houses and then tried to sell it can I can I

com for more information member FDIC equal housing lender\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us this thing when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that included in the big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan Bowers and that\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Dave in Boston mass in Dave writes I Am the trustee of my mother's irrevocably trust that trust has been enforced since two thousand nine and has two properties in it\nShe has a number of CDs now can I put those in the same trust if so would this adversely affect the trust and if it is not adversely affected\nHow when with these CDs be protected would there be a five year clock started for the CDs or would they immediately be protected using the trust original two thousand and I start to ... days looking for a loop hole hair\nAnd I'm Wondering if you ask just a few more questions because there's only about Fifteen pounds\nYou're my own heart here he's looking for a loop you got to back you\nKnow there is no loophole here for your buddy but I Do have good news for your overall depending on how old you are I'm In and this is really the question right so he so I'm Sorry how old your mother is to have 'em and and so this becomes a question for all of you when you're doing you're planning and this is why when when we do planning for people\nWe put as much assets as we can in the trust all at one time\nThat being said it doesn't mean you can't add to the trust later if you want to so you got to see deep question here Dave and we certainly can add to the trust later\nBut I'm going to explain the ramifications so depending on mom's age hopefully you put everything and you want it in at one time then you have one five you're waiting period running on the whole thing mhm let's say mom put it in that sixty five\nAnd now she's Seventy and everything she initially put in which is what the two the two properties yup right those are all protected\nSometimes they're not comfortable learning about how the trust really doesn't cause of many problems at all and then after this five years went by and they say you know and I kinda forgot all about the trust it's not hurting me at all not changing my life at all mhm\nMaybe I'll take some of these CDs and put them in there well in my hypothetical for your mother in this case Dave she's now Seventy\nCatch you put the CDs and yes she can will create a new five you're waiting period for her yes it will but only\nOn the new addition that new money so at least you can rest assured that the two houses are protected\nAnd you'd only have to deal with mhm perhaps undoing are dealing with that money that you put in if something happens in the next five years but now you have to get to Seventy five right\nProvided the increase provided that had an increased the waiting period between the time you contributed your house\nAnd the time you contribute to CDs so the answer is yes you can new five o'clock so think about how old you are when you start this right 'cause they did this planning ten years ago run mom while there you go along with\nSeventy at the time ...\nIt's a little harder to undo doesn't mean you don't do it no I think you're still step back and look at her health and say you know while she's in pretty good shape let's let's get another clock started doing it\nSo what do you do Todd if Dave puts the CDs in there now and four years down the road mom goes into their thing and they don't make that five years\nA great question I Would have to decide by looking at and this is where last minute planning comes into play right\nI normally there's things left out of the trust look at this case the for example she lost a lot of money out of the trust all or CDs it and go and I'm sure even though she's putting the CDs and now Dave\nThat she left out of the trust her IRA money and any other money that she just didn't feel comfortable putting in ya mhm\nLet's look at how much that is if she left about a hundred grand outside the trust\nAnd were four years into this new five year waiting period I'm likely to tell the mother in this case or Dave if the mom's going in the nursing home\nLet's private pay with the money you have outside the trust mhm why it's at risk anyway and if I spend a hundred grand to protect all I don't know another five hundred thousand of CDs that I put in the trust I'm OK doing that\nAnd that will get us past that one more year waiting period that we need to get to ... to protect it all otherwise\nNone of that five hundred thousand is protected so think of it as being pro rated in the sense that yeah I've got four years under my belt even those zero of those dollars is protected yet\nI'll pay for a year mhm just to protect the balance of the money that's in there so lots of options get the clock running never a bad idea\nYeah and you know what folks ideally you're going to do your planning in advance\nEducate yourself before you start the process so you know what should and should not being your trust in how these trust operate on a day to day basis\nTodd's guide for the

five WICK [noise]\n\n\n\nStarted\nGoing I'm here in the ... there are\nBefore the break we were talking with John ... questions um the last one was about his\nChristmas cactus\nOr John you still there for me All right so you brought to the uh Christmas cactus and it turned into a Halloween cactus on ya\n[laughter] [laughter] it's it's a beautiful beautiful but John it over ... if you treat it doubled the size this year\nBut yeah it\nIt I'm sure now\nNow you go ahead finish up while you were saying sorry\nYeah it's I just I thought it was a Christmas ... you know it it it seems to be twice a year two years before but the year it seems to be booming a lot earlier\nWell so the ... when did you take it in\nA about two weeks ago when we had those two days of a really bad for us we drop down to a low the twenties at night so I brought it in and just put it where it normally normally ... which\nIs so what could have happened is the uh so it usually Christmas cactus needs that dormant period about six to eight weeks where it's cool\nOr before it hit a forms is buds [noise] um and so usually at the Christmas cactus to get it to bloom a little bit later on\nYou know probably around ... beginning of August ... that I'm a dark cool treatment for about six to eight weeks [noise] towards the end of it that's when the balloons will start to work\nI start to form once in a forum that usually takes about twelve weeks maybe a little bit less for the blossoms to appear so if you think about that that's a uh Eighteen weeks ban so we're talking about four and a half months\nSo if you're looking to get it around Christmas it does have to have a dorm and see period during the summer to get it to to be a little bit later if it doesn't have the ... the period and it's been outside which is fine it's just going to bloom earlier for you\nOkay okay I thought maybe it was one of the other cat that says if they have a ... I'm just booming and choke\nOr just plant yeah I definitely think that that's what's happened it just didn't have that dark period or to get it to push its blossoms to later on\nThat one more question after yeah sure\nUh I'm good at providing and there are about twenty foot tall and I miss fertilizing them in August\nI use plant charm and I\nShould I fertilized now oh can I\nYou want to use anything that you can use a fertilizer use it at half the rate at this time or what I Want you to use the set of plant tone as she was highly tone on the ...\nAnd own Holly tone yeah anything that is evergreen likes them more acidic soil and Holly tone ... is based for more of an acidic soil type plant\nSo use the holiday tone versus the plant tone on the uh our bodies is going to you're going to notice it's going to be more beneficial for you\nBecause you and I read the when I read the Holly choke package it said you know when I read the plant on packages says for Apple bite each so that's why I said yeah we got all the songs that I'd\nI'd rather you use the Holly telling a to be honest with you I I like the Holly tone on anything that's evergreen Ann Arbor vi these are considered evergreen so I'd like to have that on there to really I'm\nGiven a boost they they like more acidic soils are so by using the Holly telling you can use it at half the rate right now you don't want to put too much in because you don't want to promote growth but in the early spring late winter early spring you can start putting the Holly toned down\nA and that will last for the season just make sure you put everything on the drip line of the plants and it should definitely a work out for you\nOkay beautiful thank you very much it at my wife and I love your program you're doing a great job\nAnd

here today [noise] um my name is Jack Stanton I'm twenty seven years old and I am a lifelong resident of the town of sandwich my family moved to the Cape when I was six years old\nAnd a sandwich has been and always will be home I graduated from high school in two thousand and ten and graduated from the George Washington University's School of international affairs in two thousand and fourteen [noise]\nUm for the past four years or so I've been working in the development sector or health contracts at the world bank group\nAnd most recently was working for research consultancy ah in southern Africa in Mozambique where I did monitoring and evaluation of a program evaluation monitoring a valuation for a NGOs and international organizations\n[noise] um I moved back to Cape Cod this past year and I've been working on an offshore lobster boats out of the sandwich boat basin um I decided to run for office because of a profound frustration with the state of our politics at the national level\nUm I don't think it matters what side of the fence that you sit on but when you look at our political system right now I'm it's profoundly toxic and I'm frustrated in the sense that\nPolitics is something we should not shy away from um the majority of the issues that in fact his all his Cape Cod hers I've found to be a relatively nonpartisan once and I think at the state level um Cape Cod has this perception as this wealthy vacation destination when in reality the folks who live here\nYear round struggle um if you want to live on Cape Cod you're going to work for it [noise] um\nWhen we look at the challenges that are impacting the Cape ah\nI don't see anyone looking fifty to one hundred years down the line with any regard and he sort of vision for the future of this place when it comes to transportation the environment education funding for short changed by the state and all of these areas and I believe that we can do better [noise] um I'm concerned genuinely about the future of this place\nAnd I think it's very very important to get fresh ideas and fresh perspectives injected into our legislature a legislature which takes\nAll the way up until the end up to ... July to pass a budget I'm not content with the way that we are represented up in ... I'm not content with the way that the legislature function\nAnd quite frankly when you look at the composition of the legislature half of the seats have challenges\nI Believe the competition is a good thing I Believe that we need to have representatives that reflects the everyday experiences of those who they represent and ah I'm running to force a conversation about the issues impact all of us here on the Cape so uh I look forward to this exchange and a thanks thanks for providing this form\nNow from Jack Stanton appreciate it first question I have for you ah Randy hunt a congratulations you picked up a local a daily newspaper ah\nEndorsement is just some things though a Randy at the paper said if elected hunt will build on his eight year legacy in the state house offering them measured and in a clear mind\nAnd for whatever it's worth and they were also I I've noticed a letters and phone calls are quite positive a budget so I'm not trying to paint it as there was this avalanche of of negative stuff toward you Randy but there was one fellow that that wrote a letter to the edited got my my my attention\nA fella from sandwich and he said in response to the Cape cod times endorsement of view I fail to see the legacy\nAnd then you're you're challenger over here also wrote a response to the paper and uh\nActually so some kinds of things about it too but then he says I get his record meaning you Randy bears little fruit in terms of actual achievements\nAnd I thought it was interesting Randy to Cape Cod times endorsed you but they didn't actually listening anything ah that would say yeah you know Rand has been there for almost eight years you know one two three here are some real\nYou know this isn't real some some stuff that he managed to bring back home so I wanted to ask you that question and give you a few moments and Jack and respond if you were you and I you know your elevator speech representative of you know Patrick here is you know there's some things I've I've managed to do that I think a pretty significant what would those be Randy\nProbably one of the biggest things that I was involved with was in twenty fourteen when Charlie Baker was running for governor [noise]\nUm I asked for some time with them in a over in his office uh uh just outside of Boston he gave me an hour and a half to ah talk about the issue of the opiate scourge what's going on there\nAt that time Charlie was aware of what was going on no question about that but not deeply involved in it\nUm I brought to him the fact that we had put in a program at the ... county correctional facility a first in the state and something that has sprouted out around the country as well as in foreign countries and that is\nThat inmates there have the opportunity now as they are leaving that a institution to use a medication called Vivitrol which helps to keep them\nFree of the of opiates once they get out back into the real world\nThe sheriff is making contacts with employers making sure people have a safe place to go and making sure that they have that appointment that first thirty day renewal of this um Vivitrol drug Vivitrol is pretty amazing from the standpoint that it helps take away the\nUm the urges to continue you know to do what they had been doing for which usually is the reason they got in trouble so that was one thing that I saw it was interesting and I'd have to hand it to the governor by saying this or he listens\nUm she and I and everybody else in the legislature on take credit for all of this have put together to on the bus bills that have done a great job of a\nTurning back the number of overdose deaths fewer and twenty Seventeen to twenty sixteen and getting rid of fifty percent of the prescribed opiate pills that have been\nUm um that have been a prescribe in twenty Seventeen versus twenty Thirteen were going in the right direction we're the only state in the country that requires the med students have a pain management class and the only state in the country that now requires that for all renewal of licenses\nSo you would list then as a as as your legacy ah a crowning achievement would be that conversation and work you've done on legislation to try to help stem the drug addiction problem\nIdentified that I'm very sad that a ... has showed up and started killing people in a big way but uh\nWe can't quit we have to keep moving and I think that uh we're going to see some good results from all\nOf that we're at a hundred appreciate a ... democratic challenger your response ah to Randy's a giving you some fruit that you said sure I mean he he talked about\nActions at the legislature talking and sort of my response that would be what major funding votes would have ended differently if representative ... we're not there this past eight years and I think that the the legislature has made\nGains that's great but what specifically did you contribute to the passage of major legislation and in this chamber [noise]\nListening to news radio Ninety five W ... morning everybody we're doing a debate between two great guess a Randy hunt a Republican the incumbent and his Democratic challenger Jack Stanton we open up the phone lines now if you have a question for the candidate or both candidates they both get to respond or you may do so now at five away\nIt's seven

responsible obvious that when we\nWent in Grand in your hand on Youth Radio Ninety five WICK ...\n[noise] [noise]\n... news radio Ninety five WICK we appreciate you joining us on\nSundays where in the middle of a debate or for the fifth brunch will state rep race between Randy hunt Republican and his Democratic opponent a Jack Stanton if you're listening and you have a question for the candidates now is a chance if you want you can ask them a question at five oh wait\nSeven seven five W ex T. K. we have the lines open so now is a good time for you to call in and please try to have\nA question I'd like to go back uh we've had a good exchange so far but I like to go back to asking some questions Randy I explained to me [noise] your I'm\nNot supporting or if you will your support seemingly of something called conversion therapy and I admit you Randy my knowledge of converge conversion therapy as only what I've read in a few newspaper articles and I have a feeling it's probably a complex issue\nUh but you did a a not support the ban on it which was before the legislature and the vote was one thirty seven fourteen I Believe I have that right I don't either improper proximate like a vote to to to ban it in and ready I I read a little bit about conversion therapy\nAnd and just lay persons interpretation is if somebody is transgender ring or you know they're they're they're gay this is a therapy that tries to help you undo that and and the and I put it in quotations Randy\nNormal ... didn't strike me as such a good good thing and at ... that just again all a person's interpretation of it so I didn't want to ask you why did you and even the ... the C. C. T. and its endorsement of view they made a point of saying we didn't agree with Randy on this particular vote could you talk to us about\nI'll make it perfectly clear I Am against conversion therapy period\nAnd the bill that we had in front of us was to ban it for minors but I Would say that I'm against it for anybody anybody of any age what it is essentially is a negative stimulation type of therapy\nThat shame ... people that could literally use shocks or to try and get them to change their minds if that would be possible but scientists say that's not\nUm to not be gay or not have a trans gender identity of ah the opposite sex\nGive your allegiance to the speaker of the house and I agree this is not the way it ought to be but asked that Patrick about how well it worked out for him to speak truth to power [noise]\nUm this is the way it is you're either vote with the same color light as the house speaker or you end up being a back venture\nSo you have in the legions to your job there if you want to climb the ladder as well as your constituency for me I have none of that zero\nAll I have to do is declare my allegiance to my constituency and that's it all as a Republican never be a chair vice chair of many of these things are a floor leader any of those types of things but my skills\nSpecifically as a CPA get me into many conversations with people because I'm the go to guy on tax policy\nOne thing though Randy and I think you and I have had this conversation before they'll ah\nAs a Republican in what is clearly I mean this is an understatement it's a democratic bart body with the exception I Know that the governor's office we we voters we we tend to seem to like to put an R. in there but it's a democratic world there\nHow do you respond if someone makes the case directly I think great\nTerrific guy you're a Republican this one over here as a Democrat you just identified the game no one likes but there's a game that goes on up there and if you're with leadership you're a Democrat and as you said if you cooperate with them\nChances are you know you get to see committee assignments maybe your home down on the Cape may be gets a little more attention because you you know the speaker likes you because you've been you've been playing ball what say you about that philosophy about it\n[noise] well it's this I Would challenge anybody to call anybody else in the house of representatives are Democrats and Republicans and asked them about what I bring to the table as a CPA\nAny body will tell you that it's important they rely on things that I Do they invite me to the revenue committee hearings about the uh tax jobs um I mean tax cuts and JOBS Act because that's what I'm about as your party\nAffiliation that that you are a Republican and democratic ...\nYou pointed out that the corner office we sixteen years before Deval Patrick we have Republicans and now we have Republicans again I think Charlie and Karen are going to win\nThe odds of becoming assigned autism having three number one album one and one hundred million [noise] the eyes of going onto in six words Lindy would put four million\nHe wrote a piece in the Boston Globe the in the argument where uh the the argument was posed a is the economic impact of the recent tax bill are going to be positive and it was you and Senator Paul ... who had diverging points of view you would argue that the economic effect of\nThe Trump ... tax on what's going to be net positive um what we're seeing now is we have over nine hundred billion dollar deficit that that\nIs as a direct result of of that tax plan and uh with the salt the auction a loss in in that time\nThe planet actually gonna hurt a lot of families here on the Cape who a benefit from from that a deduction on on\nTheir their taxes every year so I'm as a CPA do you still stand by that reasoning that the economic effect of the tax plan was a net positive for us\nRandy it hasn't been a net positive and you can see it through lots of different measurements or look the state's unemployment rate is a tick below the national unemployment rate which is the best that it has been in a long long time I said my opponent confuses\nThe national debt with economic um prosperity um these two things have a um they have a relationship but not a direct relationship\nAs we get through this year and into next year's tax season\nAnd people start paying you know the rest of what they owe 'em what they're going to find is they're going to be better off than they were a before the tax cut in JOBS Act here's what I Know\nEvery year my a practice we have um about two hundred and twenty five tax returns that go through and I visit with at least three hundred people during that time I have an added to that practice since twenty tent so the you know we have a few new customers in a few that disappeared\nAnd in that here's what I Know about people on Cape Cod 'cause every single one of those two hundred and twenty five or right from here [noise]\nNinety five percent of my clients that I projected what twenty Seventeen would have looked like had been under the new tax rules which are in place in twenty Eighteen or are going to do better\nI don't do millionaires and billionaires I'd do middle class people retired people um and I have a few\nThat it's going to be worse\nBut out of those few every single one of them makes more than four hundred thousand dollars a year so I can tell you from facts and all of these clients that I have that they'll do better in twenty Eighteen than before\nNow the other part of the equation is we'll all of the stimulus that we've seen and we've seen\nThat happening across the country\nActually bring in taxes in the form of payroll taxes and other taxes on corporations and all\nThat will overcome what the tax cuts are that's up for debate I don't know that that's going to be the case but I hundred percent stand behind what I said in the Boston Globe because I have the personal experience of knowing that it is true\nAh jak response yeah I I so I\nKnocked on plenty of doors and this has come up frequently up the doors and there's a lot of people who are have discussed the fact that losing the salt adoption is actually on their taxes go up seeing as you know\nWe're a high tax state we pay high property taxes we pay state taxes and we're moving that deduction is is a significant harm to them in addition and when we have Seventy percent of economic growth contingent on consumer spending\nOr the majority of that comes from middle income and lower income people and so I don't know why we're giving tax relief to the top one percent of the population that is when when they get\nAccess gains it goes to goes to\nIncreased dividends to them they they they find more ways to make money off of their money I Would love to have a conversation about tax relief or you know the regular guy who's who's working hard\nUm but I don't think that the the ah economic effect of of this tax plan and a is what was predicted that's why we're seeing these enormous federal deficits\nAnd ah I\nIt just makes no sense to me to defend that sort of an argument and now we're talking about making cuts to Social Security and Medicare because we're not going ... we had these deficits that were created by\nA tax plan which does not uh\nCreate the net necessary economic growth which would have paid for the last word for you Randy ...\nA well let me explain about the top one percent of the people that pay 'em the top ten percent pay well over half of the um\nThe income taxes that are paid at the federal level and so when you have a rate roll back the people that paid the biggest amount of taxes get the biggest effect of that rate rolled back this is not something that you need to go to college to figure out\nThe people that pay over fifty percent of the taxes are going to get the most benefit from it this is what has ignored by this talking points\nAnd I'll tell you this knocking on a few doors and having people comment on this that's one thing I have two hundred and twenty five people in a database that is significant statistically for this area saying that this is something that is going to help\nOr not hurts the people that are in this ... district\nAnd let's hope it's a good great great question you came up with jak but because of time or let's give Randy Honda or an opportunity to ask you a question Randy [noise] so\nUm\nJak you are a young guy I get that um you're twenty seven my youngest is twenty nine\nAnd I'm going to uh just ask you to comment on this uh I'm sure that your parents um our role models for you that you're proud of them I met her dad the you know a few weeks ago and he is like super proud it'd be there's no question about that [noise]\nAnd so I just wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about that and how they've been influential in your life\nUm I appreciate that my family is is banned my back on 'em they they move to Cape Cod a to create a a good environment where I could grow up and [noise]\nThey've given me just about everything but the shirt off their back\nAt every point in my life where I've needed help where I was down where\nI needed support they've they've had my back and continue to an end to this day and my parents are huge inspiration for me to a huge role models and um you know I have a profound amount of of respect for them because family is important for them\nAnd they'll do anything for the kids and uh I think those are those are values that I share their values that I'm sure you you have in in your family as well it's up to the base of it all so\nI find that an interesting question Mr hunt that you asked a a jak good question could question\nLet's I give you another round want to grab a call or two first just to break it up is that okay with both of you who can do that and see what the general public ah is saying out there five all eight seven seven five W ... we go to born in ... and your question for the candidates\nHey good morning I just wanted a date that while I don't know Jack got like and all that I guy I'm I've known Randy in the mid nineties had the opportunity to do business and when he was the chief financial officer over an arrow by that\nAnd I know that Randy than really upstanding guy or the representation\nAttack here in the ... district and I you know I put my support behind Randy I eat\nAnd very kind or my daughter and I and he's always been responsive to me when I had any sort of issues and uh it was kind enough to give it a great tour of the day as a couple of years ago when we were up there so [noise] brand do you have my vote and I want to call in and that guy had a great\nDay and I think that the caller's could try to have questions for the candidates ah I I certainly would appreciate that uh Peter joined says Hey Peter and good morning you're an ex decay you're on with a ... jak stand go right ahead\nGood morning wanting jak and ready on and watch the morning questions for a\nWay on the Cape shovel almost one billion dollars a year into the Cape coffers thanks to our you name it sales taxes room taxes\nAnd we continue only get the short end of the stick\nWhy should we put another Democrat into a Democrat controlled legislature which used the Cape as a cookie jar\n[noise] jak then [noise] I think that\nA first of all\nI consider myself a Cape Cod her first Senate Democrat second I kind of really look past the label to Cape delegation is a good job working together [noise] um the issues that I'm focused on or nonpartisan a nature I I don't think the label matters where the label does matter is that Democrats control\n[noise] I Do not have all the answers and running for this I've said this repeatedly however I think the biggest qualifications one needs to have in order to be someone representing their community is to have an understanding of the challenges that everyday people face in that community and I believe\nI can be that person the seat as a public trust it doesn't belong to everyone every two years people have the opportunity to choose who is going to advocate on their behalf up on it can help as someone who has a background in resource management and research can research consulting I have an understanding\nOf how to allocate resources effectively and to ensure that we have our tax dollars spent as someone who has lived studied and worked all of the world I have a capacity to work with people of different backgrounds understand what we're others come from\nDifferent experiences and to be able to work with folks all across the spectrum to get things done I have a deep amount of commitment to this region I moved back here because I Love Cape Cod I Love my home and I want to live here\nIf I lose this election I Will still be here because this is my home and I will continue plugging along to make this community\nUp a better place I'm I'm asking for your vote because I Believe that there is something to be said for new energy and a fresh perspective at the legislature\nThey consider Cape Cod to be a wealthy vacation destination and it is not there are significant challenges here on the Cape and I want to be a jolt of energy and his stride an advocate for this class that I call home\nAnd if I'm given the opportunity to do so I'll be tireless and representing the forty two thousand people of this district fulltime on it can help ah and with that said I ask for your vote on November ... Jack Stanton thanks closing by Randy hunt Randy\nAgain I think your path for putting this debate together I trust your listeners have been able to draw a contrast between my positions experience and details behind the issues versus my opponents general statements in allegiance the most progressive liberal ideas one could have\nMy opponent supports sanctuary cities as we mentioned in a sanctuary state which would protect and shield convicted criminals who were illegally in the United states from being detained in process\nFor deportation by immigration and Customs Enforcement my opponent endorsed the most irresponsible version of single payer health care ever conceived called Medicare for all\nIt's a system that the more data center concluded would cost us conservatively thirty two trillion dollars over ten years\nPaying hospitals and doctors at Medicare rates which are generally forty percent less than private payer raids would ensure the closure of more than thirty hospitals in Massachusetts\nDrive many of our best doctors out of practice and make a wreck of the Medicare system that almost every one sixty five and older talent on\nI asked the voters reelect me Randy ...

experience when dealing with the budget and legislation at the state level our house speaker Robert ... was a member of the select board and Winthrop\nGovernor Charlie Baker and lieutenant governor Karen Alito also served on their towns select boards to skip any kind of local service whether appointed or elected is in my opinion not a formula for success\nI trust that the voters in the Bronx will district to understand how important experience and solid relationships with my colleagues in the house Senate and administration are\nAnd I asked for your vote on Tuesday November six thank
