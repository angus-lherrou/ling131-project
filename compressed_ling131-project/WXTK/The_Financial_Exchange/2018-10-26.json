in the back but they're letting him through and I know it doesn't matter whether they come to this border or not they'll kick him out just because of the fact they haven't gone through the due process is only\nWe can we can't according to the laws that are on the book Shane right now and it does get confusing we will offer someone asylum into this country with a hearing in front of a judge to for

to they're going to come out and talk about the fake bombs and they'll find out who did it [noise]\nAh and all sorts of different things campaigns are still going strong and we'll see um Monday to let's go next week so last week I met labor to have a great weekend\nWe argue Cape Cod local news authorities tells us TK west you're most Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan to more suspicious packages discovered today in the investigation into possible explosive devices being set out one addressed a former director of national intelligence James Clapper found in New York the other down in Florida authorities recovered a\nIf you're talking about the the ability of U.S companies to export goods from the U.S come tougher this year because the dollars up that's the number one if you're a company based in the U. S. that trying to export to other countries\nYou're not investing in exports to begin with because the dollar stronger and then also you're sitting there saying gee I've got these tariffs that are out there that are looming and I don't know what the situation is on that front or and so that's a concern if you're a business owner as well so I think those are major contributors to this\nThe dollar issue might go away but it's something that could get a little bit worse before it gets better there\nUm and the other thing to keep in mind on this uh GDP report here is you know one thing that may reverse itself and that may you know make the fourth quarter look a little bit better we did see a spike in imports in this quarter with a lot of companies trying to import goods before tariffs went into effect\nSo that is something that did create a little bit more drag in this quarter here and that could reverse itself and maybe you know companies say okay now we need to source more domestically and you could get a bounce back in that business fixed investment number but it's something that you know it's if it's a concern just because we haven't seen this in two plus years now\nAnd it's it's just unusual to see a decline like that from where we were\nI have concerns about it but I'm going to take the optimistic view and I think I'm going to say that going through the end of the year here we're going to have consumer spending pick up to a level that maybe it reverses this business trend that\nWe will see maybe it maybe I'm wrong about this but I think that consumer spending especially through the end of this year and starting through next year I think may pick up the slack of what we're seeing on the drop in business investment\nThe third quarter GDP in at three point five percent little better than expected Mike's but what how would you describe yourself cautiously optimistic is that a fair\nAnd just only because I hear\nEveryone you know you're calling for you and we're right in the middle of big market volatility and I hear everyone around calling for a recession and I just don't see it so I don't think this this GDP report does anything to tell me that we are headed imminently towards recession I Do get concerned about decreases in business spending but that can reverse quickly\nMike cautiously optimistic Chuck more cautiously pessimistic ... will go from there let's talk about a couple of companies that reported earnings after the bell yesterday there both tech companies\nAmazon and alphabet both reporting\nA and both down significantly today after reporting Amazon now off about eight point five percent right now alphabet stock currently off about four point eight percent so both down notes north of four percent in both times with similar as you're not the exact same but similar issues and that\nRevenues a little bit weaker than expected and margins being pressured\nYeah unfortunately for Google they've got the that combined with a lot of regulatory issues that Amazon is currently are facing right now so that's been a bit of a combined whack against their stock price today and you can take a look at you know you can look at the chart and see that they've been under combined pressure there um you know and Amazon's case\nIt's just a story of ... and maybe this is just to you know one quarter type of issue but it seems to be a story of they can't continue to grow with the rates that they've grown up forever\nAnd perhaps expectations were just a little bit too lofty here for this company so they saw profit that we're in line but revenue drops that we're a little bit of a surprise\nUh pretty much across the board you know even the Amazon Web services division which has been the you know profit center for the whole company over the last few years even that you know it didn't shrink but it's a slow down as they saw more competition coming out of Google and Microsoft\nYeah ... and certainly I think both of these companies you know one of the big questions that I think a lot of investors tend to have his look you know Amazon has been so good for so long one and I just put my whole portfolio into that company\nWell it's because they're not based on what they're doing today they're based on projections of growth Ryan ... and so forth and that's why you see in a time where by the way the S P five hundred just entered into correction territory meaning a it is more than ten percent off\nA of it's a lot of it's all time high now Kamber that Amazon right now is down twenty percent okay from its high of just over two thousand fifty dollars a share\nSo the risk with a company like Amazon you take on because the valuation so lofty there's more room for it to follow it has fallen since the start of October about twice as much as the rest of the market sure\nYeah absolutely and if you if you were one of those that bought back in September you're almost you know definitely kicking yourself a little bit here\nUm I bought last week and I'm Still kicking myself a little bit so you know that's not to say that there isn't room for reversal here with Amazon but they have been just the darling of the stock market for the last decade and this is a little bit of a cooling down period for them let's call it for we hit the\nBrake was also talk a little bit on ... earnings their sales increasing on higher prices they're able to push through some higher commodity cost or to their uh their customers there what do you make of this quarter for ...\nUm one I haven't seen anything in the news recently about a mass groups of people getting horribly sick from eating their food is good you know as long as they can do that quarter after quarter that's great\nThat big number that I saw that I

companies insofar as they are managing to extract a little bit more revenue and profit from their users but their growth of daily actor users is declining as\nSo it may actually Snapchat side decline that drop and daily active users\nAh they expect to continue losing some customers but they are are delivering a little bit more revenue from those customers that they have but at the end of the day you've got a a sinking ship here or potentially if they continue to lose customers unless they find a way to get them back\nSo that's what Wall Street cares about they're not terribly interested in the profit numbers the revenue numbers they want to see what those daily active users are doing and therefore stock is off nearly Fifteen Percent right now\nWith a lot of these social media networks there's a lot of chatter that oh you know this app redesign didn't work or that one didn't know these speech\nHow much of this is just people hate these things now I don't know if anyone ever say gee

right let's talk a little bit about uh the plan that the president is proposing try to lower Medicare drug costs wouldn't what are we seeing here Mike\nWhat we've been talking about this since President Trump took office and it looks like he's putting together a plan the\nIdea behind it is that right now the United states most people I think are recognized as the United states on average\nPays considerably more for prescription drugs than the rest of the world as the rest of world specifically Europe puts a very specific price controls a on drug makers if they want to sell their drugs in their countries\nAnd therefore the United states end up end up paying a lot more and ended up driving a lot of the research and development that gets done on these the idea here\nIs that President Trump is proposing a plan where they would create an index of\nInternational costs for drug prices and then Medicare would be required to negotiate down to that price so two things could happen here either the drug companies would have to raise prices and the foreign countries to get that index price higher get asked that they could charge more in the United states or more likely\nUnited States prices come down a little bit and international prices go up a little bit to offset that this isn't\nIt is this playing being imposed on every drug that's out\nThere it is not there is a specially it just seems like a little bit of a beta testing so they're going to do it for just a few different prescriptions that Medicare has\nA certain drugs made by a single manufacture and those known as biologics or those made from living organisms and it's gonna be going from twenty twenty to twenty twenty five is where they're going to be experimenting on this um\nIt seems to be a worthwhile seems very worthwhile endeavor I mean one of the biggest complaints that I have is Medicare basically can't negotiate a price I Know that that's built into their rules for well really because that was the only way they could get to the Affordable CARE Act passed through all the money that the pharmaceuticals wearing a gifts so\nThis is a big issue I don't know if this will solve the issue but it seems on the surface like it would be a worthwhile endeavor the drug industry by the way going to be fighting this being mentally or there's gonna be a lot of money spent on getting Congress to shut this down\n[noise] going back to social media also are we still have Twitter report or their earnings are late yesterday they are taking the opposite path or Snapchat they're up over ... over fifty percent in\nYou know it's a three minute message that I Know I just tell me pick up now everyone acts good everyone's grade I I can get attacked by\nAnyways the U.S and China haven't really heard of people on trade talks in the last couple of weeks here any sense that things are moving behind the scenes or still kind of some hang ups to just getting to the table and less they are being\nIncredibly sneaky about it it seems like things are just completely stalled out right now are there is the hope to have a meeting scheduled right now for the end of November at the G ... summit\nI'm looking potentially unlikely that that even happens the U.S is basically refused to resume and then go ... and tell Beijing comes out with a proposal to Washington that addresses the complaints about forced technology transfer and quote other economic issues\nI Believe there's a whole list of some hundred and sixty seven hundred and forty two separate demands at the U.S has put in\nAnd um China's just hesitant to put out anything from ... to be fair one I think we're probably taking the right tactic here which is just don't even begin negotiations until they come up and give you something\nUm but China on the other hand is saying if we put out anything than we are fears is going to get linked to the press and then we're going to come from a week ago she ate and point\nBy the way some some data on you know how companies are mentioning in responding to tears this is according to Bloomberg uh in the course over the course of twenty eight team the number of companies that are mentioning tariffs are the number of transcripts that have mentioned them over the course of the year so far\nTwenty one hundred and eighty eight if you go back to last year we didn't get above seven hundred even listen ... you're talking you're three times as much activity on the side as last\nYear do you feel like it's just being used as an excuse for companies no no you think it's going to miss you\nKnow I I I again just from talking to people in the construction industry and what's happened to prices on that side for steel and aluminum yeah it's it's it's a real issue there um as far as you know can can you get projects done at certain prices\nUm and that's just in one industry there's definitely some businesses that are using it as an excuse you know I I always hate when companies you know used you know oh we had bad weather and so like we write like\nGrow up with a ... cheesecake factory don't blame you are terrible sales on bad weather here\nImprove your product improve your product but you know damn good things like this real like you know whether I sit there and go look there's always whether they're always hurricanes there's always snow yep you figure out how to deal with it OK stuff like this these the kinds of things have there aren't always terrorists that are coming into effect right so these are things that I Do think have a more meaningful ...\nWhere would you put if you're a gay man where would you put the likelihood the odds of anything getting done on trade with China like a concrete plan before and then this year twelve percent cut yeah I'm Down there\nVery very unlike not Thirteen not eleven but those weren't on but that's OK twelve percent I I don't understand odds what I wanted I'd had you know a different story\nAb ... the big beer maker or they make Budweiser that they make just about every ... uh yeah I'm just so they are struggling and they actually cut their dividend in half\nThat they're not strong I mean when you got your ... and half that's a pretty big message or sending\nSo here's the thing they bought SAP Miller when was it two years ago maybe three three three years ago the exact wrong time to ...\nUh you know it's awful climbing\nThe exact wrong time to make that deal and they're paying for it now why they're cutting their dividends they took on so much debt to make that deal and consumers taste of changed\nYou know I I think back to three years ago and you know I already thought that at that point the craft beer market was you know really getting crazy and wild and sort of peaking and it has gotten so much bigger since that three year ago and they just continue to take market share away from Budweiser\nAnd I'll tell you the latest ads where they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers or are they have you seen these you know\nIt's the ones where they've got the guys you know the ... and you go into a ... for everyone in someone's going oh do you ever meet ah yeah they're they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers yeah ... ... there's not a good way to get people to come back to what product\nBut I mean the Bud Light can make fun of the craft drinkers all they want but then on the other side of it they're coming out with these Budweiser products you know a Budweiser freedom reserve red blogger\nIs one of them and they came out recently and the bottles and one of the army and yet I'm In Maryland barrel I mean so their knowledge and the fact that they need to change it up and be more creative with their beer not working no it's not it's it ... you can make fun of it and then do the same thing the other side of it you can have it both ways\nConsumer see through that stuff these days and so a be in the stock has gone from a hundred and twelve down to Seventy three it's all fifty percent this thirty percent this year [noise] you know it's a big dip in a pretty short period of time this stock if you go back to two years to the end of September and twenty sixteen\nWas one thirty a share switch off almost fifty percent in a span of two years\nAnd it's by the way it's not just um you know just people saying I Want to craft beer over a Budweiser there's also a big big trend towards liquor and wind that or did not exist in previous generations spirits are on the up enough\nSpirits big time wind to a lesser degree but spirits are very much so much more demand for that type of specific alcohol than ah than beer at well\nThe thing that's missing with Budweiser is that these breweries have become a destination and hang out in a ... a day trip for most people our age\nYeah they got they got no experience from Budd while you go to any of these crappy ones that got food trucks there they might have local artists in good hands and stuff\nIs maybe end up doing anything to get into the marijuana industry you know you see constellation brands are really making some strides there I haven't really heard of a be doing anything\nHaven't heard of ... doesn't mean they're not working you know kind of in the background and maybe have say I'm coming but I've heard a whole lot there\nNeither well that is all the time we have on this hour the Dow continues to struggle S P a negative territory now in correction territory off more than ten percent from its high so all the time we have on this hour we'll be back in just a little bit with more financial exchange [laughter]\nThe\nProceedings a pain for advertising by the financial exchange it does not reflect the views court opinions of the station its advertisers or I heart media [noise]\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan two more package is much like the ones containing suspected explosive devices have been discovered today details from ABC is Aaron ...\nThis ... when this when does dip first started back a couple of weeks ago you know a lot of people were ... kind of similar myself included I remarked hey this feels kind of similar to what we saw earlier this year\nSince then I I've kind of moved off that 'cause we've got an economic data that suggests hey we've got you know real slow down the housing that's coming this for this third quarter GDP report had some questions where do you stand as far as not necessarily how bad this could get because again we're not trying to make predictions here 'cause neither of us know\nWhat do you get the sense this thing is a quick tip like we saw in the spring or do you get to get the census might linger a little bit even if you don't know exactly where it goes\nYou know I still draw a lot of correlations back to what we saw in February and I like you don't make myself in the business of productions but\nI can see a few instances where you could see a rally of this coming back rather quickly if you if you get the midterms behind you and all of a sudden you see a very strong consumer spending towards the end of the year\nTo me that would be an indication that things are gonna recover rather quickly or but it could go the other way to hey I I hate to jump in here and try and lay claim is or where I think the stock market's going to go\nOver the next sixty days because nobody knows\nAnd and I think the the big thing isn't so much trying to say hey here's where it's going to go but hey what what's important to watching it and I booked\nHey anything housing related ... you have to be watching that because that's one of the concerns right now the focus on housing focus on some of the big you know kind of existential questions what's going on with trade negotiations going on in Europe with uh the Italian\nIn their ability to get a budget passed you know those are the things that you need to be asking yourself hey what kind of progress are we seeing and I think when you start to get some of those answers we can get more clarity but for now if you have to find a path to a quick bounce back for me but it said any of these things resolved themselves and you might see that'd be the impetus\nYeah by the way you know I Know a lot of people looking at elections and saying oh that's going to be a huge thing that kept the markets one way or the other I Would really discouraged you to putting putting too much stock into politics and how they impact the stock market because if you look at history hasn't matter one bit who wins in terms of how the stock market reacts not one bit\nExpedia trying to make some moves in to be in bees turf what are they talking about doing here my\nThere's a couple of companies that they have recently acquired and they're specifically that they do pretty much the same thing as air BNB but what they try and do is have a better relationship with the people that actually own the places that are getting rented out so one of the big issue that they identified as people that are\nLeasing an apartment and then sub letting it out on the air being be and that that creates issues for the owners they don't want that it can create issues for the condo association there can be rules against that sort of thing\nSo what this service uh the one company called pillow in one called apartment jet where\nThey specifically contract with both the lease holder as well as the owner of the unit to make sure that you know the owner knows who's going to be in the apartment and are a number of different factors to make it just a little bit more secure in the way that they're renting this out\n[noise] do you think this makes what one of the questions that I I've raised with regards to air being the is you're seeing ... he's pushing back on either setting limits are saying hey you can't do this do you think this helps to square away some of those problems and maybe make this a more\nUm you know not favorable but I guess a more\nReasonable landscape for companies similar to European beat operating\nAnd to be fair to air BNB they've taken some pretty big moves to make things a little bit safer and make things more [noise]\nI guess I compliant with local jurisdictions term they're clocking collecting taxes and things have gone does nature that they weren't doing initially so I think every NBA themselves are doing a pretty good job but these are some new start ups that could make a big dent\nFor those specific types of situations where you're looking for more security around how you're renting at your

school students using e cigarettes has surged Seventy seven percent this year\nAnd so the FDA said you need to change you need to address this and then we're going to look at what you do and we're going to determine whether it's good enough or not\nAll tree or you know you cigarettes make up less than one percent of their sales so they've come out and I think what they're doing here they're saying hey we're going to be the most conservative in the industry and that's going to put all the pressure\nOn these other smaller companies like Jewell who make who is the rest makes up their entire business all they do all they do so all tree is putting a stake in the ground and saying hey we're willing to become way more conservative here\nAnd then the other ones are gonna be pressured to come

entire twelve person boarded Campbell Soup not just ... feet or pick up a couple here and there they want to replace the entire twelve person board\nFirst question is why second question is what's going on\nWell they're alleging that Campbell's you failed to disclose or disclose them you know it's misleading information about their business and my guess here is or points coming out with a very you know forceful a strong point here and then it's going to back off a little bit and but they're probably going to get a few boards it's over this would be my guess\nWhy does third point want to control Campbell Soup and\nPresumably you get in there and you cut costs across the board and that that's generally what hedge funds to do a maybe a look at a sale\nEven though this is the stock that's down you know almost fifty percent in the last two and a half years no one's boss not no one's buying can't people are still buying Campbell Soup they still have sales obviously yeah\nBut they're really struggling to make kind of inroads in a market where people are buying the same types of food products they weren't even just a year or two ago right it you know we've seen dramatic changes there\nI think that's their points entire point though is they're saying hey look okay you're you're bored and you're management has claimed they don't address changing consumer behavior is you need somebody from the outside to come in and change the company uh and that's probably a third points you know idea here\nI think that this could be a pretty good and easy sale to a company like craft times okay to something along those lines yeah I mean I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen but it would seem like they were pretty easily fit into that business model\nI Will say you know look I'm I'm not a big Campbell Soup fan in general but there's something about their tomato soup on a on a cold winters day with a little grilled cheese dipped in it that it it it's there's just
