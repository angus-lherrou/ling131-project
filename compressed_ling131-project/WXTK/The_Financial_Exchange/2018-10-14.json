{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Um and actually the same year I was back during doing workshops\nWow this is and then you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or ... or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has been thought of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're\nNon mall over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there was a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... when you are when people are going to be travels the painted he mapped the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have\nConsciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up\nMind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively\nFor instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to remind me\nOf a mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In uh in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are your most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with\nSarah herself with are multi dimensional so right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional then it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nWhere there was an operation of how they ran a bed and breakfast okay right and it ended up causing problems when it came time to applying for Medicaid that they wouldn't have thought about ... when they're just going through their day to day business sure right so single person writes a heading into the nursing home\nSun comes in son's been really running the business\nAs of late so maybe over the last six months\nAnd it's a it's a bed and breakfast type place where it's about eight hundred grand in a house in South Carolina where it's about eight hundred grand in a hundred and sixty grand in the bank okay\nShe's now back up here in mass and she's going to go into nursing home and mess mhm\n... what can we do what's the situation here well I started asking questions and say well here's what we can do you wouldn't think about this is this something you can get eligible for Medicaid last minute with these kinds of assets adds a lot you can the answer is absolutely yes how one of the business property right that's a business\nSo it's a rental type kind of place right it's a bed and breakfast\nIt's non accountable because it's generating in Comedy Central to self support so we have a provision regulation that allows that to be non accountable so we take eight hundred thousand off the table\nWould that be true if it were just a straight business Todd and not a rental property type situation\nI think so okay yes I Do I Will comes off the table now they're going to put a lean on it mhm that's OK the liens always your friend because it's going to be at a much lower Medicaid rate than the private pay rate for the nursing home mhm way lower some like fourteen Fifteen thousand a month down to six\nPlus you get to use the net rent\nTo maintain the property right so you get tips you get you get the rent to maintain the property and it's the ... rent that you give the nurse so after all your expenses that's ... and even that that rent along with your Social Security all goes towards reducing\nThe amount of money that the state would be paying so that lean every month is smaller clean get smaller Zachary ... okay\nSo I've got the business of property off the table [noise]\nWhat about the south Carolina property normally that was her home\nWell homes or non cannibal for single people\nUnless they're not located in the state oh remember that they have to be located in the state so that's the first issue but then I find out for single people if you move out of the house you can treat it as a former home\nAnd then the former home requirement does not require you to be living in the state ... it just says it has to be the former home and doesn't say where it has to be located flu so long so now I Believe that's South Carolina property will be protected from the nursing home and\nNot even sure they can put a lean on it because it's out of state there's some gray area as to whether or not and\nMassachusetts or any state can lean out of state property interesting so at least we know the south Carolina property would be non accountable because we were checked the box that it's her home it's a former residents and she intends to return home even if she can't ... wonderful so the ... so there's a million six\nOff the table already [noise] we got a hundred and sixty thousand and cash yeah he can only have two thousand 'cause she's single it's exactly right Susan so we're stuck with the two thousand or how do we get rid of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars we can either buying annuity or use a pool trust mhm\nProbably depending on her age will take the money and put it into a pool trust might\nBe easier um and and I would do that if I Would probably only do the pull trust if\nThe annuity doesn't work number wise meaning she's probably over Ninety so let's say she's eighty five I might do a ... I might do an annuity mhm go out by him medicated annuity convert the asset into an income stream and she'll receive a monthly check\nAnd now that a hundred and fifty thousand is no longer an asset preventing her from becoming eligible for Medicaid but\nInstead ... was converted by buying the annuity into an income stream for her\nNow we've got her on Medicaid or there'll be willing to pay back actually but so what\nI might not through the public trust because the pool trust while it also would protect the money it not only has the pay back but it also has that little charitable piece that you got to pay ... depending on how long you live there either twenty percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home more than two years\nOr ten percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home less than two years so I should say two years or more you pay twenty\nLess than two years you pay ten so you don't have the charity piece what the pay back on the annuity mhm so that's the difference between those two so now you see we actually can get this person eligible for Medicaid that all sounds great right\nExcept what I saw going on in the bank accounts for the business\nA lot of times the people that would work there would want to be paid in cash oh so there's withdrawals for cash checks to pay the cash and ... and then she would pay the cash well\nAlso there would be checks to cash or checks written to the son\nWho's actually working there and done plumbing the opening the closing but if it's a check from your bank account which really was just in her name yet to the sun that's going to look like a gift\nAnd now you're going to have to prove that all these transfers we're actually not gifts mhm you might be able to prove it you might not be able to so\nBe careful how you operate it you're going to pay somebody to give them a W to write the check from the company you know show that it's reported on their income tax return show that they work there these are things to think about\nOperationally now having said all that I Am going to just give you this last thought if they had done all of this and put it into these trust in advance the house and the vacate or the house and the rental property would already be protected ...

they blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan ... hours\nOf a few questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Phil in Dorchester math and Phil writes my wife recently passed away unexpectedly\nWe were in the process of drawing up our trust but we never got to execute them before she died is there anything that can be done now to save our state a state tax exemptions we were worth around one point eight million when she passed what are you guys give us\nA magic wand why we do planning and they were actually in their defense they were in the process of doing it true true true and and this is a\nReally a great story in the sense that that it can it can really help us understand how not planning is harmful mhm right so if you have one point eight million and you were successful at setting up to trust\nOr say to irrevocably trust that could be one replicable either way or that has the marital sharing the remainder share built in what that means is it's it's easier to explain what to trust say way I put\nSet point nine hundred thousand dollars of assets in one trust and nine hundred thousand and another trust mhm when the first spouse in this case died say the wife if she had done the planning right\nThere'd be nine hundred thousand dollars in her trust whether it's revolt couple are irrevocably is irrelevant mhm what matters is there's two buckets that form inside her trust\nPeople need to realize that this trust doesn't fold up and go away and everything flows out into the spouses our hands you know the whole point of the trust is that it does not die mhm it keeps on going\nAnd we then take the nine hundred thousand dollars of stuff that's in the trust\nAnd allocated to a share called the remainder share or to the marital share of the trust so romaine or the bypass shared gets the amount of assets up to the state exemption mhm a million in Massachusetts yeah or your state exemption\nAnd the amount over that\nCan go to the marital share in the marrow share allows us to make tax elections which I don't need to get into right now because in this case there's nine hundred and the nine hundred would end up in the remainder share for the benefit of the surviving spouse mhm\nAnd because of the way that remainder share is drafted you would end up having those assets not just flowing into the hands of the healthy spouse but there for the healthy spouses benefit yup or surviving now ... right\nBut she doesn't own it and so she doesn't own it if the surviving spouse doesn't own it\nThen when the surviving spouse dies it's not taxable what if it grows though what if they're hurt his trust grows to be twice as that\nDoesn't matter never doesn't matter how much it grows it will never be whatever's left in there when the surviving spouse dies is not owned by the surviving spouses therefore not taxable and the surviving spouses estate\nBut because of that it would have been caused to be taxed in the\nFirst spouse to dies estate\nBut it's nine hundred thousand you said hey we got a formula built in there that says hey the amount up to the exemption goes in this bucket mhm oh look it's less than a million\nSo while it's subject to tax in the first spouses estate to die ... there's an exemption to use it up\nSo we file a tax return but we don't have to pay taxes good question and the answer is no if it's less than the million dollar filing threshold I don't even need to file nice the estate tax return\nAnd there's no tax too so what about those folks that didn't get around to doing their planning we know federally you can use portability but is that available in the state can we do not available in this state\nSo you lose that and just to play out the string what happens right because if you follow the string I just did with the planning ...\nNo tax on the first F less than a million\nSurviving spouse dies I said there's nine hundred thousand in her trust ... less than a million no tax yep period\nThis way because no planning was done everything will likely went to the surviving spouse mhm [noise] surviving spouses now worth one point eight million which again this is why the marital deduction is so beneficial for the government not for us right it pumps up the surviving spouse as a state\nWith the deceased spouse disaster mhm so now she's at one point eight million which is greater than the million dollar exemption so when she dies there is about an eighty thousand dollar Massachusetts a state tax liability do anything to be done with that now\nI Can't think of anything I assume they just have simple wills that leave everything you each other so if they have simple wells that leave everything to each other the only thing you can really do at this point would be file a disclaimer saying treat me surviving spouse as if I died\nAnd then everything would go ... that was going to come to me would go to my kids but now it's not but now you don't have the spout right while you might be able to I don't necessarily think I like the result of that\nAnd you know folks failed clearly they put off they're planning a little too long I Know that his wife passed unexpectedly but get your planning in place folks there's so many benefits they can come from that and if you're concerned not just about estate taxes and bloodline cleaning and boating probate\nMaybe you're concerned about depleting those assets impoverishing your spouse if you go into a nursing home\nFind out how these eerie vocal tries to operate find out the information that absolutely must be

quick question a lot like asking and they send out the coating on the grass seed virtually impossible at science brass said without this coating on it I called yesterday to find out uh as much as I could and they said to uh keep it away for a live\nA sitter Turkey's eating wild turkeys it'd be livestock and they eat just about everything you know what my opinion day\nNow as there are ... and there are some seeds that shouldn't have it um you know it when you say the coding and you're talking about the coating that they use for a to keep the moisture so it's like a less watering\nA yes okay\nIs one of things you can do [noise] um when I was like you know\nThere's a possibility is up putting the the grass seed in like some sort of shaker like a Tumblr type thing um and and shaking it and trying to ... you know scratch as much as you can\nAnd off of it by doing that so they're they're rubbing into each other and scratching each other so there's not as much [noise]\nUm the other thing you could be doing if you're putting down grass eating certain areas um you could use there is like a frost blanket that is it as a complete coverings of grass seed\nThat you could put down so that a wildlife such as Turkey's wouldn't be a picking at it they wouldn't have the easiest visibility to get it\nI'm going to be covered it would keep to the ground at that temperature for the next couple of weeks you'll notice that some of the you know you'll have to take a look at it every couple of days it usually takes about seven to fourteen days depending upon the grass seed that you used to Germany\nAnd when it starts to pop up that's when you know you would lift that blank it up so you're not covering the the soil I'm so that it can actually get some of the sun photosynthesis that type of thing it'll get the sun 'cause usually like a white\nBlanket type covering but that might be your safest way to do it and it\nIt would it be detrimental to the U.S some birds\n[noise] well I don't care I don't think it would I mean there are scenes out there that you should be able to use like bone I'd has some great seed um that I don't believe has a coating like that uh you can also get a natural alternative also has some grass seed you could use\nA I don't believe they have a coating on there's either no hope at a coating it sounds like a great advancement to it but it's not really necessary\nIn my opinion I agree a secret definitely take a look at that the other thing you could do with that Tom Lehrer say you were to put it in a jar and spin it adds some sand in there or like small little ... and they're so ads like some grit to scratch it\nUm if that will you know if you're already bought the seat and you're trying to get rid of it that type of thing that might work it's really as now getting by it okay yeah I mean to be honest I I personally wouldn't [noise]\nUm for like I Know what you which brand you're talking about um but I wouldn't I wouldn't use that one a bone it has a grape seed and likes to natural alternatives has some great feed a great thing about natural eternity of if you do call them and you talk about what you're looking to to get\nBill actually give you a lot of information their company that wants to hear from you it isn't going to do their fertilizer yeah well ...\n\nYeah so they do have grass seed as well um so they might fall behind me some really good stuff too so so definitely try a try them their uh their their Monday through friday or you could you could try on Monday and see what you can guarantee that\nOkay Patrick thank you very very much and there's a chance of getting a mailing address like nail on your mom's photos from Cuba\nOkay if you go on to the website and all the way the bottom to contact us that'll come right

confirmation a of a Supreme Court justice I think stir it up even more so a lot of Republicans around the country\nSo we shall see on November six whether you get a lot of people coming out and and they just decide to just blindly perhaps vote democratically and the Steven lead the words of the world's could find that that's in a huge way uh to their uh advantage and then on November\n\nSorry everybody and I'm right in front of a November fourth\nRight before the election this is another good one ah we've got a couple of um [noise] um [noise]\nA couple of a strong candidates or that will uh will\nBe in here uh debating and that's the point of um [noise]\nState Senate a race so uh we'll wrap up uh with that state Senate race as well and I'll tell you more about that as we get closer to that that's an inch studio one as well certainly my plate is not to bore you with my my programming schedule everybody but we've got a full plate ahead of us and if you're into politics particularly local politics\nWe got a lot of 'em I've got a lot of stuff I had a four year old [noise]\nYeah and if you go to my Facebook page others lots of good great stuff up there you want a friend male friend you're back as quickly as I as I can just a Patrick does Maris and we're doing real well with that a lot of politics\nBut not all politics lots of a pretty pictures for you if you think ah if you like pictures that here's something I just want to mention is a ... and we knew this was coming and uh I don't know I found out a few days ago a\nAnd I'm a local guy who I remember as\nA little boy seeing the Cape cod mall being built I think was back in the seventies or [noise]\nI can remember going to is either on the side that the Cape cod malls on or where the Kmart plaza is I Can't remember which I can remember my mother taking me to something called play land and if you've been around the on the Cape long enough you know what I was really cool if you were a little kid\nThat's all gone of course now you've got to strip mall in a in a mall across the street [noise]\nSo uh there's a lot of nostalgia for me I'm with\nForever that's where the anybody with things that you get changed like at the Cape cod mall says is a pretty big thing and malls across the country\nAh times are changing\nAnd there have been a huge mall person myself but ah malls malls where at one time just huge in real popular or I read you've got malls around the country they're empty or because there's no business so they they just just to win dark if you will\nAnd they're just sitting there the Cape cod mall or is no exception a and I think that retail stores are having troubles anyway because of something called the Internet and and who doesn't buy stuff online nowadays most people [noise]\nUh they do it's convenient it's easy you know and so malls particularly\nI think I'd been affected by that so we found out a few days ago that seniors are which has always been a huge store\nAlways has been a I Believe from the get go one of the main anchor stores at the Cape cod mall a Sears at the Cape cod malls closing\nAnd ah before Christmas I Believe the data September ninth which\nIsn't that far away and I think if you drive by they've got a big going out of a sale sign so if you want to go get a craftsman screwdriver cheap gene\nNow's your chance men go over there and probably get for like Ninety nine cents or something like that ... I think that's what they sell craftsman anyway the serious store the Cape cod ... going out of business the automotive store next to it I Believe yesterday was\nLast a day so again if you're a local\nAnd you remember Sears and you know the Cape cod mall it's kind of a an interesting ah is the change of the Sears is going out of business now here's the interesting question is a lot about this uh on line ... nationally isn't a lot of trouble why are they in trouble\n[noise] ah they got finance problems I think uh\nMaybe partly the Internet maybe partly some people I've read like in a Forbes and Bloomberg up at a commentary on the Sears chain\nThat it's their own fault but they haven't changed with the times\nAnd the business just over the years have gone self on them [noise] I don't know whether it's Sears is fault or not or it's just the times have changed but Sears across the country are in a lot of trouble\nAnd uh they've got a big note to be coming up a a a a balloon payment where it's involving many millions of dollars\nAnd uh they don't have the money\nI'm due to pay it so it's a it's it's a financial issue that's affecting a Sears\nSears across the country and uh it washed itself up on Cape Cod and the Sears at the Cape gun mall is uh is is about to go out of business but here's the question the amount of floor space at ah the Cape cod mall for Sears is huge\nI Believe it's the biggest story certainly as big I would think as as either one of the Macy a location to that you have there so the question is is what will uh it's Simon properties I think who owns what will they the landlord get for a tenant and the thinking is now you're gonna like this\nA gym\nA gymnasium\nMy producers looking at me like a gym yeah Jim why not whatsoever to Jim Jim school gyms are cool\nBut it would be like a really Big Jim I guess or maybe they'll split the floor space up and it'll be something else but a gymnasium I think it's planet fitness I read which is a huge\nNational gymnasium chain I Believe\nA would be a likely a tenant to take that space because of the Cape cod mall cannot leave that much force base and stay financially viable speaking of staying financially viable\nI don't think it's in the cards or they have to fill up that floor space either with another tenant or or several tenants the other thing I've read which is interesting [noise]\nAnd and this is this is specific to the Cape cod mall I think is what you mentioned I was reading a national story that planet fitness is eyeing vacated Sears stores around the country um you heard that targets\nAnd Dick's sporting goods store a may be going into the Cape cod ma what's the targets the it's like a Wal Mart that would that is ...\nWatch out everybody geology is about to come on they are very rare moment\nUh yes it's um it's\nLike a Walmart it's you know it's a\nWell we need another one of those don't we produce frozen food now get outta here really\nYeah\nI Do not know why don't I Know these things and Dick's sporting goods isn't there's some controversy associated with Dick's sporting goods or I don't know but I Know it was on an undercover boss I think\nThat's a big sporting goods in targets may be going into the Cape cod mall and if you haven't heard Sears at the Cape cod ... we knew this was kind of come and we just want to exactly sure when are we now know when a Sears at the mall is closing a December ... that's a big deal because\nI you know a economically speaking at least in the mid cap area of the kids come all the big deal stories and their employees a lot of people so they have one of the main anchor stores go on there that's a big that's a it's something to take note of\nSo hopefully they will be able to replace it with at least one or two as a lot of floor space to have suddenly go uh\nTo go empty over at the Cape cod ... times are changing everybody malls are changing a there's a lot of stories out there nationally about malls and are they just aren't doing\nMost of them not all of them but most of them that just aren't doing as well\nAs they used to malls used to be like saying well they're not like the thing the thing now is the Internet and people like to go on line\nAnd they buy clothing they buy this buy everything uh online 'cause it's so much easier [noise] alright I this is just a a a little ditty that's out there a President Trump you may or may not like the guy\nThat's neither here nor there at the moment but ah the November ... election even though he's got two more years of his presidency I Believe\nUh some disagree with me uh it's a referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump and ah I submit to you that there is a great deal of anger\nIn the country uh about Hillary Clinton losing the election shacks they won the election but uh the general election the popular vote but she was lost in the electoral college ah and President Trump is the way we elect presidents he won in the electoral college so he's the president\nAnd there's a lot of anger out there are I hear a dog a lot from a people they are mad\nAnd how do you venture anger well you go to the voting booth on November the six and do you vote for any and everything with the dean next ... same and that's just the way it is and you may think that that's a stupid way to do it but a ... people have the right to vote the way they want to vote and nationally\nSpeaking a there is a belief it's called the blue wave a that what you're going to see is the house of representatives switch from Republican control\nTo Democrat and who the Democratic leader would be I don't know um and that may not happen I Love Donald Trump because I'm the guy ... one of the reasons I like Donald Trump is he is a the consummate politician\nI Wish you wouldn't tweet so much but he knows what he's doing and he realizes the danger and ... of the Democrats getting control the house of representatives that will be a bloodbath for him or they will torture him they may or may not tried to impeach him\nThey may try to impeach him [noise] and it's all for show anyway it's what the Republicans did Bill Clinton\nUh I don't think the Republicans ever had a shot of impeaching Bill Clinton\nOr over chasing a skirt and the oval office but they tortured Bill Clinton uh and they technically did impeach him on the house side and then go any further than that but it was a great show was very negative the country hated it\nUh so don't think that the Democrats don't remember those days and would love to get revenge anyway and they particularly hate Donald Trump [noise]\nSo anyway President Trump is a smart politician and he's out there on the stump offer a lot of these Republican congressmen or he was a this is out of Ohio\nShy apologize they\nHe was in Lebanon, Ohio who is the stumping for I Apologize everyone I don't know who the Republican Congress candidate congressman candidate is but he was in Lebanon, Ohio on friday night yesterday\nCampaigning for a Republican is very very smart for Donald Trump to do this right now to try to and Donald Trump has said and this is one of the things you gotta love about the Donald he has said in response to guys like me\nAnd a lot out of the political pundits out there saying that there is a blue wave and it's going to hit and\n[noise] you ... you're going to see things happen because the Democrats are going to vent their anger on November the sex I Believe that that is true I think there's a lot of anger on that side of the uh uh of the aisle [noise]\nUh but he's smart to get out there and stumped for the Republican candidates because as President Trump has said and I love this about the guy with a blue wave\nThere's going to be a red wave you gotta like that about Donald ... maybe he's right by the way [laughter] maybe they will be a red wave I don't think so but you never know and there is some articles out there where Democrats are\nSaying that there are a little concerned they're not so sure that will be as big of a blue wave as they may be fought a month\nAgo um this Brett Kavanaugh fiasco and justice Kevin I'm going through this confirmation process there's lots of blame to go around quite\nFrankly on both sides of the aisle it was a fiasco it wasn't fair to him it wasn't fair to to to this uh a woman who testified in front of the committee it was a fiasco\n[noise] but I challenge Republicans who are saying\nThat you're angry because of that confirmation process and that's going to play out on election day why you one\nYou have a you wanted a conservative court you got it matter how you got you got it so what are you angry about logically on everyone anything you've got what you want it the Democrats on the other hand\nWe're we're we're we're we're upset before all this happened\nWith Donald Trump and they lost miserably in the ...\nAnd there are two constituency groups you do not want to anger one is the ah elderly because they vote the second one I've found over the years it's women you don't want to make the women upset at you they're civic minded that have died and they go out and they vote and I think you have a lot of angry women\nI'm not going to argue the point whether they're right or wrong about the allegations against the judge 'em but I Do know an awful lot of them are articulating their position that they believe that women and they think she got\nThe royal shaft on this thing and they're not happy [noise] so if there's anyone that angry going into the November ... election nationally speaking Democrats not Republicans so [noise]\nI I I don't know about the red wave thing but I Love at the Donald Trump has that attitude and he says he says stuff like that say why he's in Ohio on a friday\nAnd a and he's out there stumping for this this is a Republican candidate and what is ... in Ohio if you're not familiar with it\nAnd if you're not familiar with the civil war and one of the great civil war too great civil war heroes geniuses actually came out of the civil war one was a guy named Robert de ...\nUh he was a Confederate general that was for the south everybody and then the other great genius that came out of the civil war military speaking ah was ah was grant\nI'm a and a grant a was from Ohio that's the connection people asking me why did even mentioned Robert de Leon grant why why why why why why will cause grants from Ohio and he was talking to whatever they call themselves Ohioans\nAnd so he was trying to you know say hey you know a great Ohio guy was was was grandad guy\nSo you know all of that\nPresident Trump references Robert The league\nAnd uh actually ends up you know praising Robert Daly as a great ah ... hero and all that kind of stuff do we have some sound gene of a President Trump on this and and the pushback that occurring and I love the a marine general who is a a chief of a\nOf a staff he he has gotten in there and try to um a smooth is over a little bit [noise] a lot of people I think it's unfair to do this but a lot of people\nThey got a real problem ah with guys like\nRobert de lever because he was fighting for the south and the south was fighting for the right to retain their slaves I mean the country you know those were the days you know Eighteen sixty people owns owned other people were black and uh even though in it to apply modern day\nNorms you know in in two thousand and Eighteen I think are a reasonable person would say that's not a reasonable thing to be hating Roberts Lee ... nowadays but a lot of people you know they don't look at it that way and that's why a lot of these Confederate statues a monuments men being torn down\nAnd it's a big deal for the nurses it's a big deal for those of us that our patients some potential patients uh or friends and relatives who are patients so we have two great gas or in Studio next year or so we'll go at it a ballot a question or a number one [noise]\nUm let's see what else do we have for you just real quick or if you go to my Facebook page we've got lifted up there a very busy between now and November sex there's lots of debates that I'm doing\nPosting moderating whenever you want to call it we've got some a live broadcast that we're doing uh the big one ah one of the big ones are all big\nUh is October twenty a fifth or it's the Cape and islands state Senate race between the incumbent Democrat Julian Sears his Republican challenger a love this guy to John Flora's ah John Flores is a he's my ... town councilor he's a a great guy real fast\nAnd that should

president of operations for Spalding rehabilitation hospital Cape Cod may I call you Stephanie\nAnd I also think you I Know again Sundays or a pain in the neck but I appreciate you Stephanie are coming yet\nAll right a lady's let's give them a few minutes and Beth I'm a good one for you because I honestly and I mean I don't know how I Am going to vote\nOn this question so give me the uh the elevator speech if you will on Patrick does his wife had you ought to vote for this a picnic go right ahead\nBy first um if you are in the hospital or if you have a family member in the hospital would you rather be one of four patients or one of six seven or eight patients that's the short and sweet of it and\nWe have been looking at this for Twenty years we've been working at this issue noticing that decline in the patient care increase complications falls\nUm we have noticed that we needed to do something as nurses at the bedside with a voice advocating for our patients we started out in the legislature unsuccessfully it passed the house once overnight over Twenty years\nUm we have contract language that has been ignored we've had um teen million committees I'm with staff and management that that are to no avail this we feel is very important it's all about patient safety that's where it started that's what it's about\nUm everybody a lot of places have limits we use the example of in daycare when you bring your kids to daycare\nThey have limits their if their second become and the pediatric unit of a hospital there are no limits you can take care of one or two or you can be taking care of five or six\nThere's no way to get any extra help it like in the evenings or nights when you're taking care of seven or eight people it's do the best you can\nUm that's usually that's nine out of ten times the response so we're trying to get rid of that we see um loads of research about complications with our patients read missions and this can solve it um\nThe nurses feel they can't do a good job when you're going in and talking to a patient is say good morning on not just saying good morning to you I'm looking at your color your lips you how you're breathing your eye me as a whole quick assessment wealth if you get into trouble and I've got seven other people down the hall\nUm someone is not going to get the care they need and in today's day and age where you have to use the computer electronic\nDocumentation and I'm electronically monitor the medications you're\nThat's taking you further away from the bedside so we are trying to put the center of focus on the patients we sit and most of the nurses that we have um\n[noise] that we have surveyed say they don't have enough time to do teaching a lot we hear from the V. in a a lot of patients will go home without any discharge planning we've had examples of nurses with the patient's not ever changing the dressing and a week\nI mean there's a lot of little things that we like to do but why I became a nurse I mean it's very different than it was Twenty years ago when I started practicing\nSays is vital and it's all about patient care when you look I mentioned daycare\nKennels elevators boat say everything is about safety and that's what this is about patient's safety I don't care what else you hear\nThis started out as a patient safety issue because we saw the decline of care we even had a debate about whether to use the word safe for quality\nUm this is how it all started and this has had progressed and we keep going and we keep going at it because it's about the patients and we feel we're advocating for them and it's the right thing for them to do\nBest picnic again she was advocating for a U.S a vote well done now in response to that advocating for a no vote on ballot question number one is Stephanie I'm the only against stuff and he was the vice president of operations for Spalding rehabilitation hospital Cape Cod Stephanie the floor is yours\nPatrick thank you so much um [noise]\nThis is obviously a very complicated and contentious issue and and I'm In conversations with neighbors coworkers friends family members\nTo really weigh the pros and cons of it and I think number one is that you know our health care system is very challenged by many many many things but this particular ballot question the way it is written and the nuances with in the ballot question will have very serious unintended consequences\nI see it as a flood flood written document that if it were written differently it may actually make sense but the way and its current state it will harm hospitals in hospitals are wonderful employers\nSpelling Cape Cod where small but we employ almost five hundred people and we do a great job of it in this bill will harm small hospitals especially small community hospitals like bald in Cape Cod\nRelated to what that was discussing with quality of care and patient safety I'm very proud of our patient safety record and hospitals now required to report on a lot of those measures and have been absolutely moved to improve their patient safety efforts and improve the quality of care\nIn California where this type of um mandatory staffing ratio is already in place quality did not improving the health policy commission report that was issued last week demonstrates that it shows that there were no significant improvements in the quality of care in California [noise]\nThird point if hospital staff can't if we can't meet the ratios it especially I'm speaking very much to a small community hospital likes Bob in Cape Cod of specialty hospital we might have to turn patients away if I Can't provide the right number of nurses to take care of X number of patients wearing those patients going to go\nThere would have to travel fifty miles to the next nearest rehab hospital which likely will be facing the faint same challenges as we're going to face and to be really really honest I'm not sure if we can't keep our beds full how we stay in business and I personally am\nDriven to make sure that spelled in Cape Cod is able to continue and honesty in this community and take care\nMany people we serve over a thousand in patients every year who really need a dark hair and this will be a high burden for us to be able to make it um\nThe third point is just you know I was relieved to see the governor Henri respond to the health policy commission report which was a very factual document and be able to come out and I'm as a vote no on this issue as well as the Cape cod times this week had a an editorial supporting vote now as well\nRight ah Stephanie adultery or appreciate that I Want to ask both of you to explain something to me that I Am concerned about in this and that is\nHow many nurses are we talking about here if this were to pass you both have studies I read that say different things to me uh and and even if I take the lowest one a bath which is ... which is your study you're you're you're looking at it by your own admission\nAnd and and within a course of about a month and a half because this would be implemented am I correct January first of twenty Nineteen this is the law hospitals don't have any say in those correct me if I'm wrong about that\nBut but but the M. S. the mass nurses association owns owns ... study Beth says that you'd have to hire somewhere between five hundred and thirty nine and a thousand six hundred and Seventeen ... and you know that I Am a the mass health policy commission which are Stephanie referenced and the governor himself that's why he came out against us Beth\nAh the numbers are higher talk to me about realistically ... what the numbers are we talking about how many nurses do we have to hire if this passes first of all\nThe health policy commission that came out with their study is flawed because they use the hospital industry is money and not money figures that they gave them they usually use independent data they gather they take six months this use the hospital in St figures and came out with this and six months\nThat I mean six days it does not surprise me that Governor Baker came out opposed to it used to be the president of\nOf um Harvard health care I mean let's let's be real the nurses are there um over a hundred thousand nurses return to the bedside you're right we will need more nurses obviously\nHow many but I don't know that your your study says between five thirty nine and one thousand six hundred Seventeen\nAnd then I think Stephanie probably would go with a number that's considerably higher quite frankly and then I have this map health policy commission and you got me I'm a lay person I don't know whether they're credible or not but the governor seems to feel they are they have a number that's over three thousand\nNurses so I'm I'm flummoxed I'm not sure who well there's a number\nIt does it need we need more nurses so ah if it's three hundred it's not going to be three thousand but if the child spittle did there there's six or seven maybe eight hospitals now that do this that meet the limits they do it without any problem with a lot higher it'll know absolute\n\n\nValid questions or voters to decide on on November the ... of this is I think of the big one is valid question number one it concerns the patient nurse a ratio of limits\nAnd right now we have a two ah folks in Studio to ah go back and forth with the with the ... with us Stephanie\nOn the ... vice president of operations for Spalding rehab hospital here in Cape Cod Beth the picnic she's a retired nurse at a Cape Cod hospital Beth ah according to a survey conducted by the nurses' union in April [noise]\nUh it says you're Seventy seven percent of Massachusetts nurses said they were getting too many assignments they report at an average work load of six to eight patients can either of you tell me I'm a lay person\nHow many patients now the ICU I Know that's already law not asking you about I see you but how many in general can you explain to me and lay terms at cuts the Cape cod hospital I'm lying there I've been in an accident blah blah blah I'm not in ICU\nHow many nurses are how many patients those miners have well\nAll the research points to anything more than four complications start so if I'm taking six paid it's seven percent increase um\nOf problems so if I'm taking care of six patients you're going to have one of the sex is going to have a sixteen percent chance of problems complications whatever um I Will say the nurses on the floor said the ... the patients as I said earlier\nIt's it's all about safety\nThe patients are much sicker than they used to be there in and out much the days of coming in a couple of hours before your surgery having your surgery walking around a couple of days are gone so we start to see the stress and strain and problems happen after for if we if you're taking care of more than\nJust so I was caught hospital with pneumonia ... and I'm lying there you're telling me my nurse has me and three others\nYes ... ... is that true in your\nTenure so it it's very different in a rehab hospital this is where it's hard to do an apples to apples comparison so typically are nurses on the day and evening shift each have six patients but they also have a CNA assigned to them so there's two people taking care of six patients which is very\nChallenging and busy but very safe and hand with ...\nAffect you are smaller hospital which is one of the show up the governor Baker made and coming up the other day opposed to this he's concerned with the stuff and use of the world they're hospital\nShore so are the ratio changed to five patients per nurse and I'm to be able to meet that other members of the team will\nLikely not be available to help support that nurse so I think are nurses will have five patients but there'll be doing soup to nuts care they likely won't have as many aides available and other staff to support so where every team oriented model so there's lots and lots of people\nTaking care of those ... helped me understand if I were to go along with you on this ... back to ... for a moment\nYou're telling me there are approximately four nurses assigned to a patient\nWell let me clarify that because I'm Talking about the bill so ... I'm Sorry for patients to wonder inside of Iran when I'm In the real world there's they take care of five patients during the day and this is on a medical surgical floor in the tower and an nights you evenings and night you can take care of anywhere from six to eight and then sometimes nine\nOkay I Am sometimes nine during the night shift and patients don't sleep at night anymore there's too much going on too many complicated\nNine ... right so but again in a rehab hospital then this is why this is a cookie cutter approach this is affecting hospitals that aren't like Cape Cod healthcare necessarily our patients do sleep at night lots of them so our nurses will have seven or eight patients overnight but many of them are sleeping\nSo about back to kick it off spittle for a moment so your your proposal if I went along with this it would change the numbers however they're walking through that again\nIf it would change the numbers on medical surgical floor like in New guard tower\nUm you know nurse would take care of more than four patients and now you're now there is an acuity system and that will be developed and implemented\nThat would if if you have pneumonia and you suddenly get and just ... just stress and have complications\nI can reduce that it's where the flexibility comes in and I can take care of only three patients\nThere's also a lot of misunderstanding about for for being so rigid if there's a fifth one F fits patient next door to me that has fallen or needs help our cry cries out for something I can go over there and help them I Can't just say oh I have my four\nI Can't touch that fits person\nSo that the flexibility the nurses will take care of who's ever around them but that's that's what it would be now the bill would be no more than four\nAnd I I Would respectfully disagree about the flexibility you can flex down you can have nurse with fewer patients\nBut be able to flex up and have a nurse take an additional patient are too you know our scenario I think of oh nurse needs to go to school called her child is sick we're going to need to have an extra nurse hanging around for those instances to take over that caseload whereas now you know what all hands on deck we spread it out every one manages especially for an hour or two\nThat was that was my read bill from this legislation was that the hospitals cannot ... and that's one of the arguments they're making about this your hamster bringing them to think on their feet and start switching the staff around this law says no you cannot suddenly reduce over in in in another section of the hospital you can't do that am I correct in my\nYes and no because I I Will say to you that if that happens once said that if there's an emergency were going on some now that you lose one of the nurses\nYou are not going to be fine they're going to evaluate you and see that that's a one instance and you won't get fined everybody thinks that there's going to be fine right away they're going to assess that fine\nSo but if it happens all the time it's suddenly that ... years short every single day you're you're gonna get fined and the thing with California to is this this was implemented and they have no fines they have no problems\nAnd the nurses here at Cape Cod are slow to take care of these patients will tell you time and time again they are overburdened they can't do what they want they can't go off the Florida have lunch they're lucky if they go to the bathrooms\nThey these patients are sick and they cannot manage more than for the reason that patients do well is on the backs of those nurses because they do a damn good\nJob [noise] definitely go ahead so can we talk about the fines of that because that would be great if it set up in a way that it\nUm gives parameters of you know how many instances of being shorter whatever before it but there's no detail again in the law and that is scary to me there is no parameters around when those fines would be put into place or how they're even going to be calculated suck finances for a moment death and Stephanie a I heard\nThe ah CEO of Cape Cod hospital making this ... made a big deal out of the finances of this ah and I heard you counter with hey look at you guys are making and I believe that this is probably true of a lot of hospitals up the rational on these guys are probably bring him down some some some good money I think it was three percent I heard you or someone from your group said that", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "14"}
