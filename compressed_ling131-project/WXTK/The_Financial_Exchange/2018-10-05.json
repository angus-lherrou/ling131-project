for senators are still undecided but this morning the clock is ticking for him to make a decision\nBut also you know potentially if you're talking about people who may have taken out adjustable rate mortgages myself included I have an adjustable rate mortgages and people who might have credit card debt people might have adjustable you know there's there's a whole bunch of different areas where you might have adjustable owns out there the costs for those people are going to start moving up as a result of this\nCity I I think we ... we all get very concerned about rising interest rates and what the Fed's going to do next and\nIt's important can be concerned about and it will impact financial markets it's also important to keep in mind keep in mind you know where we are in terms of historical norms and you can still go get a mortgage right now for under four and a half percent\nYou can still not not so much I mean I guess a Thirty Years' probably averaging right about four and a half your ears or eight right now I'm thirty I'm In a in terms of historical norms we're still at pretty low interest rates and I I think that this economy could still absorb you know\nA little bit higher interest rates at this point I don't think\nYou are in I don't think you're in danger of you know\nIf let's say the fed does hike rates three you know one more time this year in the times last year next year I don't think you're in danger of financial meltdown that that'd be pretty par for the course\nKnown it it it's not a case where rates necessarily lead to that melt down\nUm but it is a case where they likely do lead to some continued slowing in the U.S economy ... and and that's something that when you take into account the overseas picture you sit there and say gee you know it doesn't necessarily paint the prettiest picture looking out twelve to Eighteen months if we take a look at the probability for December rate hike now\nBack before this was announced we go back just a day ago it was about Seventy seven percent chance that we saw a hike\nOr in December we're now up to an eighty six percent chance so you know this is pretty much saying hey look the cake isn't quite baked yet for December and that rate hike\nBut it's getting pretty close this is another strong data point that likely points in that direction and probably you know all but assures us that we're getting that hike in ah in December up to between two and a quarter and two and a half percent that's where a the fed is likely going to be targeting short term rates than\nSay your production had been I Believe for for rate hikes this year and two for next year is that accurate I'm On the one to two next year okay and I'm wanting two to three next year it has this report change anything for you\nKnow I'm Still I'm Still thinking that the international stuff is going to be enough that it results in a a slowdown especially some of the data that we got in the last couple of days I've I've hooked on the south Korea number just because\nThey are a major manufacturing and exporting center and their exports year over year for August redound eight point six percent that that's not a small shift that used to be there the last time we saw numbers like that from South Korea was back in the store to twenty sixteen when you had the energy sector completely falling apart\n... looked players example of out a little bit further I don't mean to get too deep into hypothetical but let's say that we do see three rate hikes next year and a you know by the time December twenty Nineteen rolls around\nLet's imagine that us interest rates are significantly higher than other developed market interest rates well they already are keep in mind they already are today and that but that would you know really inflate things if a global economy Europe continued to stagnate and us to come to continue to raise interest rates ... what does that do to the global economy what concerns do we have than about\nThe U.S and global economy is and how people behave in those scenario\nWith a big thing that you're already seeing is in emerging markets you're seeing this this effectively dollar shortage that is a creeping up there and what happens there pretty much\nIs you effectively have people who they're trying to buy dollars because their own currencies are falling\nAnd what it does is it continued it creates a cycle where the dollar strengthens making it more difficult for people who own other currencies to buy it\nAnd it really can can create a slowdown in some of these emerging economies um so it's it has some really nasty short term effects there and and that's why when I look at you know one of the things that does concern me it is\nA certain extent dollar strength because dollar strength\nYou know makes it so that you have capital flight out of these emerging economies and in today's world you know that does have a very real impact on the overall global trade so sure I look at it and and that's part of the reason why I think the fed is only able to hike one more time next year\nI think another piece there of the puzzle is the overall that interest expense that the U.S is paying this is going to continue the ... into the budget as far as our ability to finance our deficit and pay for other programs\nAre especially since you don't have a lot of international appetite for us bonds right now yeah yeah it's a legitimate concern there's there's some stuff that's out there that I worry about\nAh what take a quick break here when we come back to move away from

reporting to fourth quarter earnings are right in line to thirty six to share the basically in line with expectations but they said that they expect to report material weakness in their internal controls and\nAh ... what does that mean yeah that's the big question I ... it could mean a number of things that could mean that\nSome sort of accounting was done incorrectly but they did say that they don't believe that they they've been going through things and said they haven't found any incorrectly reported financial statements yet\nUm but material witness an internal control means to me that\nThere was something wrong with your financial reporting documents we don't know exactly where it is but I don't know where it is they haven't said that they found it so it's possible that there'll be nothing it'll be possible they say you know we found a weakness in our controls but it actually didn't lead to any issues it's also\nI think more likely that they're going to disclose that there was some sort of corruption that they need to make the prior earnings or something along those lines so we'll see what Cosco comes up with your butt\nObviously that sort of ambiguity not great for the ... you\nKnow it's it's it's not really ideal it's not the kind of thing that you want to see their let's talk a little bit about this report or out of the wall Street Journal auto makers considering moving some more manufacturing a to North America and this is on the heels of\nA effectively the revised trade agreement likely being approved in a in the U.S Canada and Mexico but we've got representative shrimp BMW and dime we're at the very least saying hey we're probably gonna have to move more production into these countries which was the exact aim of the Trump Administration in pursuing these kinds of deals\nYeah I mean it shouldn't be too surprising heritage if you want to avoid a tariff now you need to move more of your manufacturing here in North America so\nThe new tentative deal which has not been put into place yet uh does require automakers to build at least Seventy five percent of cars value within North America that used to be sixty two and a half percent so that's you know up a good was that twelve and a half percent\nOr it also requires that forty to forty five percent of the vehicle is made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour or so that\nYou know limits you uh that that does limit you in terms of where you can be putting these cars and assembling them or what are we going to workers for this\nUh Mexico\n... it might actually be that you see the net effect this might just be that you know U.S companies have already invested billions of dollars in New Mexico plants they might just raise the new raise the wages to those to those workers there rather than relocating some of these jobs will have to say\nLet's talk about a drunk birds\nAnd yes I I I ... those are words I never thought I Would say in my life when you wake

is this this seems like the kind of thing that is like the the first scene in some kind of apocalyptic movie like nerds losing all sense of direction and flying into windows and stuff like that but what's what's actually happening\nHere my the birds are ingesting berries that have fermented apparently earlier than usual because of an early frost and Minnesota\nAh and because of that birds had been flying into cars windows or you know to really as you mentioned losing their sense of direction and it's been apparently a bit of a concerning apocalyptic mess in northern Minnesota is drunk

against the Yankees are we were just taking a look at tickets by the way it looks like he can still get tickets for about a hundred bucks and then going up from there\nBut um you know Brad we had you on I think back in February talking to us about the impact of the super bowl a and it seemed like he was pretty muted in terms of uh you know most cities saying hey we're going to be throwing parties at home and you know restaurant sales not really seeing much of an increase how does that compare to playoff series in the end all be\nSure a very different actually we see a pretty significant increase in a number of business categories but just to kind of recap how we do this I Want we we\nCarry transaction dated for millions of small businesses that powers the software that are small businesses use but it also gives us an interesting look into all these patterns that are going on in local market in different states around transactions between\nConsumers and small businesses in the city so for example we can look at last year's performance or four different business categories in towns where I'm a ... where there is a major league team in the playoffs in the what the impact is so what we did is our data science came normalized\nOr what the average day for revenue looked like in the three months prior to the playoffs and then compared\nA timeframe during the playoffs against that average and what we found was that there was a pretty significant change across the board so ah just looking at a ... a game day versus non game day on game days all these categories that we analyze thought thirty two percent increase in sales\nOn non game date you and they saw twenty five percent increase\nAnd then home in a way there wasn't a huge difference on a across the businesses that we analyzed and the difference that either one of the last last year was thirty two percent versus a whether they were home our way but there are some significant difference as we look at when you look at specific markets like Boston or New York I'm On those different dimensions\nBred guinea talk a little bit about those a specific differences there\nSo let's take Boston for example so ah there is a major difference in the home versus away average there so again I mentioned that the home or if you look at just when the team is at home how to restaurants and bars and lounges in life\nIn businesses and transportation business as fair\nI'm On average a across all of a city that's thirty two percent increase its Seventy six percent increase in Boston and when there are when the team is the way you still use the uh a bump in those businesses though it's sixty seven percent in Boston\nAnd then again looking at the difference between a game day when the red Sox are playing versus the day when they're not playing during playoff season\nUm there's seven point spread in that game day versus non game day across all cities but in Boston it's much larger it's almost dot twenty five percent that Seventy two percent lift on game day forty six percent lift on non game day so in general\nPeople are responding to the fact that the team is in the playoffs and actually getting out of the house and spending money with these businesses on on a much higher level and across other cities\nBut are you just looking at these ... metro areas as a whole or do you even get you know kind of neighborhoods specific in this data\nSo it it's difficult to get really specific because the sample sizes becomes smaller we tens of thousands of businesses across all of these cities but obviously we want to maintain a high bar or\nA you know the the repeat ability of the data so and the finding that we're finding so in some cases there may be a like a code that has a high concentration of businesses but for this purpose we really just looked at this on a high level we also have to constrain the against\nYou know are these businesses that are are trained acting daily making sure that it's not you know sort of a business that's open only you know two or three days a week that kind of thing\n[noise] very good bread we've got to run but thanks for joining us today thank you guys

dollars and eighty a\nSeventy three thousand dollars and\nYou've seen wages going up in that area from eight to twelve percent per year my question is are we just finding a different way to ship these goods or is there truly a decline coming in terms of the number of orders in the number of shipments that we're seeing across the country\nI think that when we look at some of the other day to the ... that it it is out there and I hate to keep going back to the south Korea number but we had a number from South Korea last month exports declined eight point six percent year over year if that matches up pretty closely with this decline in truck orders okay\nAnd so I look there and I say look there is absolutely a trucker shortage that is going on right now that probably leads to a lot of you know companies saying\nHey why are we going to order a truck which sits around with no dry for like ... that makes sense\nOr well to some whatever [laughter]\nAnyways what I'm trying to get at is what you absolutely have a trucker shortages probably affecting this but I also think there is a plot toning that's going on right now just because of that one time stimulus of effect of tax reform starting to wear wear off a little bit and I do think\nAh that you have some international pressures that reducing the amount of commerce that's being done overall\nSo we've been talking about a bunch of barricades scenarios talk about a bowl if you're going to be bullish on this economy up what is going to grow earnings for ... for companies over the next let's call it three years and then we've got tax reform behind us\nWhat is going to change whether it be political policy whether it be can you know consumer behavior what's going to change to make this US Economy continue to burn on all cylinders\nIf you look at the two biggest things that would have a stimulus of effect over the next twelve months number one is getting trade deals hammered out with all these other countries not just you know redoing NAFTA so getting that squared away just so you don't have an certainly from a supply chain perspective number two\nInfrastructure projects okay get infrastructure projects going figure out ways to get that money you know deployed and so forth we're going to have trouble getting enough workers there so it might even be something where we say look we need to come up with temporary visa programs in order to get workers in for\nThese infrastructure projects because we know we don't have enough construction workers today will never happen I'm not you asked me the bookcase yep you asked me the bowl chair that ... I did okay so that's if you want the most bullish case that you can have\nGet all these trade issues behind us figure out ways to get infrastructure don't get more people into the workforce in the short term\nThat's how you keep this party going for the next two to three years that's that's the ... so there's a path there it's tough okay 'cause I don't see the issue with China going away anytime soon but I don't see us coming up with any ... any kind of big infrastructure plan\nThat actually can get through Congress anytime soon so\nThe bookcase I think it's a it's tougher to stretch that out more than twelve to Eighteen months I think we still have at least another\nYear or two to three quarters at a minimum left here before this thing starts to get a little bit dicey but look I'll be honest if you continue to see wage growth like this that's going to stretch this thing out even more just because the concern is look if you don't have wage growth how do people spend they can only borrow so much if you have wage growth that question goes away\nYeah I guess at the barricades here you know it might not be great for the stock market you know as you seal slow down an earnings that might not be Griffith stock market but it's probably not that bad\nThe case for the average American worker because I don't think unemployment is about to shoot up and I don't think that wage growth is about to stagnate\nDepends what causes it you know if it if it's caused by just a shortage in workers and things like that yeah you can you can figure that out eventually if these trade issues blow up and continue to get worse then then you've got some concerns because they've got supply issues and when you have supplies shoes you got prices going up not because you don't have\nA demand for stuff you have no problems actually getting stuff to people and it's you know we've gone through that with oil shortage is back in the seventies ... we've we've talked about this kind of stuff before it's not pretty if you see that so all this does bring us to our poll question\nIt does in our poll question of the day is up right now it's up on financial exchange show dot com you can go over there and vote in our poll question is have you received more than a three percent raise in the last year\nWe say this or we asked is simply because we were talking about wage growth now we're finally seeing it in the early results thirty two percent of our listeners have received more than a thirty more than this three percent raised over the last year sixty eight percent of listeners received less than a three per cent raise\nAnd by the way we want to know so a respond to the poll but if you are someone that has or has not received\nA a raise in the last few years or the last year Texas Texas is six three five six six and tell us what industry the working man we're we're looking for some trends year I don't think we've quite seen any real big trends in terms of what industries
