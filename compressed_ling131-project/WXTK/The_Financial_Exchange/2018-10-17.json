what the hell's going on these guys are collecting pensions now over a hundred thousand dollars a year in their indicted or a stealing from the taxpayers lets this there's something so incredibly wrong with that\nThere are ... you know what I like when I when I heard the when I heard the governor say you know maybe we should consider not given these guys a pension and I said yes and I are you asking me I mean you're connected you're a felon you're convicted no pension not consider do you know what I mean I don't get it\nI got the why why is in the legislature doing something on that but that's a good classroom which they must act [noise]\nOkay so uh as we're dealing with the pension issues to pensions cannot be attached or can they cannot be removed until we have a conviction that can't be done under indictment that has to be done after conviction and it has to be done by the pipe Iraq the state pension board the governor doesn't have to control over it see should it\nPete Rose ... he's ... he's the c._e._o. of everything you know yeah but it's but it's but right right now it's the way the consoles invention forward stinks and how's that if a guy's convicted felon and he's going to get a pension like Billy Bolger too\nI listen I I I agree I think that what we're going to be looking at is it takes time it's a process it's unfortunate that the process gets dragged out but um we do have to and I'm going to die all this back no matter how it looks every one of these officers who is under indictment who's under investigation\nAnd I'm going to say this and and I mean this\nHas the presumption of innocence until being from orange guilty of course so once guilt is and we have a few of the officers that were um ah that have played out so that's that's a finding of guilty\nThey will go before the pension boards the pension board will conduct a review those people who are under indictment have not been found guilty of anything they presumed innocent like they will collect their retirement until such time as a a finding of guilt is issued if that is\nWhat the finding is and then at that time the pension Broadway review it it's\nIt's ... it's what we call

H. B. O. yeah HBO is the big they they get forty million subscribers of their own in the United states like they are the biggest competitor out there no one likes to talk about it\nBecause you know the oh they're all gave them a year now AT and T. yeah because they tend to evolve over another ... oh dear and Eighteen tea is coming out with the streaming product that's largely going to be based around HBO ...\nI think you know there's competition out there and you know I I Know that we always think hey you know ABC ... completely different product at this right All right um the ones that are going to be threats are going to be places like Amazon like a you know Eighteen empty now that they have HBO under their umbrella um those are going to be threats\nAnyway that Amazon and Eighteen T could collaborate [noise]\nUh what what what are you thinking well\n... the the big issue is Amazon has this mode right then they're spending what eight twelve billion dollars a year\nOn trying to sell like ATM fees product on Amazon or something like that when you think I don't know if Amazon would want to kind of ... their own offering in that way you get into the telecom business I just I don't know if that's where they want to be going ...\nYou know we'll see you say it is fascinating though ... ... if we did a poll ... probably not what do you think Ninety percent of our listeners have watched a net flip out yeah\nThey don't ... it was lower remember when we asked how many people subscribe to Netflix\nYeah but that's a different tone difference yeah like Tucker doesn't subscribe he's ... somebody else's no I have my own account thank you you didn't boil that still counts as a subscription whether you're my thought on ... only ... no\nNo it's just Chuck no my parents are moving off me how that's right yeah well I have five ... pay back the pay them back for college Fifteen bucks at the time yep\nUm anyway that the uh the Netflix story goes on and by the way if you own the shares their up Twenty one dollars today [noise]\nNot bad did they formed enough not today Mitch McConnell calls the rising budget deficit very disturbing\nHey you know there's there's a valid point here very when you have a bad economy if you if you're in a two thousand and eight and two thousand nine you should be running huge budget deficits right that that's when you run a\nTrillion dollar two trillion dollar budget deficit to try to get people back to work when you have a four percent GDP you should either have a budget surplus or darn near a balanced budget\nYeah typically I don't really like the ... just because it means that you're taking in more tax revenue than you need are closer to a budget balance a balance but you could see that so if if you go and take a look in terms of you know where the money is actually being spent okay\nIf you're talking discretionary areas 'cause that's really what we're talking about right now unless we want to talk about Social Security\nWhich we could that's what Mitch McConnell wants to do right\nNow wants to go after Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and I got to tell you is if I'm a disinterested party if I'm an actuary just looking at it financially oh yeah I said that's where you have to go you have to well it's really literally it's a nightmare\nIt is and and and here's why it is the biggest issue that you have to go after if you will get all the projections not so much today but going forward as to where our spending is going to be it is all going to be heading in that direction over the next Twenty years as we continue to age\nUm so you have to make adjustments to those programs just because they're not sustainable with the way they are set up today at the system that was put in place now originally Seventy years ago now it's simply is not up to date with how long Americans are living in the cost of medical care because of the two things that really don't work\nSocial Security is pretty easy to fix to be honest there's not much you need to do in order to fix it ... you can play around the edges\nWe talk just increase the tax or increase the benefit you don't even ... so I can do this I there's a great website I every time we talked Social Security and bring it up there's a website from the committee for a responsible federal budget or called the Social Security reform you can go to yourself and by around\nUh I and it's a think tank I don't know who I don't know you know what the cases exactly but here's what you can do okay\nSubject all wages to the payroll tax that covers Seventy two percent of the deficit that Social Security has beyond that\nLimits spousal benefits for high earners okay so if you're in the top twenty five percent of earners you can limit spousal benefits how much does that cover a just four percent I don't need something else\nOr if you calculate benefits based on the highest thirty eight years of earning instead of highest thirty five ... that covers an additional eleven percent uh and then the last one that I had there was one that most of the war at least thirty eight years don't they at least men uh most most people tend to\nUm and so if you do all of that there's one other thing that I did I Can't find what it was but it wasn't cutting benefits for raising taxes for Ninety percent of people up and it covers one hundred percent of the shortfall know catch their Social Security Medicare\nMedicare you can't fix where you just raise the tax rate raise the race the costs you ... you don't just raised the taxes you have to pretty close to double the tax on Medicare ... that we raise for Medicare in order to cover\nWe got to do something at some point right in the longer we wait a more painful it's going to be yeah McConnell I thought you know I Am not a ... I don't care for McConnell necessarily but he's at least being on a saying hey we have to address these three per and who can't spend all this money on medicate\nEvery year either well it it really is a question of how do you fix them if you simply go and cut all the benefits to make the programs work yeah you're gonna end up with an awful lot of unhappy people because now they don't have the benefits that were ... so you have to have some kind of compromise here you have to deal with the problems it's going to be some combination of raising taxes\nCutting spending and changing al eligibility ages ... ... you can't do just one because otherwise you anger just a specific group of people my view is always been a good compromise leaves everyone upset every everyone has to come out feeling like they lost and if the if you do that if you make everyone feel like they lost you probably did it right\nOur poll question today is do you think we should cut spending on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid you can participate in our poll by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com is there a generational divide on a topic like this they have like how generally speaking\nI can tell you baby boomers are going to say\nWell I don't want you to cut my Social Security benefits and I don't want to pay any more taxes and certainly don't want you to mess with Medicare\nKnow everyone wants to free lunch right you know so there's there's no divide in that sense that look everyone wants everything to be free you you can't have it you know it's we're getting to the point now where in the next Fifteen Years we're going to have to answer to get a handle All right we're not the answer um otherwise we're going to get answered for kind of like when you don't change your oil for twenty or thirty thousand miles\nNow could be could be I think that's what you're seeing there maybe retirement savings by age how does your four one K. balanced stack up to your peers it was kind of an interesting exercise to walk through you say to yourself okay I've been working hard on forty years old how much do I have relative to my peer group [noise]\nYeah what what was particularly interesting to me here was the difference between the average balance in the median balance and that in perspective the average balance pretty much at all those numbers together ... you know every four one K. and Iran together and says okay divide by the number that we have and that's what you get\nThe median looked at the person in the middle fifty percent who actually is right in the middle of the distribution\nIn every single age group the average was significantly higher than the median what do you attribute that to there's a ton of people on the top and that are doing a really good job saving money in most people are doing a great job actually what's the max you can save per year into a four one K. and if you are below age fifty at Eighteen thousand five hundred a year\nIf you are over age fifty it's twenty four thousand five hundred a year you get a little bit of a a booster to catch up provisions\nAnd Connecticut Company has been accused of over charging more

here's what we're trying to do when you've got to execute and I don't see it happening this this company's revenue shrinking\nYeah their friend John ... from the Boston Globe is reporting that uh Connecticut Company has been accused of over charging a hundred thousand Massachusetts residents for their electricity and we've all been subject to these phone calls\nYou remember getting these calls and the solicitation only you had a ... the Massachusetts electricity market has been deregulated and we can reduce your electric bill by fifty percent or some you know outlandish proposed\nYeah when when I used to live in Somerville age to get the uh the door to door knocking while they're not going to do yeah they knock on your door and they'd be like oh can I see your energy but I'm like no you you can't you could leave up but apparently this is a legal action now is being taken by the attorney general of Massachusetts\nAlleging that a hundred thousand Massachusetts residents which suppliers to these you know companies that were advertising and then they were being overcharged for electricity a\nTrans sounded like a bait and switch a scheme to me Chuck where your bill might go down for three months and then all of a sudden it went up quite a bit\nYeah and and they're saying that this costs are somewhere around two hundred and sixty dollars per residential account so it's about a thirty million dollar a settlement that effectively the state of Massachusetts is looking for on this one um\nEverybody that got scammed it looks like you're on average about what two hundred and sixty bucks yeah\nSomewhere right in that range there so it's you know this is kind of the first stage and trying to recoup this money\nIf you have a shot at getting it because apparently national

for joining us today\nThanks for having me she was what kind of expectations do we have we're we're kicking it off right now with a lot of the financials what kind of guidance are we getting in general for most companies heading into this earnings season\nA guidance was relatively weak side a and I I'm I mentioned relativity because uh compared to the proceeding three quarter starting with the last quarter of ... thousand Seventeen when guidance at really turned up\nIt was a modest me on the on the stock I'd still estimates for you with three has come down a sense the water got under way or the negative religion wasn't a huge uh but nevertheless was on the negative side\nIn terms of any specific sectors are we getting positive or negative guidance from any sectors in particular on this quarter\nSo management teams are a lot more active at a minimum or even if they are not providing specific\nAh if they have a lot of international is if a if their products or services incorporate a lot of elements that are exposed to the ...\nAh there is there is a fair amount of uncertainty as to what's happening with the emerging market\nIt's a we have heard about the turmoil in currency markets with turkey and some other nations\nAnd it's not clear to what extent that will seep into and have a bearing on their growth and most of these major American was to national\nUh they uh they they own substantial portions of their revenues are brought so uh as as does a cross cutter a a A R not clear at this stage that is showing up in management's commentary of guidance as well\n[noise] ... as far as um what we're seeing in markets right now the last week has been pretty volatile largely due to inflation concerns and rising interest rates on the back of those inflation concerns have many companies come out and mentioned rising rates as a cause for concern I'm thinking in particular\nAnything housing related or bank ... anything out there that potentially guiding differently with regards to interest rates\nSo so banks are left better fisheries off off of rising interest rates\nAre out of these major banks have big a mortgage lending operations as well but the bulk of their business or whether it's with corporations or with household\nBenefits or when interest rates go up beat the home builders in the broader a housing sector or that at the receiving end of that friend and a negative for them or there's plenty of other industries sectors that also\nA will most likely be at the receiving end and we'll have a negative impact on their bottom line one of the the key phrase would be over the last ten years is a ... is is very low interest rates have benefited companies\nAre in their interest expenses and a ... the ease with which they could borrow with interest rates going up a lot of those companies have to spend more on ... and that will have a negative impact on a\nVery good draws we've got to run but thank you for joining us today we appreciate it\nThat is ... from ... consumer strong right gig more consumer confidence in ... we've ever seen her yet we we've got good numbers there that the point that I always make on consumer confidence is every time we hit records usually something bad happened two years later like I Can't get that way I Can't get that out of my head when it's\nAlso sentiment statistic meaning how do you feel about the economy as opposed to how many corrugated boxers were bought or how many cars were sold or how many homes are purchased\nYeah my my view is just always think about it like I Will get just things that are familiar to me so I used to be a soccer player growing up right\nAnd if I had a great game and all of a sudden we won three games you know what I'm saying oh gee everything's great and I\nAnd why we run into a bus or the next ... it's just you start feeling too good about things and that's where you really need to get nervous because either you get lackadaisical you don't do the things you're supposed to do\nAnd I just worry about that when when we look at how people feel whenever everyone starts feeling too confident that usually means that the second something goes wrong that confidence withers away pretty quickly and then you're sitting there saying\nNow what do we do ten year treasuries at three Fifteen\nOr the president is upset about the rate of interest rate hikes he's quite concerned about where to be talking about that in the next hour price of oil here's some good news folks the price of oil is down two and a half percent dollar eighty a barrel down at Seventy dollars

I don't usually recommend it mhm they buy the top end of their price range they say hey the banks that I could borrow three hundred no I'm In a bar or three hundred thousand\nWell if they're doing that in rates go up the banks gonna come back to them and say hey rates went up one percent we can't lend you three hundred grand anymore we can lend it two hundred and Seventy yeah and so if that happens to enough people\nWent a sellers have to eventually say gee we can't get what we thought we were going to for the property and prices come down a little bit it makes it more sustainable I\nI think one of the biggest problems with low interest rates is that in it's not talked about a lot what say that you're saving ten percent of your money for home each year and you're making fifty thousand years you're saving five thousand a year five years now you're going to have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved\nIt breaks ... twenty five thousand\nIf rates go down there going to push the price of that property up which means that you're twenty five thousand represents a smaller percentage downpayment so it makes it more difficult for you to buy the place you want because we borrow more\nAlarming is rates are going up and you still have the millennial generation that hasn't bought a house the vast majority of your peers still\nDo not own a home or if you live and mom and dad's house long enough eventually they're going to be gone and you're just upstairs you know all kidding aside those generationally they there this is we've never seen anything like this heavily\nI I don't know about never I Would imagine during the great depression we met in the last four generations you know never ever see you got to go back to the twenties stuff you look at thirty year olds and their homeownership rates right haven't seen this before [noise]\nYou know you have a part of it though if you haven't and the issue for me is that if you think the fed is going to continue to be easy money in the long run it's a problem because those thirty year olds are gonna get left out of the appreciation that eventually comes in those properties\nSo move as quick as you can because you see they I think what\nI think you can anticipate and this is something I don't know the correct answer for Twenty years but I Would suggest to you folks that inflation is going to run hotter than interest rates and I think the fed is okay with that and they kind of tell communicated that you know they'll\nYou they they wanna see inflation running in that two percent range if it ran at three I don't think they worry about it I tend to agree\nI mean ... said as much I Know he said that in his last you know they said that he wanted to be you know a little bit more hawkish it sounded like and I know everyone panicked on that earlier this year he said look if we have to run a little bit harder to get to a long term average of two and a half two percent inflation will let it run hotter\nIn Florida the median home price is two hundred and twenty four thousand dollars median mortgages a hundred and Seventy nine so Chuck in Florida if your mortgage rate went from four point nine six that would be nine hundred and fifty three dollars a month to a thousand Seventy seven\nDollars from a hundred and twenty bucks yeah so did ... rising rates are having an impact there's no doubt about it um but I Would make the case in the long run your building more stability and more normalcy back into the market I don't think it's a\nProblem what do you make of this story though that Americans are starting to say gee renting is not so bad after all it's cheaper than owning and I'll tell you once you oh you must be experiencing this you know living through your first year of owning a home yes every weekend right there is money out the door and home repairs and projects\nAnd oh there's always stuff going on I got I'm doing a big bold plant this weekend I yeah I got a hundred and fifty bulbs then I'm going to be ... all around the ... the guy you know these are back on the oh yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun I won't be able to move well but yeah so you you've got this uh this jumped now that Seventy percent of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning um\nWhich is not a great sign of you are someone who is looking to sell a place in the next couple of years 'cause you potentially last buyers that would have come into your you know kind of your orbit\nUm I think that one of the things that is interesting on this is this is the very sentiment that could actually make homeownership more affordable in the long run because if people say look\nThese prices don't make sense and I don't want to be buying I'm not going to buy him not even gonna look no those prices are going to eventually come down and you're going to be able to see people who say hey things have come it's it's a pendulum swings back and forth or you know not seeing dramatic increases in in ...
