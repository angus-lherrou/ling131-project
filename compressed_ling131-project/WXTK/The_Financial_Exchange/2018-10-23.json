hundred and twenty seven points when does ... when does it become a buying up ... I think\nNow because here's here's the reality in a truck and I were talking about this excuse me I have to leave I'm going to go buy some stocks [laughter]\nI'll tell you why because I ... you know where it's sixteen point nine times forward earnings trucks has nowhere like Fort Fifteen I said no I checked a month ago we were at sixteen point nine now we're at Fifteen\nThat's assuming you get to eat correct but we're getting the the ease rioted even above ... expectations so that number is ... that number is substantial\nAnd it Fifteen times earnings that's the average price to earnings ratio ... which means we could have a major backup an interest rates and still justify\nThese stock price but the ... you could have a price to earnings ratio go to eleven what was it back in two thousand and eight and nine\nBut we have growing earnings even by what we've talked about which is barest of the burning so we've got eight or nine percent that's environment that will be very supportive of a Fifteen multiple on stocks ... and it would allow us to go to four and a half percent among bond that's just my substantive fundamental\nRight you're on your and you are you're you're not a technical trader who are who are fundamental and you're not worried you so you would by today\nAnd not worry about it because you're holding the stocks for five years ten years absolutely what if you're the guy though that's got to pay a tuition bill next August or being stocks or what have you been up all that has to uh\nThey that there has to ah you know pay a for a wedding you know they get the I guess that what you're saying is that money ... your long term you're fine\nIn the short term you a little nervous my issue is I don't I never know the short term my theory is whatever you have today ... that's created a little bit of wealth\nThat states to what you did five years ago as thanks for ten years ago what you do today influences your life five years ten years from now if you got tuition bills coming up next year\nI was any forecast is going to say you should be in stocks like ever because look bad markets can get worse right in the short term the market as a voting machine in the long term it's weighing machine mhm\nI not the lecture here but I I just feel like for a longer term money this actually is a rational entry points good and it's not a good time to sell if you have long term money that's just my ... year not selling today I'll tell you one thing of doing it in terms of in terms of acid allocation if this turns into a panic\nThat forces money into bonds against in my opinion every a dumb move to do to commit heavily at the bar right right but if it causes your bond that you'd like to get out of to go up in price right you might be able to pair off some of that and by some cheap stocks or leaving and the money market where are the same up\nWithout take any risk you heard it here first of all this is my opinion by John Mooney doing a lot to bring down my blood pressure you know there's this very appreciate you really should do is let's take a look at the yield on the ten year treasury or the ten year treasury three Thirteen\nSee none of the gun there you go now if that gets down around three and the VIX is only twenty three which is yeah your blood pressure is like around one forty seven right\nNow I Know I I look I'm not yours but as far as I remembered the VIX\nRemember back in the in in in twenty seven twenty twenty ... twenty seven and a twenty ...

of concern about uh the volatile commodity prices\nAre yes that that um\nSo it exposed to Cartier prices on both because as a producer a user of commodity\nOn primarily is natural gas\nAnd can but the

...\nYou know in this environment where you're talking about earlier the the one thing that we we always bring up with any stock is just how vulnerable is this to say deteriorating relations with China or increased terrorists is this the kind of company that will be hurt by that helped by that or or little impact\nOn yes a global recession that caused by increased Tatar decreased trade what effect it because it decreases the demand for products so you know they operate in a global world man a company is like the ...\nOn the free flow of goods are coming and going across bought it and um you know that that risk I Would say some of that risk priced and now we're just talking just eight times that I think\nYeah I just say at eight times earnings are thirty six billion dollar market cap

at\nSomething like a fifty billion takeover that definitely a company that can do it you know particularly uh some of the European chemical as like you know a lot like the F ... they could look to climate particularly if they want more of an American presence\nIn in terms of the macro and I kind of alluded to this earlier I Wonder if the recent weakness in the stock maybe flagging possible weakness that people are sniffing out in the global economy or just the economy at large I think that's a big factor and the reason why the stock has been weak\nUm yeah that definitely a factor you know they're looking at a economies around the world that have been a little weak or you know China and Europe the U.S economy is still doing very well on\nThe scale or that that can aging from around the world and threat to the U.S it hasn't yet happened but um you know hopefully some of these trade tensions better get results and uh you know we can be backed up by stock and watching them go off

Russia pumps the gas and then they simply put it in a pipeline and they send it to Germany so obviously their costs are quite a bit lower than ours because we have to\nPump the gas in the pipeline we have to freeze it and we used to put her on a boat and then we have to ship it and then we have to I thought and they put it in another pipelines are costs are considerably higher than those of Russia but the problem is\nRussia is corrupt if you look at what I did that you ... I don't know if you remember this but several years ago Russia just said to Ukraine who was misbehaving right we're not going to we're going to turn the heat\nOff in January and they did yeah these are not nice people and they could do the same thing to Germany and we defend Germany yet right we spend hundreds of millions of dollars defending Germany\nAngela Merkel saying well we want to buy it from Russian 'cause it's cheaper well fine you want to do do business with how much longer do you think it's going to be cheap me as soon as you start buying it from the U.S your prices going to go up from Russia\nAnd not to mention the fact that we are an ally and they are from right exactly there and if not an enemy certainly a potential enemy and and this is a case where you know the president to talk about\nEurope needs to come around and be a better friend and give us a little bit more of an advantage for all that we do and I think this is directly tied to the president's personal lobbying efforts to get your up in Germany in particular\nTo be friendlier to the United states and to give us more of their business and he intensely lobby Europe\nTo by significant amounts of el ingenious part of that as opposed to Russia who's held more German much than any other country in Germany has killed more Russians than any other country this is a case where I think the president was right\nI think it was a breakdown take the case and and he had the total law on his side it's good for Germany to absolutely because they're not beholden to Russia rough\nIt's like being beholden to the mob right\nYou don't want to old ... anything no no you do not he's not a good guy to be indebted to or to cut a deal with in many cases do we have determined why the birth rate is low\nChildcare costs are through the roof I Can't believe what it called it's ridiculous to take care of a baby it's now approaching ten thousand dollars per year they're saying parents across the country spent nine thousand to Ninety six hundred and ... annually for one child daycare\nUp talking about beating inflation up seven and a half percent what did you pay for a babysitter oh I was a kid you know\nTwenty bucks a visit I mean the fifties like straddling bucks an hour wasn't it yeah maybe five or six but I mean you go out for a night and you leave the person twenty five bucks or whatever and and they're very happy uh now you babysitters Tucker just so you know 'cause you're having a baby a sick twenty bucks an hour and that's why a lot of\nThe the the the I'm thinking about changing perfect right I mean the person in the in the in the relationship earns the lease\nHas competition here which is you know staying home and watching the kid is like a high paying job now is that a conversation your generation's having Tucker 'cause like all the millennials I Know both spouses are working right it they can\n... if your son never gets married I'm I'm sure his life will be a a worker be me and I I mean I own five millennials and both wrong and they all work they they're they're they work their spouses worked their boyfriends or girlfriends work\nLike does anybody stay home anymore no no no I didn't work you should you should consider the rent alternative when dealing with your five millennials as opposed to owning the\nRent red or rent the other guy I paid for them to fight I paid and I own the red zone and you're not alone okay yeah I ah\nI I don't want to know I Know they're still liability bit of a liability yeah but uh I I oh I just ... the cost is just unbelievable ended up and
