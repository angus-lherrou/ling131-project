packages center prominent Democrats the discovery was made around the same time police here in New York discovered a pipe bomb like device that actor Robert Deniro production company\nAnd it's been four months now since this lockout started back in June and\nYou know you're getting into the guy I got to be run out of money well and and you're getting into the time were this matters to be honest you know it's it's it's one thing where hey it's in the summer and you know you you've got to deal with you know this and that you're getting into\nIt it's cold out out of the company is the company does not seem to be\nBending they know that company is holding the two big issues if you're not familiar with it you got about twelve hundred steel workers for national grid\nThat have been locked out since June\nAnd the issues are the company wants to eliminate the defined benefit pension plan and they want to pass on more the healthcare costs to the workers and the workers are saying no where union and and we're we're we're we want that pension and you know we're we're going to stick to our guns\nIn the it's it's amazing that it has gone on this law in my opinion I Wonder what winter does to the cause of the company saying hey we're still getting the work that we're not getting as much as we want to get done and they acknowledge it's costing them more than it would with the the union writers\nAnd and what what what I'm curious about this is you know if if the company you know just keep kind of going along as this eventually those additional cost I Do think will come down because of the big thing that you're losing with a lot of these workers not working today if experience but if you have other workers that are building experience year after year and so for\nHim and where are they going to get the workers I mean these are ... are trained steel workers\nAnd again it's if it's not going to be a quick and easy resolution this is something that look if if they decide hey we're just not moving ahead with this it might take three to four years for that cost to come down I kept\nThinking winter was the thing the emphasis is is it might be wrong on that is in its emphasis ... this is the fact that\nIt's getting cold all of a sudden because now it's going to happen is these guys are going to be out there trying to fix heating that's that's broken and and when pipes go down I mean these guys to go out and fix something in Seventy two hours\nI Would think that the again if it was thirty five degrees last and I know you know it wasn't warm like you're at the point where stuff starts getting used to ... I think in January February even before then cold you know it starts to ramp up and so\nMy guess as to what ends up happening here is I think the unions are going to lose on the pension plan do just 'cause I\nI don't think that like you'd every company is getting rid of him I think they lose on that I think they get some concessions on healthcare\n... the day so far it may vary according to the union had made very little progress they are they they've had a dozen meetings and they've been cordial but but in a virus\nYeah I Hope it doesn't seem like they're getting anywhere so we'll see if they can get a deal but again yeah go ahead for months a paycheck eventually some of these guys have to be getting\nThe jobs you know they're skilled workers so they could be maybe they're doing side jobs some guy could maybe they're working on that Columbia gas pipeline\nWell in part of it you almost wonder if you know obviously you know their their union workers you wonder ... mother you know union jobs gigs or have you know handed him some work saying hey you know we know you're in a tough situation where we can help you out\nWe'll see we'll see I voted early today because I'm going to be out of town on election day but it sounds like early turnout is rampant across the country\nYeah the numbers are pretty staggering I'm going to be a voting later today actually why are you doing it early just 'cause I don't want to wait in lines on voting day that you have lines and I've I've just I don't want a chance it and you know I've never voted where I Am right now I only moved a year ago the suburbs you don't have lines to say no that's that's good to know\nJust want to get it done then but yeah you're you're seeing a early voting turnout in some cases that particular Indiana you up early voting turnout almost identical to presidential election year levels in midterms are normally you know significantly more quiet as far as the overall numbers that you see there\nDo we know whether one side is more fired up than the other is you know you have more Republican showing up more Democrats showing up to vote early and does it matter the like does it 'cause usually you only get about a quarter of the eligible voters that vote in the\n... yeah and it depends on the state and it depends on the count you know it's like there's different trends depending on exactly where you go so\nI don't know if you can glean any you know results from this as far as oh early turnout stuff that's good for group ... it really depends on the specific race non specific candidates that are out there in a lot of cases what does the polling indicate\nRight now in terms of outcome if we're talking most likely outcomes out there you're\nMost likely outcome is that you see the house they were or I'm Sorry the house go Democrat and you see the ... they are either really unclear and here's here's why it's so unclear is that if you look at one of the best predictors of how things are going to end up playing out it's what we call the generic ballot which is\nHey what voters preferences just for Republicans or Democrats\nAnd a two or three point swing either way from where the polling is\nHas a massive effect just based on kind of how things are set up right now so if you see things end up two or three percent more Republican\nYou could have Republicans keep the house and Senate pretty easily actually\nIf it goes two or three percent more Democrat ... winning a wave in the house and might even pick up a Senate seat though which is a case where yams don't take you don't see the Dems taking the Senate in under any circumstance if there's maybe a five to ten percent chance that I think they do but I think it's really\nReally unlikely usually dive thirty eight saying it's one out of seven I'd say it's lower than that they're smart though so that kind of know what they're doing\nOur poll question today is do you vote early I did vote early and I participated in the poll you can participate in the bull by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com deal vote early I'd be curious if the end results are that you have higher turnout I I don't know the answer is do we 'cause it's usually about a quarter\nOf eligible voters registered voters that vote so in in a presidential election I think it's about half right\nOr I'm pulling the numbers I Need to dig I think any of that on one of\n... the next segment which is regarding a new drug for the flu it's flu season folks there's a new drug available for the first time in gosh Twenty years I have\nNumbers actually if we want to do that first sure so in a typical presidential election year if we go back and I'm just going to go from kind of Nineteen eighty eight just the last Twenty years because you know it's kind of the relevant period we've been anywhere on the low end in Nineteen Ninety six fifty one point seven percent\nOn the high end two thousand eight sixty one point six percent so generally around fifty five percent if we look at mid term elections going back to let's call it Ninety\nYeah we'll go back then as ... as well uh we're anywhere between thirty five and forty two

I still am not convinced that were out of correction ... I think that we're going to continue to feel some pain\nOr possibly right up till Christmas maybe beyond but uh I I just don't feel like the markets are convinced that the worst is behind a Sega they want to go\nWell I I tend to agree and I was talking to someone yesterday and and the point that we raised in that conversation so historically if you look at\nMarket correction is defined as being a ten percent more or more drop in markets you know you see one of those on average every sixteen Seventeen months there really common you see those alive\nThe question is ... and the question that people have is look is this heading towards a barrel mark and defined as a correction or a dip of twenty percent more and more okay in the case that I made us look market corrections they're effectively ... they are test of the market to see whether or not the economy is strong enough to support current stock prices they're normal you'd see them a lot\nBetter markets occur when the economy is not strong enough to support market valuations it's when those tests failed ... that's what you get when those market corrections when those tests fail there\nIn this case when you look at it the one that we had earlier this year it was again it was a ten percent correction it was a test and the data came back over the next few months and they said\nHey we're still seeing an acceleration in gross yeah we're seeing wage growth inflation's tame everything looks good to go okay fine continue on on your merry way\nIn this case the data the next three months is going to be critical does it show a further ... celebration in housing do autos continue to roll over if the answer to those questions is yes mhm then you do have further room to go here so that's ... it's going to be really interesting because the trained on that data suggests the answer will be no\nLet's talk about how we got data out from the national association of realtors as it relates to pending home sales yesterday we saw new home sales numbers that were very disappointing a housing seems to be weakening despite the fact that there's a tremendous amount of demand\nYeah in in in housing I I think it is not not even seems to me it is weakening and specifically last month for the first time in a while you saw an increase in inventories in a decrease in sales and ... that's not a good recipe for healthy housing\nMarket no but I mean the increased inventory level is nowhere near where you'd like to see it like you'd like to we like to have somewhere I don't know Tucker would like to see Eighteen months of inventory available because that means prices were low but six months is healthy and I still what do we have three four months\nOr ... I saw charred on this yesterday I'm trying to find where it is a year ago yeah uh oh no this is just for a new home sales started not exist things so I have no help there but here's here's what we're seeing a new home sales to put this in perspective\nEarlier this year really late last year when things were ... ... we had about five and a half months to a new home inventory that was available new home not existing but I'm ... now okay today a new home inventory\nWe're up to seven point two months and that's tough for the builders you know so that because they're building these things on spec often it is in the last time that we saw numbers at that level in terms of the number of a month's supply of new homes not looking at existing but a new homes which again or a small part of the market but it's where you get a lot of activity\nFor jobs the last time we saw numbers like that was two thousand\nTens C. my observation is that the when I drive around and I see the new homes that are being built there these big mansion still a long one ... they're they're building a they're buying these two acre lots and they're building these houses that are I don't know five and seven thousand square foot house was\nBuying them but there was the only ones that are profitable for them to make if you could actually itself you could actually sell them and so I I look at it and that number is a little spooky and by the way that number in terms of months of a inventory for new home sales that number is increased each of the last six months\nOkay so we're building the wrong types of homes and there's an excess of new homes but when you look at existing homes in total real estate for sale is still under a healthy level you still have a lot of pent up demand most millennials still do not own a home\nNo and and it's\nBecause it it it and they're in their\nPrime age like a millennial even a young millennial now is like Twenty one twenty two years old I\nTook her where's the line from millennials to that next generation that we really don't like\nThese are like Twenty years old they are there any talk is that what it is okay Nineteen twenty yeah so Tucker I'll do a fact check uh let's see here between Ninety or to me eighty one in Ninety six are considered millennials are so millennials twenty to twenty or thirty seven\nTwenty to thirty seven so yeah you you still have even you know for younger millennials in that twenty four twenty five range you know they're still not buying at the rate that historically they have leaving the old ones aren't like a thirty thirty five you're ... or ... or not they're not in in its affordability you know that that is the key driver here it's a forty if\nIf Tucker could have found a home that he liked it or you want it he would have bought ... you know but I get the issue that Tucker's running into is the homes that he wants to either too expensive or other people are coming in a bidding up the homes that he wants to make them too expensive\nAnd it's just a matter of the you you've got a market that is not in balance right now it's got to change over time\nIt does what what concerns me is the things that prevent builders from building those smaller homes and those are going away right you know increased regulatory costs money raised to labor like those things aren't going away anytime soon so I've got concerns that the smaller homes that people want to buy them\nThere will be the use of the smoke machine the appointment did decide to show what waits for every one of us on the U.S\nFeel free to bring a bar

actionable ideas for thoughtful investors\nAdam heck of a week to happier how's it going\nYou know about a week ago I said I think on the last book started and I want I Want to let you know I Am on my back yard\nSo let's let and yeah I understand is it is not been fun I I Am not bullish at the moment and and I want to talk a little bit about why that is to see if I can get a response from me my view is it any time you get a market correction is a test of whether or not the economy is strong enough to maintain valuations\nWe saw one back in early earlier this year the economy over the next few months answered that bell and said yep we are strong enough in the market continue to move up words in this case we're seeing some pretty important data declining housing in autos\nAnd I don't think there's a chance those turnaround in the next few months I think we're closer to a bear market than a recovery here what are your thoughts on that\nThere was an additional component that I think we need to address and it's called valuation and actually it stick with what you know you just mentioned housing that autos because uh we just got earnings yesterday from Port and believe it or not a little for trading down to you know I'm a eight dollars on\nA beat the earnings estimate beat the sales estimate it reiterated the fourth quarter estimate of thirty one says okay\nYou know what sometimes just reiterating that you are in fact going to make what they said you you know what you said you were going to make good enough stocked up you know eight or nine percent today acquainted with his wife valuation better if you take a company like afford\nDown for now you will find value buying it thinking just stabilize Napa Catholic bored with trading yesterday on the low\nAt about ... times already I mean think of that and by the way yielding eight and a half percent [noise]\nWell that's the key here\nIn also one other point there when we factor in the earnings rose this is a point you know for the bulls that you do after that I have to acknowledge year\nIf you factor in the earnings growth that we've seen this year even with the market being equivalent to where it was the start of the year we are way cheaper on a relative basis than we were ten months ago so there is you know some comfort thing look valuations are stretched in general but that doesn't mean they're necessarily stable here\nYeah well I mean I think you and I are ultimately trying to find some sort of common ground even though you call yourself as a barren I call myself a bowl and here's why um because\nWe ... and you just pointed out if you take something out far enough it becomes cheap right and the ... been trading at fourteen and a half times already so well I Will grant you from the fact that GDP coming out tomorrow at three point three percent\nIs lower than it was last quarter which was for forty two I Will counter by saying yes\nBut look at where stock surprise and there there comes a point at which you sort of rebalance you say well OK growth has slowed a little bit but you know what ... come down so much that\nI'm willing to actually step in and buy and I think that's what we're starting to see today you've taken ducked down far enough that people are starting to say All right this valuation I'll actually step in and buy\nAnd I'm looking at valuations what in particular seems most attractive to you when we're talking either sectors are individual names what seems attractive to you in this environment where it seems to me companies that are pure gross oriented in don't have\nMuch in the way a cash for profits are being punished where's more stable companies are being rewarded a little bit\nYeah I I agree on that front certainly on on the growth you grow the names that hard if they don't have a you know earnings but look at financial um you know look at bank of America a Goldman Sachs\nUm Blackstone I mean these companies all three of them actually now a trading under ten times earnings right I'm In the case of some of the banks there they're trading back or you know one point two Times Book value I mean that the you know compelling um you look at some of the industrial I Know what\nKind of Adam ... Adam stop at the banks why are the banks of discounted\nBecause here might take and and\nI liked the bank okay um but my take is that uh\nUh too many people are assuming right now that the economy has hit its peak\nAnd that we're going down from here on that probably the second quarter was as good as it got and if\nThe economy is was as good as it gets that means that can only get worse and more consumers and the bank or at least single most leopard group consumers and that's the auto loan on housing et cetera a student loan or\nIf if the consumer is going down to Mexico I go\nTo the financial um talk holders have been getting rinsed for the last thirty days or should they stay in by more what ... what do you do\nI have been buying more pet it and it's it's been a painful right in fact my my single worst performer right now is a a company called bank of the Ozarks ... they actually renamed it ... it's been the poster child for\nConstruction is um for betting on construction and in this country stocked up about twenty five percent in a week and a half um because uh people a A R assuming that that the whole thing is if the house of cards and coming out\nIt's an amazing story

guy that I I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner\nNot surprising here they are planning to deliver\nEight hundred million packages in the United states between Thanksgiving and Christmas that's about six percent from the seven hundred and fifty million they delivered last year\nThey did not do well on their brown recruiting day either by the way do we know what kind of numbers they were able to bring in all nothing they they're not they're not saying but that's not good the all the\nUh people that were you know the reporters that we're going to the sites you said it was it was not strong they want it was the hundred or a hundred and twenty thousand they were trying to bring on that one day they're trying to do forty thousand\nJust on that one day so what they're doing here is obviously they're seeing their costs going up because of fuel because of wages\nAnd so what they are doing is they are raising prices on domestic deliveries and also adding surcharges on oversized packages and so when we take a look at their us business the revenue per pieces up four point eight percent for the third quarter which is the fastest growth they've seen in their pricing spent twenty eleven so when the last seven years [noise]\nUm so you've got prices coming up here my big question on this is whether this has an impact on some of the companies that currently offer free shipping name Amazon do they have to raise their prime price again they already raised at once this year that I have to go up again at some point\nNumber two you have target saying hey we're going to a two day delivery or a two day delivery for free for free\nWell they might be able to do it for Christmas this year can they continue that going forward because that's going to be a real margin squeeze so I think there are some questions then for businesses that rely on both UPS and FedEx\nHey can they maintain some of the pricing that people have become accustomed to and if they can't how much does that affect people's ability to shop online the same way that they buy in stores because one of the\nWouldn't that be something to fall of a sudden people started to go and buy into stores again because the prices are ten percent lower it could be logically\nMake yeah he\nDid for going to store with a lower price\nIf it was ... you know like you just about anything you're buying it you should get rewarded for you drove to the story you didn't ask somebody just delivered\nTo end or in theory that would be the case the other ... you know answer for these companies could just be hey we'll just raise the price of all of our products by you know two percent and ...\nWhich is different ways that different companies can hedge it I think they're going to react to a little bit differently but there's there's definitely inflation coming on the side of shipping we're seeing it one hundred percent right\nNow Seventy two percent of employers conduct background checks on all the employees that they hire in twenty nine percent\nCheck credit reports that's an interesting side I I actually thought it would be higher than Seventy two percent checking background right you would think that that would be pretty close to a hundred percent I Would think right you know you're going to have somebody come in and work and be near the cash register any job right I'm I'm doing a background check on make sure they're not an ax murder\nAbsolutely and so you know the big things that they're looking for when they do these checks you know can you be trusted with money are you who you say you are a you know those types of things they want to learn a little bit more about you we had to\nKind of hit a lot of pushback though I'll tell you if you if we asked if we did a poll\nAsking whether employers should do credit checks people get very uptight about I don't like credit checks I I like them that way back round ... I like them both I I Want to know as much and I don't care whether I'm ... hiring somebody to flip burgers or whether I'm hiring somebody to deposit checks\nI Want to do as much about them as I can and I think your credit score\nIs an indication as to what kind of character you have\nWhat if someone just doesn't take out any credit\nThat's fine that's fine ... like if you have a conversation about it before you hire somebody I like to know when I hire somebody I like to know that they have a strong credit score because of strong credit score means that they pay their bills on time well if they pay their bills on time maybe that means they'll actually show up for work on time [noise]\nYeah I made that means that they actually do the job that they're asked to do for the wage that they agreed to do it for\nI've always liked background checks credit checks I feel don't tell you I I just because there's so many reasons why someone could potentially have a bad\nCredit report explaining that's fine they I've had that situation come up before because we do credit checks and I've had situations where I sat down with a candidate and said jeeze your your your credit's all screwed up what's the problem well I went through a nasty divorce this happened okay well that that's fine right I just but I Want to know that and I I I think most employers\nBoy I I Can't imagine why they would not want to know that yeah I I don't\nView credit at the same way as you know looking at you know just don't have you know criminal issues I have you credit differently I guess\nThat was up two hundred and thirty six points are gonna be talking about some new menu additions at McDonalds when we return to the financial exchange\nNews is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means that your portfolio in the financial exchange with very Armstrong in ... on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique products and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and\nDigitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.
