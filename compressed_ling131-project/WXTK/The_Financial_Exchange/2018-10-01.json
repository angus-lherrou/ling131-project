Tesla is hemorrhaging cash if you are must had not gotten the settlement ... there was a problem with you know is that company going to exist\nGE he does not have a problem of have this company going to exist they will that they're not going to go out of business so we don't need to get you know to that point\nBut GE does have a case where hey if you want to have a future where you're growing and you can attract top talent you got away with a vision to get there and\nOne thing flattery never did and and I was critical of him on his ... what are you going to do with what's going to be that killer what's your honor they have that no one else can do\nWe never got an answer to that he never message we never got an answer to that question it was just well we are going to go through a strategic we're\nTold me what you want to do what you want to do what do you want to be good at\nIran Musk wants to make cars and he settled quite surprisingly on Saturday we had a spirited conversation about Tesla and yuan Musk on friday\nAnd I check may have been questioning his sanity for turning down to deal with the SEC especially now when you look at the terms of the original offer from the SEC I think it was very generous\nWhat it was it was going to be a ten million dollar fine and he was going to have to step away is the chairman of the board for two years what now happens is that he has to pay at twenty million dollar fines of twice as big\nTesla has to pay a twenty million dollar fine as well so now that find becomes four times as big he gets an additional year away from being the chairman of the board so he's got a three year ban on that position\nAnd he also has to have\n... ... and quite literally Twitter supervision ... do you need someone to supervise and when ...\n... they were going to ... maybe he could share somebody with the president you know the president could have ... ... it's not a fulltime job right have you seen how much do you want to eat [laughter] he won't be too much now\nBut uh so you will get this and this takes off the table I think the worst case scenario for Tesla which was that they can't fund raise and they're out of business by the spring they still have some hurdles to clear\nBut look this company as a going concern probably is not something that is you know imminent and that this company is going out of business but\nThey still have to figure out how to make cars profitably they still have to figure out you know if they have the demand every year for four hundred thousand vehicles um and\nThen you know why does on who they might bring in ... have you heard anything on the rumor before which uh the the ... seats that open up or the chairman heroin role\nThat's an important job because it's got to be somebody who is strong enough there's got to be very intelligent and they have to be able to stand up to you or mosque and say no you're not doing\nDo you think they need to be from this world the the kind of start up high tech world you\nKnow I think I think they need to bring in manufacturing guy in the like uh somebody from Boeing um what was the guy that ran for for years uh McNally a I'm a ... ... it can be a good fit their you know somebody that mosque would respect\nBut understands the automobile business in supply chains and and manufacturing because that's their big issues they make it\nSeem to remember about Tesla is they make a car in which there's a waiting list you want to buy a Tesla Model S remodeled three there's a waiting list that shows that they've got a good product the problem is they have not been executing and yet somebody who's been proven winner in that capacity all all he's probably too old he's got to be close to eighty now I question\nThough that waiting list though man who or what they're still not making cars for thirty five thousand there's been a lot of people turning turning down the ability to get all your a waiting list because the only ones they're selling a forty five thousand than up and people are saying look I don't want to get I didn't want to buy a fifty two thousand dollar kind of you still can't get a fifty two thousand dollars and watch go out\nGo out to next fall a year from now\nI don't know if you have much of a waiting list and and and that's the question that I always had his okay great you're gonna sail five hundred thousand of these\nDo you have the demand for five hundred thousand more every year right 'cause that's what they were saying and and I I question that because when you look at the vehicles people are buying today the most popular vehicles out there aren't the Toyota Corolla and the camera and the Honda Accord and the Ford Fusion\nIt's not what people are buying today right people were buying route fours they're buying Honda see RVs they're buying Nissan rogues\nAnd Tesla doesn't offer anything that competes with those anywhere near that price\nExplain what this nine hundred and twenty million dollar convertible bond coming due and march is this is a big one has this\nYou know I think what may have happened I think I think he won must probably really wanted to fight the SCC and and I think what may have happened is the financial ramifications of that fight may have dawned on him 'cause he's worth what twenty thirty billion dollars in that ballpark but much of it is tied up in Tesla's stock\nIt is I think he probably recognize that she you know this stock it go to twenty bucks a share in which case I'm wiped out in terms of my network\nSo here's the big funding question that testable has they have they have this nearly nine hundred or nearly billion dollar\nConvertible bond that comes through in March what's a convertible bond so pretty much the way it works if the stock is above a certain price it simply converts into stock and they don't have to roll over and repay that debt they don't have to write a check for no they don't ... it comes it comes to knock and boom you don't have to worry about you know refinancing and\nIf it is below a certain price though that that does effectively expire and they have to go and raise capital in order to pay that off in his new debt\nThat's a tough but that means they have to raise their prices their stock is up sixteen percent today Chuck and in order to avoid writing the check it has to go to three hundred and sixty bucks\nYeah so there are three o seven to share right now they've got to get north of three sixty effectively in order for this to convert to equity in for them to not have to raise additional capital it's it's a real question I've been talking about this for about six months now if the stock is below that price it's going to be a little bit of a challenge for them to raise that\nCapital speculation guy you know you get you get a chairman who's an adult right yet is Sheryl Sandberg somebody that that can run in and work with the lawn\nAnd then you get another investor yet apple that says well we're going to buy a hundred billion dollars worth of stock and and we're going to be a big player in tests or we're going to allow hundred billion dollars companies only worth fifty\nYeah my hundred well let's see how they buy chunk of Tesla right enough to get control the board or it wouldn't cost that\nWouldn't have much wouldn't happen went up to you on still controls so much the company he still got thirty percent of the company [noise] yeah but he's his powers been neutered [noise]\nSomewhat you know it's again this is this is a it's a slightly big deal but it's like there's not a whole lot that is going to change here in my opinion we watch a couple of new boards like I look at it and I go you will and got on the lightly the chairman\nOh he did get a very lightly but the chairman role I think is is really going to be interesting to watch I I if they do that right\nThen that could be a ... that could spell success for the company 'cause it would also it would lay the fears of investors they'd say okay would you eat we got it right we got a ... type person in there or\nDo you got to get someone who's going to come in and not take any crap for me All right and and that's going to be it's going to be tough to find as you on his ... you know whether you like him or hate him he's for medical you know most people don't like him now most people don't like working with him [noise]\nYeah it it it it is you still get his executive is going to be interesting to see who they can get to come in and fill that role because it's it's a tough task\nUp next we'll be talking about what used to be called NAFTA it's no longer called NAFTA I think it was thinking about changing the name to talks and tacos\nWhat about the United states\nYou know we've got to think of

I'm trying to go through and just you know it it's tough because in that manufacture if you do want somebody probably as manufacturing\n... I Would say I would think automobile manufacturing myself you know maybe you're bringing a German I like I even ... even ... I Will\nGet it also ... you know that's the first place that you look what are the issues with Tesla all manufacturing related\nI think a lot of them are why they've got great innovation in terms of their product right so I don't think you have to ... I I don't think people are going to say well the the products terrible ... I think you have to say how do we make the product I mean I looked at the head count to build a Tesla versus the headcount to build a Cadillac\nAnd it was a multiple check I think it was like sixteen or Seventeen people touched every Tesla and I think it was four or five people were touching every Cadillac\nTesla's biggest problem right now his credibility I think that is as big if not a bigger problem than the manufacturing it's just because they've always had manufacturing issues always\nRight but yet like in order to be profitable you have to overcome those you got to bring your expenses down they only have one facility that they manufacture from I I think it's just how\nComplex their vehicles are you know when you when you design you know an SUV that instead of having normal doors they open you know these ... it's like what the heck are you but that was a dumb design decision\nBut that's but again that's not a manufacturing problem that's why we decided we wanted to say okay we need to be that cool like they got a credibility problem they they've never delivered a single product on time and under budget I Know never\n[noise] why more Social Security recipients will see a real raise in twenty Nineteen we're estimating that the raise is going to be what two and a half to three percent French somewhere in that ballpark yeah so that means if the average payment\nIs fourteen hundred dollars ego three percent already five bucks yeah they you know the the unknown is\nIs how much Medicare part B and Medicare part D as in David will increase this year plus your met a gap coverage ... is typically a retiree is paying Medicare part B\nA there and at least Medicare part D as in David so how if those two premium increases are modest then maybe they'll be okay\n[noise] yeah it's it's it's likely going to be the case that additional Medicare premiums eat up a chunk of that extra forty five dollars might be anywhere from a third to half of it then you get an extra twenty five bucks a month\nHey maybe your ... policy eats up a decent chunk of that as well so you might end up getting an extra ten to Fifteen bucks a month when he finally net it out right it's not a lot\nRight well we are those the ... when we get the I think it's in October that we get the Medicare an outside\nLeave so I don't know the exact date that we get them I think it's it's not as an everyday to four weeks yeah now\nRight [laughter] a red ink floods the eye peel market this is a danger sign for stocks in my estimation more than ... eighty percent Chuck\nOf us listed initial public offerings and this year the first three quarters involve companies that lost money in the twelve months leading up to their debut so just thinking about a year you're getting all excited about buying stock in a\nCompany is going public and I and you know a lot of ... come to mind because where we're located but eighty percent of them are losing money we haven't seen numbers like this in a long time\nKnow in in this speaks to a fundamental change that we've seen in markets in the last decade um because this this is different from what we've seen previously there there's always some companies that I'd be oh and they're losing money I mean it's part of the game like occasionally you see that\nBut what's interesting now is if not just that you have companies that are losing money as they go public ...\nYou have companies that go public and then don't make profits for a year now okay and you can go through the list you can go down and talk about testable you could talk about sales force

show\nThat morning thank\nYou so what so why would a retiree you after they've wound down their career ended up going back to college at the conclusion of their working career\nWell many retirees who are you know getting all the time it today are active they are looking to stay engaged in one of the ways they can do that is by continuing their education\nSo it turns out that there's many options for someone who's looking at the that and the good news is that it doesn't have to cost a fortune\n... immigrants that yes some schools actually allows seniors to audit the classes free of charge that the\nCommunity colleges\nThere are programs that are available that yeah yeah\nAnd what's his ... program though I was reading the if the ... actually Berkshire community college ... shirt lifelong learning Institute\nThe ocean or lifelong learning and it is a network of one hundred twenty kids colleges and universities across the country that received grant during that Bernard a shirt foundation and it's really lifelong learning programs that\nAllow you to become a number and then take classes throughout the years so these are classes that you know members that like at Berkshire for example\nSixty dollars annually for membership and then fifty dollars or class so it's really a fraction of the costs that someone might pay if they were you know going back to school to after the ... circuit that get these\nAre programs that where you're not doing that but you're engaging in learning and you know ... ... ...\n... when I was in college I remember a number of my professors were retired CEOs I went to business school and they were you know the retired CEO of maybe Kodak or something like that are you seeing colleges and universities embrace retirees as professors are instructors\nAt these lifelong learning and um it many times to get inside of the teachers so they are engaged in planning the programming and that kind of teachers and they also you know encourage mentor ship so if\nYou're someone who's a retired lawyer for example they might help you connect with someone who wants to pursue that career so that you can provided by to them and sort of help them along as they curse career\nVery interesting that sounds like this is the future of retirement continue going back to college I\nMean it sounds like a lot of fun for the people I talk to you know there was a woman who had a career\nIn theater and was able to continue to not only teach her arm\nAnother woman who had to retire earlier than she thought and because of the medical condition but was able to really engage by\nUm you know taking classes and tell me she would've been ... at that had she not sound program that's gum others have met you know new spouses through the program um people really get very involved in finding a community\nA way that they're\nThey're able to do you have to join a fraternity now no you don't have to join a fraternity guy although\nI'm sure if you were a member of a Kennedy and that fraternity exist on the campus that you um you know are taking classes on you probably can connect with them as well\nYeah no they just like a homecoming right they go to
