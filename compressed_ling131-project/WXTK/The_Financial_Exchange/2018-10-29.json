hear about it but it is um [noise] it's nice to be able to help\nThem and let you said when he said to me very said\nSometimes you know you don't hear a lot but you know what we do are talking about big issues or whatever it might be said but the most important and the most rewarding are are helping people like a Julia a and a new type of stuff that Monica did in your office that's a that's what people are looking for thank you\nYou this would it be a better league would there be more interested in baseball if there was a hard cap like there is an hockey basketball and football\nNow it's not if you don't need it in baseball because one player can't transformed the sport that can't transform a team the way they can in in basketball as an example\nHockey is a team sport and balls and ultimate team sport you know you have a great quarterback but a terrible defense you not winning anything\nI disagree in football football you have a great quarterback it can hide a lot of things to look at look at the patriots last year yeah that was a God awful ...\nOr just look across the board the NFL and we have all the poor quarterbacking right now yeah yeah it's ... basically I still think a salary cap is an influence things I Know the just the issue in terms of our games yeah in terms of interests now matter of fact her whatsoever\n... interesting uh IBM i got news of this last night it was a sitting actually with my son were having dinner and I asked him I said you see that IBM's ... red hat and he was shocked when I told them how much they were paying for the company hundred and Ninety dollars a share\nYeah this this is effectively and in mission by IBM in a very expensive admission\nThat what they've tried to do over the last decade hasn't worked that's ... that's the message that I take from this because red hat was a company that was valued know somewhere around Eighteen billion dollars and it was trading about six times sales and they paid eleven times sales\nFor this company in red have pretty much what they do their their cloud computing company that focuses on the Olympics development\nAnd this is pretty much the admission from I've yet it's a\nNew company it's not like it's what twenty five years old something like that it's not like\nYeah it was it I mean twenty five is you know I guess in technology that you're not a new film but you know ... this is a company that is an IBM that pretty much in doing this is admitting nothing that we're doing on the cloud side is working and so we just need to spend a boatload of money and hope that this works out my\nMy impression of the deal and I'm not a technology guy but it's like a Hail Mary on the part of any Romney yeah she's a failed CEO re she's been there six ... stock has been just miserable is pretty much the mission that she did fail and uh she survive\nThey give imagine if this 'cause the the the impression I have is they paid too much I again I could be wrong but if if this goes south and if this doesn't have a major impact like how long does she have to make this deal work year two years three years\nSo IBM as as a result of making this deal has said that they've suspended their share buybacks for the next two years in order to clean things up from a cash flow perspective they need the money for this is a big cash deal or doing I I look at this and in theory you've got to give her at least to the end of that just because you know that's where you're going to potentially see ... what happens there but\nI mean you will get all of the deals of this side that have happened this size that have happened in tech they generally\nDon't work out what um when when you look at this deal the thirty four billion dollar price tag 'em do way if you're a shareholder in red hat\nAnd you say why don't want to take a hundred and Ninety dollars you don't really have any choice there\nWhy would you not want to take the one Ninety you know just say you think it's worth\nI don't know two ten or something you want to ... all you can really do is vote against you have to take the cash maybe there's acts reason you don't want to do it yeah you have no chance your your your your that cat that deal that money's going to show up in your brokerage account whether you want to know how long does it take a deal like this because it's like when\nYou let's say I owned a thousand shares of red hat right\nAnd it's going to close is it is it the year end is it to one is a cue to some of these deals take a long time in it and some of them get need government\nFor what they're guiding to on this is that is going to take somewhere between six and nine months for this deal to actually close so it's not a tax issue for this you know it is likely going to end up being somewhere I Would guess and the second quarter early third quarter next year is where you see this close to late spring early summer is is kind of what you're seeing a for when this closes but\nI'll tell you if if I get this one wrong ... they're not\nBut of business because companies that big don't go out of business but they're going to be in a case where they're digging out for the next decade\nYeah you know what I said to my son I said this sounds like a G E type deal\nThis is something ... would have done I was not an HP okay yeah that may be a better you met maybe a better comparison because of the attack\nA relationship but we'll see you know it's easy to a to point fingers and cast aspersions we're not in the boardroom we don't have access to the financials we're just looking at I just said holy smokes you're paying a hundred and Ninety bucks for a company that on friday closed at one eleventh\nThis this is one of those deals and and here's the other thing is you look at this and you will get kind of when they're doing this it really brings similarly to that AOL Time Warner merger you know peek value weight like it just it has all the feeling of like something that just isn't going to work\nAnd you kinda wonder does red hat ended up on top with this deal does this become a red hat culture company because redhead you will get red had success and revenue growth and share price appreciation I mean they're they're one heck of a company\nThere still and here's the thing so red had they do about that last year they did about two point nine billion dollars in revenue IBM did you know Ninety five billion so IBM is still you know far and away the biggest piece why understand but you look at growth well here's the thing though is in order to justify this multiple\nThey don't have to grow just you know what they've been they gotta grow through the roof and I just\nIt's a really tough pot the spin\nOn the path of uh IBM is that this will access than to new growth categories and there'll be able to you know really improve their sales you know I I got to tell you I think Jenny is too old to be running this company or disagree with that tech companies I think tech companies need young CEOs\nI disagree with that now you know I mean look at Tim Cook Tim Cook is you know not a spring chicken he's gonna be fifty eight or fifty nine\nYou know in the next you know you had a good example you know so like I don't think you have to be in your thirties and forties gifts you know well they know that if any of our yeah but still he was older when he was no no he wasn't he he was a kid he started that when he was at Harvard nine\nBut ... I I Will get you know some of the\nSome of the again you know I don't know if you need to be in your thirties and forties but you just need to be good and Janine ... just not appeared to be able to turn the corner for the last five years we've been hearing oh we're going to be a cloud companies to be a cloud company and then they went out and bought a cloud company you know\nIt's just it's an admission of failure\nAre you better off financially today than you were when the president was elected a couple of years ago that's our whole question you can participate by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com a lot of people say they are not we're going to talk about\nThat and more when we return to the financial exchange your whole\nThis I don't know if she's going back to work because she had previously been ah wrecked by creative artist agency and that was her her agent\nUh she fired them or they fired her we don't know she went to United talent agency and they fired her saying that they couldn't make calls on her behalf so I think ... I Wonder if she untouchable said that my my pressure when you get fired by your talent agent\nDoesn't that mean that you you're toxic and they I mean the fact\nTalented the only way they make money is if they can get you a new contract\nUrine touchable until you're not okay and what I mean by that\nYou remember about a year ago when all of the me too stuffed with breaking on a Harvey Weinstein university K. and all of them she came back and he's he's doing you know stand up again in in clubs and things like in clubs yeah but but again if you don't get right back to the top you say okay I Need to rebuild the kind of start over\nIf he can get back from you know what he did which is far worse than what Megan Kelly did you know\nThere's going to be a path back for this question of what it is\nPlease take part in our poll are you better off financially than you were two years ago it's financial exchange show dot com or send us a text message six three five six six is our checks them [laughter]\nLike\nShow breaking news is always\nOn the financial exchange radio network\nNews\nGood morning I'm walk Perkins with his WMGK news update the national weather service has issued a tornado warning for South western bars the whole county until ten forty five initially it was until ten Fifteen it has been extended to ten forty five let's check in with NBC ten Boston meteorologist Tim Kelly keeping an eye on that potential tornado threat\nA lot of houses in here a lot of people it's a little bit scary you want to go indoors and let the system go by\nThe current so the threatening so right now is hovering over mash be around new seed Barry we will keep you up to date on the latest on this potential tornado threat once again tornado warning in effect for South western possible counting until ten forty five this\nMorning but then this fire department busy Monday morning responding to a reported structure fire on caster the Avon self then is that call came in around seven forty five nobody was injured and the fire was extinguished in sports is the patriots and bills in Buffalo tonight Monday Night football you can hear it on WICK kick off as at eight Fifteen\nThe NBC ten Boston early warning weather forecast for the Cape and islands wants this threat of a possible tornado passes showers through mid day then just sprinkle with a high in the mid fifties wall Perkins news radio ... five WICK will check it cut traffic right after this\nCouncil heavy thunderstorms affecting the ride along with the Cape six twenty eight one thirty to in fact to a tornado warning has been extended now for Barnes Noble county until eleven o'clock this morning still keep in mind that flooding could be a big issue for us shortly\nBefore the latest news refreshed at the top and bottom of the hour that was a campaign to get information to the news radio\nNinety five WICK use radio Ninety five [noise]\nW.

they're the most popular by the way I got that way you avoid getting aid\nI got an a to a to forty packs of these and we ended up coming out at just twelve and a half cents per a candy unit I guess so\nDo you do the variety pack that do the variety pack yeah in a hundred ... units was eighty eighty what are you get that many trick or treaters\nNo idea it's going to be a first year after treating

long\nYeah the average is up to eight point two three years according to analysis from Adam data solutions\nOr they have data going back to two thousand and pretty much as as you mentioned from two thousand through kind of ... ... people on on average was hey every four years kind of moving on whether that was you know because they were moving up to a different home whether it was because they were moving to a different part of the country that was the average that you saw\nThe average is you know again pretty consistently increase now up to that eight and a quarter years um and there's a

down to ten percent [noise]\nUh in that ballpark I Can't remember exactly what it was but somewhere went from about Eighteen hundred a shared down to you know the low sixties yeah about eight nine percent down again today you have one percent yell at you\nAnd I looked at their numbers I said the grow it like twenty nine percent how how can you be so critical for companies it's grown at\nTwenty nine percent its its concern on margins in certain areas there they had Marge has been held up in parts of their business but you know not the whole thing and and the problem is\nIf your margin start to show signs of weakness you know the the very small profitability that they have becomes threatened than in particular\nOn the cloud side of things you know that's that's the question that I think they're facing is you know the cloud side of their business is facing some competition not a ton at this point they're ganging up on them that's relatively stable but the the big retailers on the retail side that's where you're seeing pricing pressure because targets being competitive Wal Mart's being more competitive\nWell it's not only that ... the the workers are saying hey man you want me to show up and work at a warehouse which is a tough job right you you by any standard working you if you work at a an Amazon warehouses your walk or walking\nEight to ten miles a shift I think last time I read something as being the workers are really putting in a lot of physical effort you got to pay me and\nThey're demanding a lot more than minimum wage whereas five years ago in those on those things are sweatshops they treated their workers terror I I I'm not sure they treat their workers any better today but there is at least pain than better\nWell and you got costs going up for shipping and I mean it's it's you have costs going up and it's unclear Amazon can continue to pass on higher cost to their end users and the problem there is that you know they still\nAre so convenient to use do you like like I I must confess\nIf I just need something quick like say a battery charger or\nTrying to think what I Need a chocolate yesterday um and so I went\nYou can buy in the audience chocolate I you can buy well you know the big link chocolate bars assure you can buy twelve of those for thirty bucks on a good deal I don't know where he lives by um I I I'm not sure if it's a good deal but I you know you you it's hard to find write the Ninety percent chocolate\nAnd it's hard to find all it is it is I don't know maybe all the stores are sold out 'cause I buy something maybe that um but that that's it's so convenient chunk you know ... well they become the marketplace\nThat they have and look they're not going anywhere anytime soon again like we're talking about this with a company that's still growing almost thirty percent year over year so the rumors of their demise are greatly exaggerated\nBut having said that ... there are some cracks that are appearing where you say gee if they can't raise prices what was once profitable might suddenly turned unprofitable just because the margins are so stand on the retail side to begin with health and if they get more competition coming on the cloud side cubs sides world Providence you\nKnow it's funny you mentioned this because I don't know if you remember Tucker but John Mooney said this about six months ago John Mooney said look Amazon's a great company\nBut he didn't own stock and he said the reason I don't own the stock is I Can't figure out what it's worth you know like a you just it was impossible for John\nTo put a evaluation on Amazon stock you just said look I have no doubt that they're going to be a juggernaut company and might be a great company to work for and provide a great service that keep down inflation all that stuff all that you know that's all good yeah but he said trying to figure out the stock price\nHe said you have to figure they're going to grow at thirty percent a year for Thirty years in order to estimate that ... in\n... in the big thing is that where we've come to now is ... year later than that 'cause I sold a bunch of my Amazon stock of about eight or nine months yeah I remember and I I've gotten back in in the last week so you know it's good that we're talking about this year\nAnd the reason why is simply there's a clear a path now to the valuation that they have oh compared to where it was a year ago 'cause you've seen again you're thirty percent growth is big so you sit there and say\nGee there's a chunk of risk that's off the table now there's still a whole lot that left okay but you sit there and he said look this is a company that's gonna be doing you know two hundred billion dollars in revenue the trading four times revenue now it's a much clearer path then you know eight months ago when they were trading six times revenue and you're sitting there going\nBut they're ... revenue in a business with low to negative margins right they got some stuff they ... they still lose money\nYeah I mean it's it's estimated that on the retail side of their business there it depends on the quarter but they're anywhere between one in five percent margins in general that's where they they tend to live as right on that edge there the big thing is the cloud side and on their cloud computing business you know they're still in that thirty to forty percent range and a lot of different category\nBut all the companies that they compete with are coming in and saying hey we're coming at ya right you've got IBM Microsoft you had a lot of the ... area\nWell we you know what the heat and even if they just hit them on the edges on the margins right if the Microsoft deals from business with them from them if H. P. F. ... like it just seems like everybody's got their ... their ... or Amazon in their targets I\nIt doesn't matter until it does you know but when it does it matter big\nThe Dow is up two hundred and

so that means that they you know a greater percentage of people are going to run into something that doesn't kill them mhm but requires them to have care\nYou know used to be if you go back to you know the forties fifties and sixties\nYou didn't have a ton of people that needed this level of care 'cause most of the time\nWhat ever happened to them usually they were dying anyways you know they didn't have this level or the disability and they didn't live for ten years in that state no it's it's the medical advances have gotten to the point where we can keep people alive now but we don't really have a system or a way to take care of them easily\nAnd the problem I think is compounded by the fact that in today's world in so many families both spouses have to work in order to make ends meet and so you end up in a situation where a family member can't be that person carrying it a lot of\nCase what about assisted living facilities because that's a that's an alternative they you know I'm going through this with family members now where you know they're they're selling their house right and they're buying a unit in assisted living now that cost depending on where you are\nBut that's about four or five hundred thousand dollars but if you have equity in your home if you own your home outright you can afford that\nBut then you're looking at the the costs for this couple is six thousand three hundred dollars a month I really question how many retirees can afford six thousand three hundred dollars a month every month you not not that many it made me no families don't have that much in gross income\nNo in in in its in particular what you're going to see is you know so many people in ... really it's it's generation X and kind of the beginning part of the millennial generation are going to be in situations where they're having to care for parents yeah but also still having kids in their teens and a lot of cases\nSo what are you guys gonna do are you going to like have your folks moved in with you are you going to pay the assisted living facility yourself ... like I I mean right now I'm not joking about this this is a serious issue that millennials are going to have to take care of no way the boomers we're going to be you know we're we're going to be the ones that need taking care of\nNo idea I I I have no idea how to deal\nWith it really no easy solution is there no it's if you wear how ... what do you do put them in a warehouse\nYou've got two options you have care for them yourself you know or spend money so someone else cares for the ... like either way like there's no easy way to deal with\nIt because the nursing homes are closing ... we've seen a wave\nOf nursing home closures because they're saying hey the government regulations and this is you know this ... it's a it's a fascinating topic and I'm not an expert on it but you look\nAt the reason nursing homes are closing we you close your business because you're not making any money right right and and the government says well you must have this many nurses you must have this many doctors you must have this type of\nCare well the government regulation is driving up the cost\nAnd I understand the logic behind it right it it's kinda like daycare you get a lot of government regulation involved in daycare because a kid dies well same thing in a nursing home a senior citizen dies and the government feels the need to say well you must have this type of care available you must adhere to these regulations and then eventually these nursing homes say\nThey they wave the white flag they just say look we're done I talked to ... we have a client who who are used to run a health care facility and he said very you know you you have no idea what kind of merging compression we've experienced in the last twenty\nYears on in in in looking at this overall don't get me wrong ... these are good problems to have because the the you know flip side of this is look if people just you know pass away than like you don't have to deal with this problem but no one wants that you don't want your loved ones that just passed away it's OK we need to figure out how to care for him so it's\nIt's a good problem but there's no easy answers because of how we've built\nA boat the system right now that cares for people as they age\nAnd the fact that many families they can't take enough time off to care for these ... to care for a folks who need it you know in their families it's we're we're just not built in today's society to deal with these problems in that risk is going to be present whether or not we build systems to fix this or not\n[noise] an interesting topic that would require much more time and research we can solve isn't ten minutes no no no I don't think so hey
