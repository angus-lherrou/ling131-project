I I Know we have to get into politics on this but the ah the cabinet thing has awakened to the Republican base in a lot of the country in a way nobody saw but does that change anything from a policy perspective\nA you um that's a good point because you wind up with sort of the kind of divided paralyzed the main thing that we have now with the exception of what happens in the house and\nYou know to what extent as he ... pinned down by multiple investigations out of the house representatives so I I look at this and I say yeah they ... there's not much moving the needle aside from these inflation fears and when I look at something along those lines\nThose are things that the market can overcome in the long run because we we saw earlier this year they they did okay the inflation that we thought we were going to see over the first six months to this year didn't materialize we've not and miserable for you know didn't show up in the CPI the PC or any of those numbers that we look at\nAnd so those are things that the market can get over what it can't get over okay if you do have a material change from a political perspective Italy decides look we can't get along with Germany and we need to leave the euro zone hey that's a material change from how the world is today\nThat something that you don't just get over that you have to completely rebuild your model of how the world looks and how it works so from my perspective worries about inflation\nThings that you can get over especially because\nCould come out tomorrow and say hey I Know I said this last week but here's what I really meant by it and all of a sudden this whole thing goes away just like that it's done so\nAnd I tend to look at interest rate hikes from the ... we've had bizarrely low interest rates for ten years and you know it's actually it's been the fed giving the kids are sugar water for ten years and the faster we get back to normal interest rates that can be lowered you know when there's an actual\nEconomic downturn to stimulate the economy the faster we unwind the whole ... uh\nYou know taking the streets down to zero experiment the better as far as I'm concerned if it's a little painful in the short term and let's talk about that a little bit here okay because I think there was a really\nGood case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis hey we've got to get rates low in order to make sure that the whole thing doesn't fall apart\nBut then keeping them low for so long I think a lot of investors got accustomed to it and they stopped looking at stocks on the fundamental basis of what company can actually continue to exist if things ... and they said hey the punch bowls open why don't we buy shares of tests will because\nThat's not going to let them go out of business they'll keep rates low so they can keep borrowing\nThat's not normal though which the Fed's job and this is my not just my view this is how their charters written ... job is not keep companies and business\nDoesn't say that anywhere in their mandated not hey let's keep the stock market up and keep companies in business the feds mandate control inflation make sure that we are as close to full employment as possible correct so\nFrom my perspective I think a lot of investors got a little bit complacent\nAnd when they finally got down in and said jeep Powell signaling this and now you've got a little inflation showing up in a couple of places they panic because they may you may have been out over their skis a little bit\nPanics a reversible you know again you can you can put the genie back in the bottle it takes time took three months to kind of get the market back to normal this spring but it did so I Will get this it's a short term fluctuation I think you're going to see continued volatility\nDo you think that's I mean these things don't go away overnight would\nYou agree no I mean you're at the point where uh it you know ... ... let's remember that were nine and a half years into you know one of the greatest bull markets of all time and you know they don't go on forever and there are\nA corrections and there are changes and you know you've seen in the pressure market or to see treasuries trading round three point to guess at a time you know seven years yeah and you know when the summer they were two point eight so that's been\nYou know for a forty basis point move in the treasury market or in just a matter of weeks is you know rarely do you describe the treasury market as dramatic but that's pretty dramatic\nIt certainly is so let's take a

I was gonna ask are you doing you're a annual a fly on the day after Thanksgiving this year\nThis year and find two days earlier do are going down a little bit earlier otherwise would have been absolutely fine but I'm going to ... the big thing so I'm going after a Christmas this year I'm heading down to a Florida for a few days and just you know get a little bit of sun and you know kind of reset for early winter into force\nAnd the big thing that I'm seeing is the fights are just nutty right now like eight hundred dollars plus unless you want to fly on Christmas Day on New Year's day pretty much file 'em so it's it's just nuts whereas in previous years you know I'd be able to find stuff you know half that cost and a lot of cases even not on those May Day so\nIt's definitely a lot more expensive it seems like I haven't got to the point where I was poking around on spirit that's how desperate I'd gotten to find a cheap flight\nAnd careful somebody's going to come on board with a squirrel but by the time I finally like figure it out like how much it was all going to cost if I actually had a seat on the plane if I had to carry on bag it was still going to be like almost the same amount as anyone else yeah so\nI punted on that just because I flew spirit one's going to Atlantic City but uh you know there's a difference and being stuck on a plane for forty five minutes like\nThat and bring it on one like it sounds like a really great trip you fly on spirit airlines and then when you get off the plane you're in Atlantic City [noise]\nYeah it it everything kind of matches you know it's just like okay I I I Know what I'm getting into on this on all counts but I just for a longer fight I'm just not sure that it gets quite what I Want ... three trips to Atlantic City on spirit or less\nWhat what's third more of them [laughter] nine trips\nAnyways that is Wall Street watch presented by leader bank and the rent landlords stop chasing down late payments and skip

companies at night and I'm CBS you know as you see Wal Mart getting into health insurance does so much cost pressure uh this'll be a very interesting deal to see if the rationale behind it really plays out as we expect\nNow I did see a number of states have granted their conditional approval to this is well I Know that New York is potentially holding this up\nOr just because New York if they're in the yard if you've ever dealt with the insurance market in New York\nIt's one of the most highly regulated in the country did companies affected we have to create specific products for the New York market so I Do think there might be one last hurdle there but it sure seems like this is moving in the right direction at this point and there's been a long time coming here and you get\nA

now that their brand new product called the deposit\nIt's not a free program that streamlined the opening of tendency security deposit account there were totally digital experience and it was the deposit landlords can open the account online invite tendency to enter their information and then manage all the security deposit one place it also automate many of the compliance headaches for

month\nThe U.S okay five hundred and Ninety percent of the time has rallied almost seven percent so a we've seen this before is where is it is and in these kinds of mood in markets do happen typically their opportunities to buy and you're absolutely right\nAnd that's not only change yesterday and if anything headline that Wall Street journal literally just put out\nProbably you were calling me on is that a President Trump and she plans to speak at the G twenty coming up in November and from my point is that actually is is a change and it's good news um so you know that that that that's my take on on where we are at this moment\nOut on the book to drill down to specific issues or if you're looking around at a individual stocks anything that's looking interesting to you today 'cause it took maybe too much of a pounding over the last week\nYeah my whole portfolio although in in you know I'm I'm kinda ... good luck I go up you know call it and a half percent\nUm I gave up three percentage points over the past two weeks but that's okay it's all you know you have to go from and a six and a half but there'll be a\nAs I look at my portfolio now and I have forty nine name in ... um I've been adding to them on the field that I think are most apropos certainly for our listeners um believe it or not China I think China's gotten way over done I'm looking at Ali Baba ... be a be a\nBomb and that way though take or W. B. just a quick comment on each of these em Ali Baba speaks for itself right it's not just the Amazon if China if the Amazon of Asia they operate thirty difference subsidiaries are growing thirty five percent now trading under twenty or thirty\nBlocks down about thirty five forty percent from the high way though the Twitter of China has all of the Chinese celebrities that ad revenues are and they sell stuff on like you know art where all these celebrities belt imaginative came crashing were selling you know for whatever line\nOn on on Twitter I'm so they they\nMonetize that revenues are growing fifty five percent it too is trading under twenty times on and on and it down sixty percent from hot so you know that's my point there's a real opportunity I wouldn't want to talk about by China but guess what that is where the value is right now and I am buying them\nInteresting contrarian take on China Adam why the heck doesn't Twitter allow what you just described\nI don't know I Wish they would in fact I'm On Facebook I bought Facebook on the gap is one of my favorite scene when great companies have certainly been you know plenty of stumbles at Facebook and if they would just\nStart monetize in the platform yes with failed they're starting to do that on Instagram one quick so yup here's how it works and you see the started kind of fascinating but say you go to Google and you um you know you go to Patagonia because you like by the board short okay fine or you don't buy any well\nAll those cookies are stored on your machine and now Facebook has access to those cookies Facebook can see the U.S is Google that's how you start getting Google as well and Instagram al they're creating these um and then again they do that the way beyond China you're getting these one quick thing so in your Instagram feed it hey those ... you just\nSaw on Patagonia by them with one click\nClick and boom you buy them and to me that is the way forward a fact they're doing it on Instagram thing just to me they might start doing it on the main Facebook Platform that the kind of monitor ... that I Love to see\nThat I'm looking at a inflation I Want to circle back to that briefly just 'cause it's it's been in focus the last week both with again Jerome Powell talking a jobs report on friday showing you know three point nine percent wage worth for the third quarter which is outstanding to see and then obviously the PIN number we got the other day\nAnd then all of a sudden you get one of these today where the CPI comes in way weaker than it is no way we weaker than expected what is going do you have any idea what's happening inflation why is because I continue to look at all these numbers and they don't pay any consistent picture from one to the ... I I I feel a little lost on them\nYeah well I'm In you're absolutely right there's so many different measures at the ... the fate is traditionally looked at a what's called the P. B. E. four yup on and that's running it one night or two you can look at headline CPI depending on the month because it's about a number you know it it might be his Seventy nine\nSo there are all these different measures of inflation um the thing that I'm watching more closely than any of those headline inflation numbers\nIs way to grow and you know you just mentioned the one number you know the bureau of statistics a number I'm also looking at companies the fact that Starbucks is not going to start paying everybody Fifteen dollars the fact that ... one of my long\nUm and it got it somewhat I thought today by the way but um but it got hit a couple of weeks ago when I noted on a conference call that it's going to start paying people more ah that'll cut into margin lightly I also expect they're going to pass that on the on the wage growth of the a wage price\nSpiral is what my former economics professor Alan Blinder at Princeton used to always talk about it goes when when you start\nUm spiraling wages and prices\nThat's when you have an issue fortunately I'm we're still\nWay below where that become an issue um with the ... number two point nine percent it's not until you get to about three eight three nine that at the worry but a wages that that's what I'm\nFocused on more than anything else they're finally starting to move which is good hard working Americans make or they spend more than ... hurting one reason the polish\nBut not yet it hasn't yet crossed over where it scares me are good at and we've got to run but thanks for joining us\nOh Peter I wish we could go and there's so much to talk about the price for having me\nAbsolutely that's Adam Johnson from bull's eye brief dot Tommy put new picks up every Sunday Morning you can sign up right now at ... dot com were done for the hour we'll be back in just a little bit with more on the financial exchange\n\nThe proceedings that paid for advertising by the financial exchange does not reflect the views core opinions of their station its advertisers or I hard media here's\nThe latest from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan the cleanup begins hurricane Michael hammered Florida's panhandle as a category ... storm Christian Miller wrote it out in the town of apple logical law\nStocks might be the single worst thing you can oh\nOkay I was stocks but I don't hold them for my car payment I Need to make next month it just doesn't make sense and you know the one upside uh to what we're seeing with interest rates is you know you look go shopping for an online CD or online savings account and those numbers are finally starting to look you can you can find two years CDs at two seven five almost three percent now and if that's\nMoney you need twenty four months from now or you know in in my experience uh the last upside to you know money that you could have had in the stock market for two years is so much less painful than the downside of money left in the stock market\nTo like let's say that you've got ten thousand dollars but you put away for a car you know you need a car in the next year okay is it worth trying to get that up to eleven thousand with the danger that it could fall down to seven\nIn my book it's not just because you don't know what the market's going to do in the short term so I I tend to agree with you on that this does lead us to our poll question of the day how worried are you about the markets sell off very worried slightly worried are not worried at all Tucker what kind of results are we seeing in a in the polls us\nFor a leading the way right now is a amongst our listeners are not worried at all at forty two percent fall by slightly worried at forty percent and uh finishing distant third is very worried at Seventeen percent\nAnd I I like already and I think

I mean look at all the overtime games this year or two\nTon of them and in the ... the games the more competitive\nAnd there's a or B ... is a quarterback driven league at this point oh yeah of all the rules against the defense of yeah there are so many good quarterback like whether you're talking you know people make their first starts like Patrick homes or someone like that you have interesting stories in terms of quarterbacks to new locations you got her cousin's going up to Minnesota\nYou know you've got a lot of good quarterbacks now where did you go back you know five or ten years ago\nAnd the picture was just like there were a lot of teams that just didn't have a chance you know they they get on the field and it's a great you're starting Chad Pennington again great you're going to look like you have nothing that you can do their wares this year it's\nHey you know we're the Cleveland Browns we've been awful forever\nBut let's see what Baker may feel that you know it's just ... there's a little bit more interest especially in some cities that I think down and out for a while there are other cities that are going to continue to be down and out for a while but it seems to be more competitive as a whole\nSo the anthem protests and everything like that has had zero effect on the ratings this year you know and all the time they're not showing the old for that\nAnymore and I also wonder you know we're way has the uh current capital Nike ad campaign and somebody said that to that sort of pulled some energy on that whole issue away from the NFL and put it into Nike and that's probably good for football\n[noise] the thing that I still find fascinating on that whole thing is you know you you of Nike sponsoring the NFL", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "11"}
