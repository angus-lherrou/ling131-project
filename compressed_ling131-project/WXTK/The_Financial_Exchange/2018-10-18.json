about questions vary with us questions three we got the other side of the uh question three we already had the yes people keep it the way it is relative to transgendered\nAccess to bathrooms et cetera tomorrow we'll have a W ... who was on the no side of that let's say let's change it let's let's revise it let's change or because they're too many problems with it as they see it will be talking to her\nThe reasons for that obviously terrorists are going to play a role into that you have a tight labor market where look you could only grows GDP by pulling two lovers when it's all said and done\nHours worked and how productive you are during those hours if everyone's employing everyone's employed full time who wants to be\nHow many more hours you're going to be able to work there's only so many more people that you can actually get into the labor force so that means you've got to pull the productivity lover well we haven't seen productivity gains of any meaningful number and in the last\nDecade but what about robotics what about like you look at robotics if all of a sudden you've got robotic cars and robotic warehouses we got to have that next year well your ear the cars are coming this year right around the earth day in any meaningful\nNumber we got two hundred Ninety million ... we have two hundred and Ninety million ... of human driven cars on the road today and how many self driving ones are we going to have ten thousand twenty or you know it's like so that there simply aren't the productivity gains to be had\nSo what is it the the ... the neutral rate they like this is the part I don't understand I read the fed minutes and ... says and this is a quote from Jay Powell yep we're a long way from neutral at this point\nProbably I mean talk that that leads me to believe they don't really know what we're neutral like there are many they don't know we're neutral\nAs the other thing that you have to remember what the fed as much as they are a policy institution saying hey here's what we're going to do and here's what we're going to execute in the last decade really the last two decades they've become a messaging institution\nIt doesn't give you confidence so when you hear the chairman of the fed saying you know we uh we we kind of think we're a long way from neutral but we don't really know for sure I mean ... what what is it like we are investors want to know I thought they are rates go to four percent are they going to three percent and they go into two and a half when\nWhen I look at what Jay Powell was doing here and again you have to look at this from a messaging perspective what is he trying to signal yeah he's trying to signal that we are not going to let inflation get out of control because once it does get out of control it's really hard to put that genie back in the bottle\nIt's a lot easier for him to be hawkish and go to dovish ... than the other way around thinking about it if you start off dovish right and then you say hey by the way we got to hike rates really quickly ... what happens to the housing market what happens to the stock market okay it's a lot easier to be hawkish and go to dovish\nThan the other way so from my perspective and I think he's saying look\nWe're going to be as aggressive as we need to be in order to tamp down on inflation but I think if you get into next year I I I think that you end up in a situation where the economy's not strong enough\nFor it to warrant higher rate I think the feds between two really difficult their options here so you're looking at two more hikes that's it\nYou're looking at one in December me personally I'm looking at two more hikes and then I think the fed let's inflation run hot because they're ... I don't think you can get to the point\nWhere this economy can sustain four percent interest rate so hike in December and then one sometime in the first half of next year first Africa and I think that's it that's it right because I I think they realize they have to inflation run hot they just don't want a message it\nWell the you you may be right I you know many of you are buying a lottery tickets in anticipation of winning the mega millions a we have an office pools going I Wonder how many people who haven't have you I think everybody's in it we got everyone in yeah so what are we got like twenty people yeah it's like we get a couple of hundred bucks in there I think\n... winner odds not a\nGood [laughter] races are good [laughter] I'm going with Tucker [laughter] well let's look at\nThe uh the the the answers to questions that you might have if you were to win the mega millions a ... ... if you when it's a nine hundred million right [noise]\nThat's what it is currently it might go up by tomorrow based on how many people were buying tickets originally tomorrow is going to be eight hundred and thirty six million\nBut nine hundred million is the annuity amount sets like thirty million a year for Thirty years or something like a\nExactly and if I Want to lump sum so the lump sum is ... smaller okay if you take a look at the cash option right now it's five hundred and Thirteen million if you ... I'll take the lump sum [laughter]\nNow do you think the ... I don't care what it all now a couple of things stuck or to keep in mind okay the first is even with that you're not going to get that entire five hundred and Thirteen million dollars because they require you to withhold a big chunk up front so that Uncle Sam doesn't end up getting caught behind the eight ball when you spend it all on a yacht that only four percent right off the top\nSo they're going to take that right off the top okay which isn't enough because the tax rates thirty five okay up it's going to end up being significantly higher\nBut the other thing you want to keep in mind Tucker so you get five hundred million dollars after taxes you're going to end up with college somewhere around three fifty okay oh shucks\nThough not okay keep in mind you can't keep your name secret\nThe doctors had red heart I don't like okay\nSo everyone who's ever met you okay\nJimmy and grades including you either way I guess I'd have to change my clothes including Barry ... if you'd have to change you'd have to go on to witness protection alright ... there's only six states where you can keep her name secret Delaware Kansas Maryland North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina I'm so there's not a whole lot of anonymity at this point\nIt's let me ask you a question oh Chuck in all seriousness let's say you when the nine hundred million\nAnd I know everybody takes the lump sum but that means you're subjecting that lump sum to a five percent tax in the state in which you live right assuming you live in Massachusetts that if you live in New Hampshire but if you're Connecticut resident Massachusetts resident\nYou're paying five and moved to new ... New Hampshire before tomorrow way you can't that's the whole problem you've you've won that ticket so you're always Morrow I'll be by yeah well do you gonna do that just pick up and go right across the board if you take the newly option though you could move to Florida or New Hampshire\nAnd then have those taxed at a lower rate in those states over time yet normally I Would tell I was talking to Jim pleaded this morning as you were talking about whether we're going to take the lump sum or not and should always take the lump sum please tell ya\nYou know you're really forty percent right off the top Tucker so you know that number you gave five hundred and Thirteen movies really like so much\nYou get paid a year if you didn't take the lump sum it was thirty nine Thirty years or thirty million bucks a year which in the end you'd end up with how much uh you'd end up with somewhere around twenty million a year but you don't have like I Want to let it OK so five hundred you get twenty million a year when you get it out so down wouldn't have to\nPay the state income tax 'cause then you could move to a non tax state okay that that was the mayor went to the early on them you know if you want to move um how long do you have to clean the jackpot so let's assume Lee when and how much time do we have before we have to claim it\nDepends on the specific state but it's anywhere from a hundred and eighty days to a year so the big thing that they always tell people look if if you do win the lottery ... if if for whatever reason you end up winning this thing which odds are you're not going to\nBut if you end up winning this thing before you go and claim it mhm take some time to figure out who you're going to work with to get everything in order because the second you claim this thing up\nEvery attorney every financial advisor every person out there is going to want to work with you you want to find the people who don't want to work with you now the people who say I'm not really sure like you want people who are you know okay you know get your money and about two weeks and I'm Sorry you want people who are going to want to work with you before you have the money\nBut you're going to get paid in about two weeks with a ... like from friday you say okay you just friday night you're going to know you either way it's it's it's a\nIt's within a couple of weeks so before you actually go and claim this and you want to have all the legal work done that you need you want to have a brokerage accounts that you know you want to have all those things in order to have a place 'cause otherwise every one of their mothers out saying hey we want to work with you you want the person who already wanted to work with you before you had five hundred million dollars\nRight

L. D. law it's a law that basically limits the amount of time they're allowed to spend behind the wheel\nOr you know one would think that a trucker would be happy that they wouldn't be allowed to work and drive more than eleven hours during the course of the day but the problem is they spent so much of their time\nStopped and at a warehouse or picking something up that they are limited in terms of how much money they can be made because truckers I don't think people notice truckers often times are working by the mile not the hour\nThey're they're they're paid by the mileage that they do not by the hour in a lot of cases here and so because of the time limits if their students\nThey're waiting a if they've got a fourteen hour block where they can only drive eleven hours you know hey if five of those hours of chewed up by a just sitting waiting for delivery guys ... they have to load the truck yeah they can only drive nine of those hours actually you know that's how it ends up working [noise]\nUm and so the the big thing is that near the end up chewing up a lot of the time that they could spend working now are just waiting for deliveries instead\nOf the problem they have now is in the old days it was a paper journal and they they just the if you got if you saw and we also right you'd see a state trooper pulling over a trucker and they might look at the journals or they'd pull into the truck stop and they and they look at the journal stiff paper in the truckers could fudge those those records\nWill to E. L. D. those are electronic and it measures whether the motors running or not and you can't fudge that\nNo in in pretty much these logging devices were mandated as of December ... twenty Seventeen so what I'm curious to see in the years before if you take a look at the ... and really the reason that they're they're doing this is to try to make driving safe right now I'm just not just for the truckers but you know if a truck hits\nOr your car your cars that take the ball into the day you're that you're you're done okay and so in twenty sixteen as an example\nForty four hundred and forty large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes when I'm curious about is whether there's a statistically significant difference now that this law is in place here if we see we don't know for five years no it'll probably take two or three years to be able to tell but look\nI'll tell you what if that number goes from forty four hundred down to Fifteen hundred ... pretty clear ... even though you might not have all the conclusive data you need it might be a really strong sign that things are moving there if you go from forty four hundred and forty two hundred\nYeah you're probably a need for five years of data in order to figure out if there's something statistically significant that's actually going on here\nThe whole theory behind the law was that the truckers retired and they're having accidents because they're driving too much and they're exhausted ... right that that that's the whole genesis are ultimately should increase wages\nRight 'cause you're you're you've got your fewer truckers that are available to work even fewer hours one would think that these guys and gals would start making more money it is still not that there's not be although they are they are ... well\nI was there was the highest rate of pay increases that of any industrial\nI understand but it's still not where it should be you don't know about half of what it was in the seventh\nSo it it it still is well below where it should be the downside to hire truckers pay is that with how much we buy online today is going to drastically affect shipping costs and that's part of the reason why you're seeing the post office looking for ten percent hikes you know just about everything that they are trying to mail these days\nOn Amazon raise their prices by what twenty percent to be a prime member yep where they went up\n... it's all going to filter through now they only pay more which again these are people who should have been paid more to begin with I don't have a problem with it but that's what the

today\n\nAdam Johnson now joins us from New York you know we we stopped making segment you the founder and author of bull's eye brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors Adam good to have you on today\nOh thanks for having me as always\nAdam I Want to talk a little bit on raids cheering and specifically we got a you know some submitted notes from the fed yesterday and it it seems like there's a very hawkish tone there my personal view\nIs I don't actually think the fed is hawkish as they are presenting I think it's just easier to go from hawkish to dovish down the road than the opposite what's your take on the situation\nYeah I think you're right and I think it's also important to look at what they're actually saying and how kind of funny though these ... guys out there who read these I'm fed minutes and create all kinds of the charts based on the word\nYou know appear and the word strong or some variation of drawing like strongly are stronger strongest whatever anyway\nUh some variation on the word strong has appeared like thirty times in all of the minutes since April as opposed to a year ago when you saw you know some version of strong only like you know three or four so clearly the fed is saying you know things are getting better their quote unquote getting stronger but um you know\nIt it's at this point with GDP at it for ... percent and inflation still only you know in the two you know to point to to point three percent I'm actually a really good combination so it you know strong is not something I'd be worried about right\nIn terms of oil or oils been focused this week with uh the murder of the Washington Post journalist uh who were not sure exactly what happens but it happened but it doesn't ... really good\nThere's been a lot of talk as to whether or not the U.S is going to take a a retaliatory response in response to Saudi Arabia here\nBut the oil market not really suggesting that that's going to happen with west Texas intermediate below Seventy dollars a barrel after being above Seventy five last week\nIt merely suggesting especially when you hear the rhetoric coming out of D.C he doesn't sound like there's going to be much of a response here\nAgreed and by the way thank you for mentioning that you know because it's so we need to look at the headlines and jump on Twitter and and you know\nYou just get carried away with the emotional thing it's whatever happened there we don't really know what ever happened is crazy but ah what mattered more than anything else is the relationship between\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S you know Israel and Saudi Arabia are the strongest allies the U.S has that region and let me tell you we need them in spite of the craziness whatever the Saudis which\nClearly is pretty shocking world the fact that oil is under Seventy bucks tells you that the market is so dry there's going to be a breakdown in the relationship because if there were it'd be a lot higher than that the fact is on the Saudi Arabia the U.S and Russia\nAre all competing more than eleven million barrels a day we get never seen that before so there is a lot of oil out there and I'm Glad to see that the reality is that by the band was governing oil right now not the emotion behind the crazy situation however it went down\nAnd my question for your relating to a growth in twenty Nineteen ... you'd chatted a little bit about you know word for point two percent of GDP right now I'm curious where do you think things are going in Nineteen just 'cause\nI Will get the message out there and it does have me concerned about a slowing specifically\nLook with regards the long term GDP Growth there's two lovers you can pull how many hours do people work in the aggregate what kind of productivity that they have I don't see movement happening rapidly enough next year to get us back to three percent I'm curious what your thoughts are on it\nIt's going to be hard to squeeze more productivity out of people I mean you already have unemployment at what point seven percent of the year low yeah people are working hard you know our early\nA number of hours that are worked per week now that's trapped by the deal is you know it it's pretty strong it's hard to take it too\nMuch higher than we are now so I I hear you on the point about productivity um the good news is well there are a couple of pieces and you know me I'm an optimist but\nThere is technology now that he's touching absolutely every single bit I mean every\nTarget has become one of the target the store right has become one of the biggest abusers of artificial intelligence a high I mean they record how Americans are dressed in positioned around the store on Monday versus to this day and that impacts sales et cetera so\nIt's technology that's able to keep driving these additional games you know I mean think about what's happening in your Instagram\nFeed now where you know if you were on the Patagonia website you saw those baggy shorts you know where to cool down fast on last Saturday well all of a sudden out there's a there's a a one click buy this now\nAdd that appears in your Instagram feed and all of a sudden you tap water right so there is there's at least things that are happening because the technology that I think are are enabling businesses to be more productive consumers to be more active um and as long as the people are

... says the president is watching a caravan of migrants heading for the U.S border\nA boatload right you know but I think in general a they pay out maybe quarter of what they really\nDon't know I I don't know probably depends on the game and you know whether their state lotteries versus these national ones and things like that I I don't know\nI don't know bart is buying a cancer drug maker called into site for two point one billion dollars in cash why would they do that\nYes they're ah they're buying this company a for again that to point one billion dollar\nA price tag new year and you know pretty much Novartis if if you take a look at you know what they're trying to do here\nUm it's ... they're trying to buy effectively drug pipeline specifically related to oncology that's way under say really specializes in I have no idea and all of this is a good price or fair price for the company but the big things Novartis even growing much organically at this point in their sales growth was you know three percent for the quarter\nOr they're you know earnings growth was two percent for the quarter so they're relatively stable company right now and I think to be completely honest or going out there saying hey we want to try to buy growth for the future\nThat's a lot of them do the right they they they buy these little small\n... is the right now it's it's one of the main ways that a lot of these companies build their pipelines and grow at this point I'm\nJust because it it gives them away so they don't have to do the early stage investing they can say OK here's where the risk is right\nWe're going early stage there's risk even if some of these I mean we've seen cases where you know drugs get you know company a buyer you know another company that's been stage to her stage three of you know if the approval\nAnd the thing flops on his face and they got it right the whole thing off I mean there there still is that potential out there there's definitely less risk if you're going in\nTo this to the stage of company but there still is a lot out there just because again you never quite know what's going to actually end up paying off I mean think about all the old timers trials that have been out there for in the last couple of years where you've had come like Mark said look we're just we're giving all want to 'cause we can't do any like\nYeah they they're so much at all timers is one where they there's been a lot of false starts doesn't there\nIt it it's it's like fusion power we are always ten years away from a cure that's it's just you're

Shanghai costs in about a hundred and forty million dollars to buy this um which I Will get this is my first question to be honest was okay so they bought the land for a hundred and forty million to get your factory they built in Nevada cost them was three billion dollars I think\nWhere are they going to get the money to build this thing now\nYou know I Wonder if you no wonder that much that if the Chinese government's investing well and and this is where I was going so you on most 'cause obviously not a fan of the SEC the short seller enrichment commission as he called them a couple of weeks ago which probably didn't do any favors\nI Wonder if he ends up getting kind of pushed into China's orbit on this and do we really want to lose a guy like that [noise]\nWell it depends what kind of depends what you mean by a guy like that\nIt's pretty bright guy and then ... it'd be like you know you think about all the innovation that he's brought whether you're talking about pay Powell a space sex he space excellent yep I'm you know tests or whether you like the guy or not it's pretty smart guy either you really want to chase them into the arms of the Chinese\nAre really smart guy there's no doubt about it but I Would make the case you kind of chased themselves they're ... you know it's it's not like based on behavior yeah we ... it it's all his own doing that you know so I I just wonder if you start sending up working closer to that orbit but to be honest I don't know if you'd really get along well and\nChina I don't know that you know like I like I said he's going to be five hundred thousand cars a year there I don't know if he doesn't like the oversight from the SEC yeah you think he's going to like Chinese oversight right in Chinese oversight is come over here are going to put a bullet in your head\nSo it's it's it's something I I just don't know if he is necessarily a good fit over it but he might find himself kind of pushed into that orbit\nNow though is a

live in New England you bought a property in Florida\nYou bought it five years ago you bought it ten years ago and you rented it out so you've been renting it out collecting the income on it and now you're retiring truck and you want to move into that part property in Florida I\nGet a CPA yeah get ahead it yet so in the way that it typically works remember you can declare a property as a primary residence if you've lived there for two out of five years and being able to do that\nAllows you to offset up to five hundred thousand dollars and capital gains if you're married two hundred and fifty thousand if you are single that's the exemption you get if you're able to satisfy that requirement\nIt's a little different when you have a rental property in that if you've been depreciating that rental property there's going to be some recapture of that depreciation that you've taken and that\nWhat I wanted to point out on this story when you\nDo that you can do it you can convert a rental property into a personal residents you can get the five hundred thousand dollar tax regained but you can never escape that depreciation recapture you're always going to pay the taxes on that\nSo if you owned it for ten years and you wrote off two hundred thousand dollars in depreciation yeah even if you're within that five hundred thousand kept gain tax free cap gain you're still going to pay the tax on that two hundred thousand of\nDepreciation that you know it's really important to make sure that you happen to the tax advise you will get that that just because otherwise\nIt's going to be a situation where I I've seen cases where people don't realize that the case and all of a sudden the IRS is you know sending them a letter to learn and they're going gee I thought I got this exemption
