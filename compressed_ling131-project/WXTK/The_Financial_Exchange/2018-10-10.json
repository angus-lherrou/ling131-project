devastation on a scale never seen here before\nAnd they you know a lot of people who are trying to get capital out of those countries are attracted actually to the rising us interest rates so that's putting pressure on those markets the strength of the dollar is also putting pressure on them because it's on causing reduction in you know those you know countries currencies\nSo you know you're seeing you know the potential for our capital fled for market corrections in for foreign exchange moving across the board which cannot which can lead to the crisis\nThis looks an awful lot and it feels an awful lot like what we saw back in Nineteen Ninety seven where you had the Asian financial crisis that really started in Thailand um and started largely because at the time uh the the tide currency was it it gives known as the box\nAnd tied bought was effectively pegged to the U.S dollar in order to keep it stable at the time well what happened was that the government couldn't maintain that peg and they had the floated\nA in order to you know effectively tried to\nUm you know keep the currency of photo keep the country afloat and it ended up causing all kinds of problems throughout the region that ended up spilling over into the U.S as well\nUm for a short time period there what worries me about this in this emerging markets situations were far more tied into these markets than we were Twenty years ago it could have a bigger effect on the U.S and the effect is pretty significant even back in Ninety seven well and not\nTo mention that foreign exchange on you know currency fluctuations aside their vulnerabilities in the ah government debt to stress area you know you have 'em over forty five percent of these low income countries at a higher risk that the ... or already experiencing it according to the IMF\nWhich is compared to only twenty five percent five years ago and in fact we've already had a couple of these countries you know seek bailouts from the IMF and two of them yeah Pakistan you know aspirin IMF bail out you know earlier this year I Ching teenagers now facing that\nThis high levels of debt or really concerning and like you said have a clear impact because we are such an intertwined globally client economy today\nAnd and this is clearly when you when you point to what is causing this is the strength of the dollar over the course of this year as you mentioned\nA you know investors flocking back to the dollar with higher rates and you have the dollar up about eight percent for the course of the year and that makes it very difficult if you are in these other countries to keep capital in your local currency just because investors will say\nGee why do I want to hold the Argentinean pay so if it's losing forty percent against the dollar I could make fifty percent but still when we get ten percent of my money it doesn't make sense for me to hold that currency and that's why you see money walking out\nOf those countries here along with this or a statement that was made yesterday by Dallas Fred president Robert Kaplan so that he wanted the fed to hike rage three more times one in December and then two more at sometime next year and then pause at that point to see if any additional increases are ...\nDefinitely there watching you know productivity as one of the indicators are watching inflation they're watching whether or not we're starting to see some\nBubbles and some of the asset and that people trade and\nOn you know and they're trying to figure out what you know it's their right what they called the neutral rate which is a a level of um rate that neither ... nor slows growth and that's that's kind of tricky I mean some some you know economic forecast put that in a meeting estimate about three percent\nUm you know some say it's lower so it's going to be interesting to see what they decide\nLooking at what today is data has done I was a going earlier and I was checking out what we call the fed funds futures which uh predictions for where the Fed's going to raise rates are going forward into the next year generally the predictions on this they go out about twelve months so we can see to really next October at this point we can't see beyond that to the end of the year\nBut the median projection if you're looking at it there's a thirty six percent chance now that there are three hikes\nIn interest rates prior to next October largely unchanged from a day ago but that's up from just the twenty five percent chance a month ago and that's why you have seen interest rates rise a little bit\nOver this time period is people are saying hey look I don't want to get caught behind the eight ball and you'll be holding long term debt we need to sell this off because we're thinking rates are going to be moving up a little bit quicker than expected by the way\nTucker and and I believe you have this on the board at this point\nI Am on team we're going to have less hikes than expected because I don't think the fed is going to be able to hike yeah I think your production you're official production is one hike and twenty nine teams that it just fine that's where I'm at one hiking Nineteen so we'll see what happens or\nI Will take a victory lap because it looks like I was going to be right this year ... all pat myself on that for that one out but it's always a New Year's doubles the ah we get into\nA as we had the next year some sad news for an American or a great American company fears hiring advisors to prepare for bankruptcy filing\nYeah I mean definitely sad because it's such an iconic brand and such a part of Americana and a lot of ways but uh not surprising at all I mean given the rising online retailing where they hadn't been able to keep up\nAnd also just you know lack of investment in their stores um you know the years you know in malls no longer really need those anchor stores as much anymore because the mall traffic is down overall um so uh so unfortunately you know Sears is feeling the impact of all this trend\nThis also does give me the opportunity to talk about my favorite items from the Sears catalogs that used to be around and and there's all kinds of

situation about I think maybe a year or so ago\nI'm from five oh wait no think hacking imagine if a on the Apollo moon landing a Armstrong takeover due to a computer ... well here's the thing when we talk about hacking you're assuming that that computers networked and connected to other computers\nIf it's not ... not really a problem like you can't hack a super Nintendo you can't hack an Atari because it's not connected to the Internet or needs to be connected to air traffic control somehow why does the computer I have to be\nBecause they need to go ahead to land but what you're missing you're you're missing the the critical point here why does that stack why does that section of the operating system apt to be connected to what actually flies the plane\nOr you need somebody whoever's in air traffic control the land the plane to give it go ahead so that there needs to be some sort of line of communication between the tower and the plane\nBut why does that system have to be connected to the one that actually flies that is what is what I'm getting at\nI just literally told you\nTalk to each other no no no no ... you're saying that air traffic control has to be able to talk to one system on the plane what I'm saying is why does that other system has to be networked in and it doesn't have to be thinking about it this way Tucker when you go and if you've got to have

stays on the phone the entire time right it doesn't actually send it back to anywhere\nOn it it's not actually talking to apple ... how would the plane know when to land\nThink about it this way when you made it out of so many planes when when you make an apple pay purchased a you use your phone in that fingerprint scanner write write your fingerprint is never sent to the will to where the transactions process no I yeah I understand what you're saying and I think\nThat that's a different analogy isn't it because I think what Tucker is saying is that like there has to be a connection between ... fever as the join for us stand in the sky and then and then\nI I agree with that and I'll jump in on the plane I I agree with that but what it doesn't have to do is it doesn't have to be interface with what actually steers the plane\nDon't think you get what I'm saying I I I Do because there's there's going to be planes that are delayed or so\nAnd I had like a jewel and what a buy a plane landing it out of him is that what is the\nConcern when when you talk about how can the plane what what what is that if the concern\nIs that somebody else was going to take control the plane right in\nWhat I'm saying is you separate the control right from what actually what tells the point where to go in that\nWay I'm not even now I have I'm not even talking about hacking I'm Talking about everyday use of the plane and landing but what I'm telling you you can Saturday Night I said oh ahead go ahead for America trying to do what\nThey need to go ahead but the doctor when when I give apple to go ahead right do I actually send the my fingerprint\nNo exact that that's what I'm saying ... so you can separate those systems I don't think it's a gruesome allergy and all the exact

piloted flights but I'll have a whole row to myself and\nBe cheaper you think or be the same price nothing will change I think they would try to keep at the same as much as they can yeah\nMy guess would be pretty close to me the biggest cost the airline have are are typically fuel costs followed pretty closely um I think by just all the regulatory stuff you know William Gates and this and that I Know pilots are obviously expensive but\nYou know pilots they're not making you know a hundred thousand dollars a flight rights okay but you know there are legitimate expense but I don't think you'd be a huge shift in ticket costs just because you know fuel and maintenance or such big pieces there\nUm but I can pull up some data on that or\nAs we go here some breaking news that we just got flashing across earlier that CBS the deal or that my kid mentioned was likely to get approval today did get approval today that will done\nWith condition with conditions are likely condition we're still trying to get some data or some information on what exactly those or or it looks like the condition is that there's going to have to do with Medicare part D drug plan business over the well care

is an interesting mix year Christie\nYeah I found it really interesting but it's a it's really a move by travelers to try to meet customers where they are not as many customers are buying 'em through agents in fact there is a shift towards that buying things on line\nAnd said travelers is making a move by getting on to Amazon and and selling all these homes security products at a discount to current travelers customers\nAnd encouraging people to purchase insurance to travelers what\nI Do want to go back to the airline story briefly about pilots just I'm again I'm I'm a welfare planes so I get kind of caught up on these things up fuel costs typically this is according to the uh airlines for America website who knows\nA few expenses make up about Twenty one percent of all expenses that you pay for in a fight\nFederal government taxes makeup twenty percent labor makes up Seventeen percent now labor keep in mind is not just the pilot it's also your gate agents your flight attendants\nUh your maintenance crews and so forth luggage and then non labor in non fuel expense is making forty one percent but those are you know a whole bunch of different areas but waiver overall makes up Seventeen percent my guess is the pilots are probably between twenty and thirty percent of that so\nIf you had no pilot it might be five percent cheaper but I don't think you get much below that will be my guess\nI'm not back to this Amazon store sorry for the railing 'cause I like planes are what are we talked about this Amazon and and travel or story here\nI Do think it's interesting uh the travelers is is moving in this direction here just because\nYou know again the incentive for travelers as well get more people have security devices and rain monitors and so forth it becomes cheaper for them to ensure against losses would I'm curious about is your travelers isn't selling their own products it's you know different brands I'm curious how travelers ended up making money off this when it's all said and done\nWell it's more about establishing I think a presence on Amazon for Amazon itself moves into insurance\nGetting they well yeah I mean I think Amazon is slowly finding different markets that it can take over and the fact is is that there is rising interest in buying insurance and filing insurance claims on line to travelers is leveraging a platform that exists\nAnd is is saying okay we're going to meet you where you are\nDo you work with a dedicated insurance agent or do you just go on to you know whatever website you go on to him by it on line which how how do you typically\nDo right now I work with an agent but I Do that because I Do my research on line so I could see more and more people will be buying this on line ...\nInteresting it's all the time we

Rick Scott with Michael now a category for storms packing one hundred forty five mile an hour winds ABC's peak combs is on the Florida Panhandle\nThat's a people problem not a robot I Know I fully like anything that the people if if people can't wrap their minds around the fact that something might be safer now\nThat's not the robots fault no it's not you know that's that's like saying\nOh we we shouldn't like I I Can't even I'm trying to figure out like a comparable here just something that's like made a huge difference over the last like ten years that yeah it's a little scary to think about it actually works way better\nUm if anyone has me ideas you can test in but I just I find it amazing that we're so distrustful of robots and yet we just trust humans we say oh yeah humans can handle it when it's been proven time and time again that\nWe can't do a lot of cases it's it's not that I don't trust pilots it's just that robots are really really good at what they do ...\nAnd I'm I'm just a big believer and always having a backup plan to do with the humans have a backup plan at the robots that had a backup plan to humans I just think let's combine the two you know teamwork is always the better option\nHere's another problem with continuing to have a pilot's operating and smaller and smaller roles is robots do more\nIs there's actually been a number of studies done uh with regards to pilots the pilots that are ... so pretty much they're still rely on the auto pilot and on their instruments and so forth\nThat when something goes wrong they don't know what to do the same way that the pilot ... who who had been trained Thirty years ago knows what to do because they grew up in an era when they were much more hands on with the plane\nSo I didn't even make the argument that because of the way pilots are trained today\nShorter training times as well as more reliance on systems newer pilots that are being trained don't necessarily have the skills to be able to do that anyway\nSo I mean that just goes to kind of a fundamental kind of\nIssue across the board across different industries in terms of education exposure to different situations right I mean you see that even healthcare though is that there is a story recently about um communications and on the train a word in the hospital I Believe in the south shore\nOn and how they were looking at trying to regain variant birth on because there have been such a reliance on trying to control the birth that is very embarrassed or through the roof and a lot of doctors didn't have the skills\nAnd to to be able to handle you know breach birth and unusual pressed and they're trying to bring that back through a team model and I\nI just think it's interesting just you know we rely ON Technology so much that like you said we're not giving ourselves the time we need in order to develop skills and I think that there is an argument to be made across the board across different industries reinvest singing that

had a great couple of years here is taking a stake in Starbucks rather reviewing a stake in Starbucks\nYeah he's been historically known as an activist investor although I'm not really sure he's positioned himself as that and Starbucks but it's interesting the Starbucks Starbucks has been facing a number of challenges me in one of them it's just the fact that people don't want to sugary drinks for their ... aren't quite as far as they used to be\nBut they've also had to kind of slow growth and a lot of ways on they announce closures to that a hundred and fifty stories coming up and physically or twenty Nineteen which is three times the average number of closures that they've had previously\nUm they're looking at the urban markets to open up but they're slowly gross for their license stories as well like this are you seeing supermarkets and you're like that ... definitely a lot of\nChallenges there it's going to be interesting to see whether or not he kinda activates and that decides to push for other changes\nStarbucks is one of those companies each time\nTheir former CEO Howard Schultz has left you know he's left twice now and each time the company has struggled to find direction and I I I really you know if if it happens once you say well maybe it was just a fluke or something\nI Will get that and I I just wonder if it's one of those rare companies that need that specific person there in order to make it successful because\nThere is a person who's that transformational but also he's he still\nWilling to try new things right right I mean everything from like the new products you see that he tells you know adding and things like music and stuff like that um you definitely see you know how this creativity plays into the stores and he comes back and\nThere's definitely there definitely is creativity in a a I guess new idea I'm open mindedness in terms of Starbucks but the one thing that they really gave up on soon and throw in the white flag our white towel and on was the wine to remember that it only\nLasted for maybe like six months to a year they were\nTrying wine at some of the stores and it barely lasted a year and it's just like I feel like that could have been a really nice niche therefore Starbucks you know ... you know right around you know seven o'clock there is still technically open but he can go for coffee and dessert or you have a glass of wine and wine tasting or something like that I don't\nKnow what I Wonder about on that is if maybe I I I almost think that it could have been successful\nBut they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah you know is it don't they don't know what you call it like you're not going to call wind box but whatever you want to call ... limping that actually sounds smart but just you know Starbucks is a place where people sit down you know they might spend the afternoon working on their novel or on a business\nAnd or something and then a couple of people come in to see them but it might not be the right atmosphere for hey I Want to stop in for you know a couple of hours in the afternoon just for a glass of wine to catch up with someone I almost wonder if they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah it's a small place it's not a bar it's you know still more of that cafe fielder but just a different\nBrand yeah the environment just doesn't to me lend itself to kind of a wine bar when you think you know I invite you know you do get those kind of like modern sleep you know not really that the cafes wonder about licensing because you know and the other hand you're you know put up sending me hired that's tough yeah and you really have to go like town by town\nYou know how to download there should be like a wine bar or you know the Marshall Starbucks or something like that but it's something in downtown Boston or something like you know somewhere near Boston yeah I think I could see that happening a\nWeekly mortgage applications down one point seven percent we know of interest rates above a rather mortgage rates above five percent on thirty year fixed mortgages which just psychologically feels like a huge difference I mean don't get me wrong it is a big difference from where we were a year and a half ago at\nThree and a half percent but it just when you see that five in front of you know the the decimal point we haven't seen that he's alive [laughter] like\nI I think about it for someone like me and I'm someone who again by the time I got out of college rage were bottoming out okay I look at it and I say I've never seen that that's five number up their consistently when I've been in the market for house it just it feels different\nYup yup well and not to mention the market in general is also facing weak demand for re five which has really affected the whole industry\nThat that's the indicator that was kind of bothering me a little bit is that more homebuyers are looking at those riskier adjustable rate loans and to me
