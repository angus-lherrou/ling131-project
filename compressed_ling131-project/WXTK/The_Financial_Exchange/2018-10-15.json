get a dog when your kid is born because if the exact situation that I outlined if if it's terrible it's terrible but yeah this this market here\nI think is going to show a lot of the same signs that we saw back in the spring where hey it's going to take a couple of months to get this back together any kind of figure out\nWhat things should be valued at going forward so I don't necessarily think that things are going to fall off the table right now but I think we've got a couple more months to some of some volatility before this thing comes down here and\nSo got a few listeners chime in on the nurses ballot question nine seven eight says hospital professionals no better than the government and the other nine seven eight says Barry no question one more government involvement is never good gotta agree with that [noise] this isn't even\nGovernment involvement though well there's government individual involve them this is you know direct democracy and I think that for things like this direct democracy it's not the best tool because it's a complicated issue this this would be like you know if if you had a vote like ... you know what side of the road should we drive on\nHalf the people would say okay let's ... like ... it's just not something that you want people voting on I think\nYou guys follow the UPS story it'll\n[noise] a little bit we didn't really a dig into it last week those drivers got screwed so what is he going to happen here on\nThis I don't know but ... should be taken out back and shot I mean this guy is the scum of the earth that the\nHeat that the union votes fifty five percent of the membership says hey we do we reject this contract this is a bad deal we don't want to if you look at the New England numbers I looked at the the voting based on the region's truck\nIs like eighty five percent of the New England chapter for the Teamsters said hey we're getting screwed do not accept this field\nAnd you know the fifty five percent was just on a the the members who voted over all on the UPS Freight contract which covered a narrower twenty thousand workers sixty three percent rejected that contract and yet it's still ended up being ratified by union leadership here\nSo James Hoffa I think you're going to end up with a huge credibility problem for the union\nAnd this is the exact kind of thing if you talk about where you know populism tends to come from the kinds of things that we've seen over the last decade\nIt comes from things like this when the average person the person who is working every day feels that the people who are empowered to make decisions for them don't make decisions that actually give them what they want this is going to cause all kinds of\nProblems the one thing that the unions should be ashamed of and not the leadership that the members themselves the drivers the guy's handling the packages they didn't vote they didn't show up to vote no only about half of them voted and that's you know like you have no right to complain about your contractor union when you don't even vote\nAnd that's why they were able to ratify this damn thing because they didn't get enough people who voted yeah\nPretty much that's ... that's really the exact reason why if you go through and take a look\nAt the Teamsters constitution which I didn't know there was one button hey there's a Teamsters constitution\nIt quote grants the Teamsters general president the power to implement a contract if less than fifty percent of the members vote on a contract that then requires a two thirds no vote to reject it supposed to be that that's the case only in a final offer\nA but it looks like that's what ended up happening here so even though this contract was a rejected pretty soundly by union membership that actually voted it was not enough to overcome the fact that the president could pretty much go through and say yeah we're going to push it through anyway\nYou know the Amazon pays more than UPS\nFor entry level workers in these part time worker so if you're in this thing may end up settling itself just say oh yeah wage pressure to have guys UPS going to have a tough time hiring people for Thirteen bucks an hour when they can go across the street and make Fifteen at Amazon there were more they'll go to work in an Amazon warehouse\nI I'd be curious to see what you're going to be getting paid this winter into an Amazon warehouse you'll see the ads why I I'm going to guess Eighteen to twenty bucks an hour in this region why do you think management push to ratify this\nManagement or men ... union management why do you think union management push to ratify speculation that ... on the take\nI'll tell you what it is like if it doesn't look good it's not it doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nHe if you look at James Hoffa first of all forget his old man but you look at James Hoffa and his history that's not not Rosie I don't know how he got the job in the first place and he's a lawyer that you know they're saying you have to tone consideration no one's\nUh last year that more than doubled to Thirteen percent so if you work in biotech there's a demand for your services especially if you happen to be a scientist\nYeah and the big thing that you're seeing is in order for these companies to try to retain talent obviously wages are moving up significantly but they're also throwing all kinds of perks people just try to keep him on board anything from gym memberships a you know uh you know the cafeterias on site that or you know high quality and this and that\nChild care you know all kinds of things\nThe big thing that people like that work for these biotech companies is the time off I talked to a gal\nAnd she's working at a you know it's a small biotech no money so they don't have the gym memberships and the other part yeah but what they do is at Christmas the we Christmas they just shut down for the entire week a whole week now and they're going to do it now\nNow for the July Fourth week and it doesn't count towards your time off so you get your four weeks of vacation time plus your personal days or whatever [laughter] um but you have two weeks it you know in the middle of the year at the end of the year where you get a full vacation week that you don't have to use your vacation I that if you're raising a family\nSo it's a very valuable\nFor and it it it's one of those things where if if you look at it there's a lot of industries where they can't do that anything customer service based and you can't do that can be financial services there can't do it but for something like this where all you're doing as a whole bunch of research you can coordinate research schedules you you you get you can do that kind of thing so it's it's really interesting that these businesses\nAre kind of pushing the envelope as far as hey you know we can't necessarily pay people more will give you all kinds of different perks or they might still be able to offer significant benefit\nA lot of money pouring into that sector there as you look at their company\nYou know there'll be trading at three bucks and then a couple of weeks later they're trading at twenty dollars a share because they got some kind of FDA all it takes is like some kind of a drug approval of the opposite way too though that's the problem yeah oh they do ... you can make a lot of money enemy can lose an awful lot of money now\nSpeaking of which Medicare premiums are going up modestly next year unless you make a lot of money you see that if you make a lot of money your Medicare premiums are going to be over a thousand bucks a year\n[noise] yeah it's it's something where\nUh the the part B premium so which this year have been\nA hundred and thirty four dollars a year I'm a month they're going up to a hundred and thirty five fifty so it's only a modest it's a really small increase and I don't know what the reasons for that I don't know if they've been better at cracking down on fraud I don't know if they've found you know better reimbursement rates to keep prices down\nBut that is a really small increase for Medicare premiums and what that means is that people who are getting Social Security bumps meaning everyone who gets that two point eight percent bump on Social Security so what's that work out to about forty bucks a month yeah we're going to be able to keep most of that now\nWhat is being because there there have been so many years where either people have gotten no bump for Social Security or it's been all eaten up by increases in Medicare premiums\nAnd this is really good ... again\nYou know let's put it this way tow truck if you're living on your Social Security you're working as well you you're not living you can't pay your bills in New England and live on the air whether you're eighty or you get New England\nBut there's lots of parts of the country where people live on is their Social Security there's people in New England to do it to you know they're not easy they're not living inside one twenty eight is my guess\nNow they're living in subsidized housing [noise]\nNo you you can live if you look if you're out and you know uh Lancaster or something like that you can you can live cheaply out there you know it's it's just we get so focused on okay here's what things cost in the city there's a whole bunch of people don't live anywhere near city\nShe hit a modest increase in your Medicare part B in a pretty good bump in your Social Security and other bumping Social Security left in the January check it out to\nBe a I Believe so yes it's and so they they pretty much tell you right now just so that you can plan for it um but that is going to be starting in twenty Nineteen so in January\nAnd just as an added bonus here a sixty five year old American male in two thousand and Eighteen\nIs expected to live another Nineteen point two years I start to see the older you get the more you start focusing in on the SAT so yeah if a if a sixty five year old has another Nineteen years I figure I must have another twenty twenty five\n... that means that if you make it to sixty five\nPretty good chance you're making it to eighty four promised\nBinary you either do or you don't ... well there's no middle ground you know you can't get halfway gets it you either do or you don't you know it's not like oh I get to Seventy five in it you're done then\nThere is it how about women sixty five year old American female in twenty eight teams gets an extra Twenty one point six years\nIn eighty six point six years old and\nYou know what we've seen over the last forty years as this uh outlines here is that life expectancy is particular for those who are older have increased somewhat here a lot of the gains that we've picked up in life expectancy over the twentieth century or primarily due to improved\nA medical care around the first few years of life you know it used to be you know if you go back to the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds pretty good chance of dying and your first five years of life you know it was pretty common and that's part of the reason why people at such big families pay they knew a couple of weren't going to make it\nWhat you see now is we're starting to get better at improving quality of life for older folks and so you are seeing longer life expectancy is even if you're already in your fifties sixties and seventies\nWell that ah you know the it's all good news but imagine the strain that's going to put on Medicare and Social Security ... which they weren't calculated to last year when they these programs are designed you're supposed to be dead by the time you're Seventy five\nMost times you were you know is it just ... they're not built to last in a world where people retire in their sixties and then a retired for twenty to\nTwenty five years they will nobody talking about fixing them or are there no no one wants to be ah our generation you're is lately ... our our generation is just saying\nYeah we'll let the millennials handle that one of the doubt still hanging on to modest gain the Dallas up two points ... fifty six points and we get you a

from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan questions today from President Trump to the king of Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a reporter at the Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nMm I don't think that's happened doesn't see I don't think that's happening China sees an existential threat to being tied to the dollar and they want to move away from it\nYou still love chick fillet [noise]\nSet a question Tucker that's quite a desire never been we've\nBeen over this I don't have any near me that ... minute drive twenty five miles to go to one\nYou should you should I was in your life I was looked at noon every I was looking at chick fillet and I said to myself why would somebody\nBy a McDonald's franchise as opposed to a chick fillet or why would somebody by a subway franchise subway franchise is more expensive to buy\nThan a chick fillet franchise you can get a sense you can get a chick fillet franchise for like twenty grand\nBut you know what there's twenty thousand apple yes it's harder than getting into Harvard it's it's unbelievable twenty thousand people apply to buy a chick flick a you know how many they give out a little less than a hundred yeah so it's something going on\nYou have a less than half a percent chance of actually being approved to to buy one of these franchise\nSo they're looking for somebody that they can mold and they they also don't sell you you can't say well I Want to buy all the chick fillet franchises in New England for all the trick for what I you know you can buy\nOne on unlike McDonald's which now is looking for people to buy more than one McDonalds if you go on their website and take a look at their franchise got their franchisee guidelines they want people who can by five ten Fifteen twenty they want but I mean all you're not\nOperating them great like chick fillet is saying yeah we'll let you in the door for twenty grand yep right but you have to be there every day you've got to hire the people you've got to make sure grease the customer like if you own a chick fillet franchise it's not you're not operating it from the sea sweet no on the floor\nThey they want you to be active but one of the key things that when you go through a what they detail that they want\nOne of the biggest things they don't want you have any other active business ventures I Want you to be all in on this franchise and I'll tell you one of the you know I talk about how good the food is a check for ... again I I Love the Chicken Little just something about like I Love the chicken\nThis customer service that I have gotten there not only is better than any other fast food restaurant I've seen\nIt rivals some actual you know sit down dining establishment in terms of the overall quality that you get you get managers were literally managers walking around picking up trash saying hey can I get you anything did eat ice and that you get people coming up to help you more often than I've ever seen and I think\nWhen I talk about you know the chick flick experienced and why I think it's better the food's one thing but customer service is something that's been largely left out of the last Twenty years just about everywhere because it all gets sent you know to think about any customer service ... you've had whether it's with whether it's they'll whoever it is it's generally not good\nI don't I I'm going to disagree with you there you go to an American restaurant\nAnd you are generally going to get\nPretty good service for I guess we came back ... we were in Paris for a week you want to talk about bad service\nTry visiting Paris ... what was bad about it maybe they knew you were American ... well maybe not about it ... the the waiters do they don't get much in the way it tips right so they make you know Fifteen twenty euros an hour\nBut because people don't tip for reasons don't tip\n'em they the you get just God awful ...\nWhat was ... was it slowed did they not bring the rate like what we actually had added on\nIt usually just slow it wasn't like the a lot of times people say all the furniture and they weren't they were very nice but it was just like you you could go literally twenty minutes with your Empty Plates and then you're in front of you and I when I'm done my new I Want my plate gone I think part of that just did a cultural different\nI I was just about to say that check I think in America everything's fast paced and get in get out and over there are just way more laid\nBack I Want you to spend like two or three hours eating\nRight I Know well I I Would I Would take American service over a European\nI sat and I think to today's the day boys by the way I just Google a chick fillet near me and there's one in data which I was not aware of the U.S which is right on the way home so you're going to go and I think I might\nBut they they if that answers the question as to why\nPeople don't buy ... how much does manager make if you if you buy one of these franchises what kind of money going to make are we talking a manager or the ... or the ... you will you go out ... like really you're only paying twenty grand to get the franchise so really what they're doing is they're hiring managers [noise]\nYou're you're buying the opportunity to be a manager for ... for chick\nFillet so I can do some research okay based on what I'm finding initially okay and this is a from someone I I find this on line this from someone who is a former marketing director at chick fillet\nUm but it looks like if you talk about the base revenue that you get plus the profit sharing and so forth\nIt looks like the low end is about a hundred thousand a year or the high end is well north of three fifty so my guess is most people are probably between two hundred and three hundred a year when it's all said and done a good living go early and and you don't have to work Sundays [noise]\nNo and and I wonder if you get free chick fillet oh I'm ready to let me tell you that there's some value to
