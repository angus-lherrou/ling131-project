much once you get one you have when I'm just wondering how many of these there'll be able to continue to sell going forward\nThat's a great question I think one at least I've found once you you buy

these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate for you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story\nHere what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky who sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord bent a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the held uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll got\nKind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer\nFirst lady Michelle Obama one of the most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats or the call to arms are the most popular in a respected Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky\nThere is at twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and Trump or first my so\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible the Democrats again only ... seats falling short of winning control\nThat would leave the Republicans nominate with a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate there's even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try ...\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [laughter] [noise] you people on the left don't understand\nUnity when you see if you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand along side Republican

vote ... warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent [laughter]\n\nMy point is again do not\nFor for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispirited or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... ... up the turnout ... up interest and they're really slumber and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News for a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have ... knew the interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote\nThis is not what we're supposed to happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand sixteen as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of a a convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprising guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press the Trump quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American ... says the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish\nAlso from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... comes or attempting to sway American opinion a head of the elections\nOf a

Ford for her allegations what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice they don't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving\nImmigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were\nEager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm On four of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they have to do was change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christiana unimportant it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America\nThat's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law\nWhen they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe ass not by you in fact\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on on on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's a Joe Biden ruled it\nDemocrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nAfter all is in the whole show our forty minutes I mean it's great 'cause like I listen to it on the way home from war because her any commercials

to the ... that that's where would you read about the high wins in the race that's where the brunt of it is now\nThis storm is so strong that it's bad as you get away from me I but the real bad stuff is the I decide well I think I saw thirty miles or maybe not no it's not that big now I'm looking at not that the smaller it is the more intense usually\n[noise] um [noise] and\nAs usual it's the

doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of

[noise] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments at a base of liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quota came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre set the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle exhort eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nIt seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nDry ... with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word and what not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nWas a labor laws and um when\nYou look at what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern\nEra in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in\nHonor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nAlready know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be network\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer\nStage four and here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to met issue here where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our panels\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time\nThese are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is Dr King\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right

or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that\nPeople at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrat sponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way they've found a way to recycle and keep lock her up

Democrats\n\nYou don't hand matches do an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it thrown right back at

little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know if you got any feedback from any other top rallies that you get feedback from\nOr what about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were
