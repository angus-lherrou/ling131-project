T. A. R. at Comcast dot net\nFor the John McKay show Youth Radio Ninety five W. H. D. J. A. five WICK [noise]\n\n\nWe're back ladies and gentlemen let's go right to Laurie and high which Hi Laurie thanks for joining me\nHello Don how do you\nWrite a woman was calling about is um I normally I I not listening to the radio on Saturday 'cause I'm at work but I'm off today and um I I guess\nAll I heard so far is it that I don't really help to bring people together at all I mean it's like you know part of the problem is that you can't talk to each other and\nUm you know I Know that sounds like everything you said about any like Alex ... negative or I'm\nLaurie if I if I may say I was a Democrat for years but we've tried this those of us that we're a moderate and conservative Democrats we tried working with\nThe other side they don't want the it's ... this is why I'm saying I Know what I'm Talking about I've ... I've been with top politicians for thirty plus years\nAnd I have seen the change is no longer acceptance of the other side we if we had a a a Mitt Romney who couldn't have been a nice guy we've had other good people let became Republican candidates and they was vilified by the press\nThey are ... they're still being bad bumps\nIt doesn't matter Laurie took part of the ... the leadership it's not all Democrats and I'm Sorry\nAnd I apologize to you and others who do sip this but they control of the Democratic party I Know it's controlled by mean spirited people who are tied to the media\nAnd this is why there is no working if they don't get their way you are going to pay\nAnd I'm Sorry to have to say that\nBut I Am not a Republican I'm not either one I Can't stand politicians right now in general and I feel bad for the good people the good young men and women I did it I ran for office state rep\nAnd those people are now being discouraged from running which is another part of the leftist movement they want to have no one run\nFor office that isn't controlled by them any one that's a conservative that runs as a Democrat is doomed now is that fair\n\nAre you still live ... ... it's hard to ... or\nYou're just changed our what did you get off the phone or some something as a matter with your phone can you try and [noise] I ... a highly ... just change did you change the phone\nOr oh I got out of that so yeah it's\nOkay are you talking All right\nI I was just saying I Would like to hear some something struck it on your show something as it is that like I say get bad now\nWhile you don't listen do you like you said you work most Saturday So you don't listen to every Saturday there are plenty of positive things in life you my this is Steven knocked on but like you\nOr I Love to engage people in civil discourse and I think the problem is that you can't have that anymore you're exactly right\nBut the ... you have to admit that there is no negativity perhaps on this show because we are reporting\nTo the best of our ability what is going on and when you and I'm an independent so I'm not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat but I Would tell you this honestly when you saw the judge Kavanaugh hearings and you see the type of people\nThat would go up to senators doors and bang on their doors and scream at them to vote him down\nAnd when you would see a senator who I had respect for Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut saying to judge Kavanaugh\nWe need the truth we need you to be honest this is from a man who for Fifteen Years in the state of Connecticut lied about his service in Vietnam now when we say that\nThat's not being negative that's reporting the fact she did tell people he was actually in Vietnam and he withdrew from the race because he they found out that he never was in Vietnam\nSo I Wish you would listen more\nAnd you won't hear all negativity you you'll hear some we'll hear some positive stuff\nTo Laurie and while saying well go ahead well if I can just say something else ...\nI I Would say you know what I mean there are fanatic in every group\nAnd you know put everybody in the same pot is not going to help you know I happened to turn on Sean Hannity's show the other night and that's not normally a show that I listen to but they had ... and a place with playing for\nMe and I agree with everything he said all\nWent out he was before and the mode of any signs of bringing people together and you know ... and you know right at me after she stopped talking with raising her as well and then he immediately turned back on the political\nBecome one of those one hundred million just remember the strength in numbers\n\nDo the math and only takes a willing hot and the fed up so God Bless America and shine your light\nOn her now so you that loved Obama and most of it came from being idolized by the media\nAnd because he happened to be black the first black president which was fine with me just like I'd vote for a woman tomorrow\nBut let's look at the racket\nIn Nineteen fifty to President Truman to stab lift one day a year as a quote national day of prayer close poke\nIn Nineteen eighty eight President Reagan designated the first Thursday in May of each year as the national day of prayer\nIn June of two thousand and seven then presidential candidate but rock Obama declared that quote the usa was no longer a Christian nation fact that's what he said\nSeventy three percent admit to being Christian but that doesn't matter President Obama\nDecided that we will no longer a Christian nation and he got away with it why because the left control them then\nAnd do now then President Obama canceled the twenty first annual national day of prayer ceremony\nLook it up\nHeld at the White House under the rules of quote not wanting to offend anyone close quote I guess he didn't mind be offending the Christians like me maybe you got away with it on September\nTwenty fifth two thousand nine from for A M until seven PM a national day of prayer was held for the Muslim religion on Capitol Hill right beside the White House there were over fifty thousand Muslims in D.C that day\nAnd that grace doesn't make liberals feel so wonderful castigate and eliminate a Christian celebration of national day of prayer\nBut when you get fifty thousand Muslim you're doing a wonderful wonderful thing doesn't matter when Christians are offended we obviously don't count anymore in that group then he sat and encouraging schools to\nTeach the choir ran for extra credit in schools but they couldn't talk about the Bible God or salute the American flag member that one I'm a Wal Mart you couldn't say merry Christmas you remember that\nGives me the direction this country is headed should strike fear in the heart of every Christian especially knowing that the Muslim religion just for one believes that Christians cannot be converted\nShould be annihilated\nIs there a discussion there my previous caller\nHarvard graduate Iraq Obama write this down when this election is coming up with thirty days or so here's what happened on January fourteenth the first\nTop income tax bracket one from thirty five percent to thirty nine point six percent top income payroll tax went from thirty seven point four percent two fifty two point two percent here this\nLady's Jim you work as this isn't about millionaires this is about people\nFour years ago your top income payroll tax went up Fifteen Percent capital gains tax went from Fifteen Percent to twenty eight percent this is the ... the Obama\nAdministration\nThese taxes were all past some of the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare this is not them to do with the help\nRemember this fact if you have any money for Democrats want your money they want to spend it on trips they want to spend it on it'll legals living in Boston how can any of you with the brain vote Democrat because you don't like Don McCabe egg\nIs that your rationale they don't like Donald Trump yeah because I don't say anything good\n[laughter]\nGot one Republican voted to pass those tax is not one remember this one this election comes up in so many people I hear from all the time a lot of women a lot of women when I'm Out having breakfast dinner I\nI'm that's what keeps me going Steve and by the way forgive me I didn't mean to shut you dial a on that ... thing yeah\nHe didn't shut me down but I just think it's ... yeah I think it's terribly wrong when you read something that I Love and it's beautiful and it was written two hundred years ago and it's about a guy because one\nAbout what man man not women men notice it'd be man right so don't change if the person I didn't you did I\nWas just talking to match you did absolutely you change the word to person instead of just man when you read it to be politically\nCorrect the end I said person well ... the whole beginning with the man okay we've got callers anyway it doesn't matter just any without doing because I mean you're going to pitch or how do whatever I chose to do so don't you know better than that\nI'm going to do exactly what I Want a government as a as you go to a club and I just got a text from women saying about a check I don't know what yeah [laughter]\nNo vote jak right hey bother you they allowed\nYes I Am I Hope I'm not interrupting again

out whether I'm a St Louis oh what was the other one cost us no go ahead Bob\nWell the reason I call though and that lady that called little while ago uh talking about negativity and I felt bad for her because she obviously isn't totally aware of what's going on around here\nAnd a good example is going to pay it legit today a new poll quickly run by ABC News and a walk impose more painful disapprove of Kavanaugh's confirmation does support it no I don't know who these people are talking till\nThey ever call you Bob I always say I have a young call my\nFriends that voted for Trump yup never get any calls but now nobody supports Kavanaugh yep it'll come on ... ... they can't\nStop beating a dead horse you ever notice liberals cannot stop beating a dead horse that's their problem\nBut you know in two thousand and sixteen yeah when Trump was running against Hillary uh-huh\nHe would show up at rallies and see twenty five thirty thousand people and then when he would go back\nTo his home they would say geez I don't know that his kids would say er millennia would say\nYou know I don't know it doesn't look good and he would say ... I don't understand this twenty five thousand people now since October this is only what the thirteenth of October yeah\nIn the last Thirteen Days the man is Don eight rallies e Seventy two he's not an eight rallies they run at least almost two hours every rally he's got one he did one last night he's got one tonight he's got five next week the next week after that and the next week after that and tonight he's going to be in Kansas\nThere's gonna be forty thousand people that would be like Paul McCartney showing up\nAnd what the Democrats don't get it\nIs these people if he can galvanize them to come out just like you did in two thousand and sixteen it's not going to be anything short of assume nominee for the Republicans and and they don't get this so when you say\nAbout these polls about Kavanaugh at all these people who\nGo to these rallies you always said look what a great job we did we got cabin are on the Supreme Court they go crazy last night there was like twenty thousand people\nKnow Bob go ahead\nYou're not even counting the people that can't get it is\nThat's right no you're right that's right that's right well and how 'bout how 'bout that they haven't yet I didn't get to it it's in my notes can you imagine and I've been told a by some people I Know in high echelons of the Democratic party they're not happy with the\nClintons going to go on a tour what are they gonna do and they have fifty people show up or a hundred and fifty or to well I Know you and I know what ABC and CNN will they'll fill lonely the forefront and rows of five rows make it look like there's a mob there\nHave you heard the prices of the tickets it's unbelievable they ... they were in la la land she and amazed especially\nThe minimum prices Seventy dollars yup and I heard that my son lives like seven hundred dollars you know like in their right mind would say that to go see the book\n[noise]\n[noise]\nUses squeezes mayor for terrifying attractions one location designed to get\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find your loan them you're right\nCall a civilian will get started\nThe Asian Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nThis audio is for your review and now for broadcast Internet posting or distribution to other ... copy of the air quality original and as a property by our media Washington DC\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's go family cared dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from optimal health\nCare um mine was a bull frog\nAnd so many Democrats boom right let's go to Jim ... who's been\nWaiting patiently and match B welcome to the ...\nGone hey listen I just want to say on the cause a few a yes or no\nThink what she should try and do it I mean she's listening to you and at at times you can be\n... I'm In Missouri\nOh you know no no no I Am not in radio on the same overbearing said abrasive not racist yeah oh okay yeah [laughter] and I think that Sean Hannity\nIs even worse at times you know you\nKnow I Know I understand what he's trying to do but he's not very um respect people I Would suggest that she listens to Rush Limbaugh or does does\nShe can do with how much do you mean you're working you sound like she's a working woman and she's trying to figure out I don't understand that I\nThink I understand where she she's trying to figure things out in that ... point watched just trying to figure out so you know Sean Hannity or not we can be a break now as well as well as me as well as the evil there\nBut Sean ... but Sean Hannity just so you know is the highest rated by twice the amount of people he has six million people every night tuning into him six million a night\nAnd ... that's ... if you take MSNBC and CNN and add them together\nThey don't reach three million people he reaches six million people tonight so he's being abrasive only to the liberals but not to the conservatives because they love him and they watch um I'm not sticking up for Sean Hannity but I'm just telling\nThem well you know what what you mean what he needs to do we need to deal\nI think it's the say\nEverybody's trying to figure out what's going on and he has to be at a little left brain that's all I'm\nSaying I ... I went back home\nI can only speak for myself Jim and again I don't know how old you are and it doesn't matter except for one thing I can speak for myself and my\nFast fading seventies\nWe've tried the other way I said that to the caller and you know we're frustrated I identify with him I don't deny what you're saying and I know sometimes I'll even say it on the air I've gone off the rails sometimes\nBut the frustration is because we're a lone wolf up there\nOn Cape Cod we uh\n... I Am an ad Lambert thank God they have him in the mornings but I mean I Am even worse I guess because I Am very opinionated but I ... I justify my anger\nIn my motives for one thing and secondly I speak from experience I Know what I'm Talking about and I'm so frustrated with college like that\nWho don't even understand what's been try we try to get along with the other side they won't tolerate a gym now what are you supposed to do fold your hands like too many Americans are doing and let them have their way that's why we're in the mess we're in and now I think\nWhat I'm trying to say if you express your opinion\nIn around that oh well I think I'm and you know a fire and all that you know when a joke to any I I I play our I'm All right ...\nThanks Jim okay let's go to Bob thanks for holding a ... in Columbus and\nGood luck Donnie\nHello Bob a boy\nGood morning what kind of Irish men are you down and you don't you know that St Brendan discovered America had nine hundred years before Columbus\nI'm sure he did ...

then he tied in with you know other people like Muslims or people who want to change our way of living why our power but you have to really I felt you know why would it doesn't make any sense\nTo not want to keep it strong I mean why don't we get in the country and yet it doesn't make\nIt kept the it does when you realize one let's take the real problem is we don't have term limits\nSecondly the power of the press support every minority issue there is\nThey will brutalized any candidate Republican or a president who stands up for the country's values if it means they have to go against illegal aliens coming into this country even it means you have to go against a gay group that wants to go to a disrupt\nAnd uh get attention to a a parade that was always historically a celebration of St Patrick's Day these politicians lack coverage they lack it or the ... the willingness to lose cat\nIt's not rocket science they will do anything to win and now we have Republicans it used to be

I was in its current why that one doesn't have the courage or in the ... side and that everybody should be describing to have the courage to report conservative values\nHelp if you ... you got to look at the core and when you eliminate God you eliminate the uh the ten commandments\nYou eliminate the seven deadly sins it sounds corny I almost can't believe John McCain saying because I'm a center and I haven't been the greatest in ... and I mean I've been I'm not saying I was a bad person but I'm just saying\nIt means more to me no sitting this radio and acknowledge\nThe future maybe it's because I'm old\nBut I mean people just when you minimize church attendance by social behaviors and social articles\nBad mouth thing a belief in God which is what I was trying to read about a president's standing up and eliminating a national day of prayer and yet having one for Muslims Kathy ... do you do what do you need to do you want to figure out how wrong that is\nWell you know you don't need

whatever reason so like I don't want to be like\nMe as I mentioned when we were coming in the dorm this morning I got a fairly new vehicle in the I got a crack in the windshield so I had the glass changed out\nAnd when they changed it out they didn't steal something properly and we get a heavy rainstorm I Want to come and inside the cap\nNow I don't think about that on a sunny day of driving

could it does in so many people\nHave a a a a personal uh\nAversion to turn it on the ... people all the time yeah last until November Eighteenth before I turn my right but if it's really cold November Eighteenth you end up calling somebody in the middle of the night right right you're\nGoing for the get his real Booker records how long has lost its cage that he was just so\nYeah you know you're not talking about people running it all day just turn it on for an hour or two and just see if it's running and everything's heating up and and then shut it off again until you want to ... them do you want a mentally prepare for heating system since\nThe majority of your problems are going to be the first time you turn it on rent any any mechanical device right yeah and you'd be surprised how many are just a an emergency switch that got turned off some time during the summer mhm and\nThen you get the kind of call at midnight no he ... yeah people switch or something so yeah I be proactive we go to the the phone lines are starting to get active here are folks who want to give us a call can reach us a five a wait\nSeven seven five nine Ninety five and a Tom was the er the first

you're the one I saw that with the record in the car\nA [laughter] that's not somebody else but the only one right at the\nYeah the coffee cup lined up onto the draft [laughter] at you\nWhen they had to do yesterday 'cause it you know as as it was part of it again and say oh I got to go run some errands and it's pouring out like I grabbed a waterproof table cloth and I brought south as putting it on the seat because last time it was driven under the seat oh and then it smell like like you know stale sneakers and all that into a couple of\nDays to get out [laughter] [laughter] yeah yeah I I'm just too busy to get this stuff taken care of but it dries up and get the result they're right around ... exactly so it wasn't as bad yesterday but no that wasn't in the in the rain 'cause that was somebody else to talk\nAbout starting your uh appliances up or the the the\nLike the front of my kid worked in a heating and air conditioning company over in Brockton if there is the first cool day he's with probably about ... ... no he is battery yes that are the customers\nYou need to replace your battery idea terms that every place that they all say yes and then he goes out and find out the battery\nYeah that's very common yeah but the price\nIs so that goes a hundred dollar bills in the service called just to change it better you know get when you had to be proactive in check that out\nYeah one of those things you want to do you want to check up and everything else and like okay you thought you did you like the battery Cal people like you just said no dry it out but it or not but by the medicine makes you a big way to make sure the air band comes on or\nThe third way bump with coming on\nAnd then get shut it off right on the air conditioning they have an air conditioning unit I'll buy\nAt the time you want to do I need to cover that for the winter\nIt that's um\nIt's not necessary but you can and if you do yeah there is a a particular type of cover that\nOnly goes down over the unit and it leaves the bottom two inches open so that the air can circulate inside if you completely covered if you wrap it ah with with a a a tarp a plastic or something like that entire uptight all that's going to do was hold moisture in there\nAnd it and it's going to be even worse for it they they are engineered to be outdoors or what you're going to protect it from\nIs if you have overhanging pine trees or oak trees and ... a lot of leaf litter or pine needles will get inside that you're protected from that if you're in a ... a waterfront home salt spray it'll protected from that\nOkay the other question I have talked about pine needles by needles getting in there and it gets on the bottom where the ban in ... is that something in ... when it comes to do check up\nTypically yes they should be if if they look in there and they see that the we poles and the bottom of that unit it's been plugged you got to clear them he also got to clear all the bark mulch and all the other stuff that can accumulate around the base of the outside\nSo that that so that water can freely flow out of it doesn't ... oyster\nRight but you know being on top that doesn't bother me not at all on a John I'm sure you could do a great job\nWell thank you Tom I ain't got how many hours to go I should have the confidence you having me [laughter] thank you absolutely [laughter] I think you guys have a great weekend for the next ...\nOr like\nThat's how we do it folks you've got the questions comments glad to take 'em at five oh wait seven seven five nine nine

that at your windshield that'll all that you get that properly\nThat is true if I Do that I'm I'm I'm concerned that I Will procrastinate\nIn and leave out that way [laughter] I don't know how old is that the skyline on the roof count and that's how we ended up having to do with some shipping tape on it [laughter] no I mean\nI'm not going to jump off line and listen and appreciate it thank you\nSo I guess I'll take the first one I'm I'm assuming he has a manual generator gasoline it sounds like because he and he wants to properly cook it up\nThat's the key properly I don't know it's more than just the ... pointing into yeah it's more than just a ... plug into um they make these generator manual switches um [noise]\nThat mount next year electrical panel they come into sizes are you\nAnd there's the ... circuit and tenth circuit size um [noise] and what that switch does is when you plug your generator into your house\nUm that switch separates generator power from St power so that when your power comes back on you don't have a clash of two different power sources um [noise]\nIt's the only way to do it right it's the only way I Will hook up somebody's generator to recall a device that saw a manual transfer sweat\nI'll tell you yeah she is usually located next to the electric ... yep mountain\nRight next to the electrical boxes and you can pick you you got to size is the sixth circuit or a tenth circuit and you can\nYou know you can pick ten circuits Saturday a panel to run your house obviously we focus on the more important stuff first year you know you refrigeration you eat\nIf you have a well uh we want to put your well on it if that's your source of water and then he is he have a handful of circuits to pick from there um\nI've gotten so many calls from people um my neighbor down the street back fades is generated through the drier outlet and re does is\nYou know back feeds the ban on and I just refuse to do that because the last thing on anybody's mind when the power goes out is shutting off the main break\nUm you know that that might make more sense\nTrauma right of insulation were you thinking of using were you do a blown in\nA in a bad type of thing is just send the cellar and um you know under the in the cellar on the shores for the uh downstairs\nOr your first for you so you're you're aspirin stealing your basements down a gym in Iraq is the I mean since their exposes a wise to upgrade to this point in time or just just because they go into the wall Harry we can get out on my hand I mean\nI've upgraded a couple of houses like that it's a ton of work as I say if you're leaving the walls up\nIt's a lot of work to do a complete rewire um [noise] 'cause you can't just do half you got to do the whole thing you can say on the section I'll do and then leave a restaurant and too because there's no really good way to terminate it\nUm\nAnd that's the issue with the ...\nBut yeah just call your local inspector even the building inspector can probably give you a better answer then I can uh I've never had that asked me before but I've been in many addicts where there's been blown in insulation covering knob and to wire and um [noise]\nUm but as far as the fiberglass insulation I'm not sure about [noise]\nAlright well very good well thank you very much you have a nice\nWeek Hi Tom thank you thank you yeah twice to you know to be cautious franchise now that I gotta go Kevin Call the local inspector and see what he has to say let's say\nYou're you've seen it done yeah and but but whether it meets code is one and then you get your insurance companies of all to if I think my cellphone and I don't know who's going to put the insulation are they now why of all if something happens\nYou know down the road a fire caused by overeating wires can already insulation who's liability on such such a so\nI've had customers reach out to me because they're they changed insurance companies and they found they had not been too when they won't charm [laughter] you know they changed not into the same lines as the federal ... you know they don't have a higher runs for them right it's one of those hot buttons and they don't want to go there\nExactly we have a gym calling all away from the ... way over that big pond there to the islands so let's go to a school to Jim Jim welcome to the handyman hotline\nGood afternoon or I have a very simple question to ask you um I have a one stone a gas cottage and or or you have to wonder why from when I was younger but I haven't been doing the last couple of years\nI had a a permanent and a phrase put in a a a base sport and\nUh I had a phrase up a couple of years ago or so they are former I I had went to ride my bike last year a suggested that I Believe the gas furnace on or below a guardian wintertime or that they\nGet trained regular water from the system\nBut leave the furnace on and I I'm not familiar with gas burner back well would you recommend leaving the gas furnace on over ... over the winter\nYes yes it it it it'll\nIt'll be better for the equipment that's for sure I mean obviously it's going to cost you a little\nBit more money um but\nIt'll do two things it'll ensure that the inside of your house stays up\nAbove the dew point um\nThe inside of your house can react just like the outdoors when we get temperature changes\nUh you know like the last week you you you would you walk outside and they do on the grass well when the temperature goes up and down\nI'm inside your house you run the risk of getting condensation inside your house\nAnd you could potentially ... end up with ... with some must he smells and ... and so forth I don't just keeping it at fifty five degrees will keep it above the dew point even fifty just\nJust um ... exercises the system the pumps all that you've got like all in the system which should be checked every five years for ph to make sure it doesn't begin to he said if I\nAm not a part of that question of fact I had a prominent Adam ... and the system but I'm not a a a non toxic type\nYeah that's quite all I was told that that uh and afraid or it's not good to have in there for some reason but your opinion on that as\nWell as long as you check it like I said every ... every five years have somebody checked the the the freezing point and the ph of it as long as the ph is relatively neutral and the phrase point is reasonable\nThere's there's no problem\nOkay well thank you very much for the information ...\nGreat Jim thanks for calling us all a whale from Nantucket appreciate you listening in your call or have a great day [noise]\nI get by without those words of wisdom you've people German diesel old is she\nThat that's always a question with with seasonal property owners yeah\nIn the new or the house the more important I feel it is to to keep the temperature up when you when you were a way\nThat makes us I've not heard of it explain from the dew point perspective before there's been some arguments about you know ... you know getting cold and trying out and things move in and\nSo yeah that that is another another victory over the or the woodwork paints and matching attraction constantly and yep temperature you're keeping a fairly consistent with your\nThe temperatures and the and the moisture levels et cetera so that makes sense\nSo as um again if if you want to just faith in our conversation today are all subject matters dealing with the home are open they don't just have to deal with the heating system or air conditioning or your electrical but the anything to do with the home will be glad to uh uh entertain your your questions your comments you can reach us a five away seven seven five\nNine Ninety five just like Peter did who's calling from your arm is Peter welcome to the handy man hauling\nAfternoon how are you good I can help you today well how can I help you I was interested in that conversation about insulating over the you know to wiring Oh yes and most of my professional career down here's been anti houses bottom knob to wiring\nI'm sure that you've come across a lot of the Mickey Peter for isn't it amazing how much of that is still around like\nWell it is yeah it's it's a yeah pardon the expression shocked me to see how much right now when you think about up and to open the one hand it's very safe because right was negative are separate yep this is a space separate and there's no chance of a problem across that that know\nHow actually considered the the safest wire in math than\nIt is yeah it is right or wherever you don't cover it right\nYou know unless it's in a in a wall cavity space between ... and the wall surface over if you you don't cover it with anything that's going on a contract with both watch\nRight right yeah I don't think any insurance company if they detect that will cover\nNo and I was just having that conversation with John ah during the break is um yeah insurance company if they find that you have not been to ... you had changing that wiring and we're looking for a new insurance company um some\nOf the major reason that was always explain that I heard was that if particularly for use bad insulation if that bad installation become sufficiently damp you've now established a problem right because you got a layer of moisture in direct contact both\nPositive and negative lunch right and you can't find it well you you find out what you see the smoke on the line for\nYou know that's right that's right yeah but it's funny 'cause I've been in many addicts and uh they blow and the insulation and they cover everything\nThey cover everything\nYeah well let loose material blown in is one thing right that's that's just a problem and that's that should be done right that the newer installation like the open so and the clothes so far I don't know\nI personally think that that should be a problem particularly the clothes so because it's simply cannot absorb any moisture right\nAh it's it's completely in our\nUh but people people have to you know they should make sure that girl lecture contractor checks with the local inspector because as you know there are things like direct contact lights mhm there's a reason for that right there is you have to make sure that whatever you want to be in contact with the wiring and or your installation is approved\nRight yeah and that's what I pointed towards them well you know he needs to call the local local inspectors and find out exactly how he wants to handle it\nUh yeah I'm pretty sure it's not approved right for patterns anyway\nUm the carrier the Olympics um\nPossibly train I'm not intimately familiar with train but they are what I look at it knows is they they use ... ah parts that you can readily get off the shelf\nSo you're down times ... gonna be next to nothing I can service most of those manufacturers right out of the truck with the ... and the motives that I have one hand I don't have to go with a Williams special order parts or subscribe to a stocking program through the manufacturer\n\nWhile you made me happy because I I agree with everything that you know when you can go where the standard high efficiency motor regular motive for the blower at supply house because they they go and uh\nYou know and I I liked the idea of the major branches in mentioning because I Know even list a randomly have you can't even oil the motor without taking the whole cage a pot of the world stage there's there are no to no way to get in there and uh\nYou know it's just like what a piece of junk and when you mentioned the major brands like carrier and a lot acts and stuff like that um\nYeah you just reassure me and my sanity\n[laughter] good right now [laughter] otherwise they didn't come out and said oh by the young people in there for a fry it in a reputable matter of fact it's been around for a while and makes\nIt translated that kinda good okay thank you you made me happy thank you You're welcome thanks for the call John appreciate it Bye bye\nSo tell me do it folks you if you've got some input you want to put Bob friendly to the chest or even given earlier myself give us a holler with

Ninety five WMGK\nLatest from ABC News maybe feel\nPresident Trump says he's worried that you would lose an arms deal by sanctioning Saudi Arabia if that country murdered an American citizen journalists I don't want to\nNow I always sell I sell both and I install both um I always try to find out what the best fit is for the particular person um\nOlder woman and I'm\nYou know I was like John doesn't want to get out to the garage in hawk generate yeah what her in and right right\nI mean you know even though you get a generator with the ... you still have to lift it and you still have to we'll it outside the garage 'em and you still have to pour gasoline into it and you still have to um\nMost generate most manuals have a battery starchy it'd be fined starting it but you still have to plug it in and you still have to get on the basement and the dark with a flashlight and switch a couple of switches so\nIt doesn't sound like that's probably the best fit for you um the better fate would be to go fully automatic um\nAnd fully automatic uses one of two um um sources of energy to run a natural gas in propane [noise] we'd prefer to run it on natural gas um\n[noise] so that you don't have to deal with anything about putting propane tanks and getting their tanks filled all the time and all that natural gas generally should be available on the street and you may already have a natural gas meter at your house\nIf that's the case then natural gas standby generator for you would be a benefit now of course it's more expensive to install\nIt's probably two or three times the cost 'em\nAnd um\nI could come over and I could check out your house [noise] check out what would be the best fit do some calculations to find the proper size generator for you and then we can take it from there\nIn ... which which prompts the question to your contract number I'd neglect to give up\nOh yes it was from yeah I can be read seven five eight four to eight seven thousand and actually I've been very busy doing generators this last month or two um you know with all these storms going on and [noise]\nWinters right around the corner and the winter we had last year the last several years um we've lost power quite a bit of time um and people are just sick and tired of being without power for two or three days\nA gym windows so if someone like Joan elects to go where they stand by system to automatic fear and you have a gas connection gas company have to get involved I mean if if she's got gas for the house already um you can't do all that yourself you need when a plumber drawn from guest piping\nRight right so so I have a plumber that works with me when I install the standby generator so the plumbing aspect of it will be included in the price of me installing a standby generator so you can give a package deal and she don't have to worry about ... shopping around getting ... exactly however\nShe will have to call the gas company and request a larger meter for her house and it's free of charge the gas company will come out in upside for meter one size I'm\nProbably the middle sized meter to be able to handle the generator in the other gas equipment in our house so that when they're all running at the same time [noise]\nNothing gets starved of natural gas there's enough supply there for her\nSo terms of the internal piping the plumber would determine yes whether any of that I Need to upgrade and go run a separate line correct so you could ask us company takes care of the meter and the [noise] the plumber would we write and such that took care of that\nYes correct so hopefully I've somewhat to answer your question but um you know if I haven't you can feel free to call me and um again I can be reached at five eight\nFour to eight seven thousand and I do a lot of generate a work all the time and um [noise] um I can go over everything with you\nAnd she did the last question she hears us there was this though she knew to permit so few words for the absolute for the standby but if she were doing a um [noise] the manual I guess you still need a permit to me that the\nThe kind of action the connections yeah as a transfer yeah I Try to permit everything I can um you hand within reason in my home in on you to do it\nRight now no I handled the permitting and and all that so and inspector will have to come out and if it's a standby generator you love to inspectors you'll have the gas inspector come out the gas piping and you'll have the electrical come out to inspect the electrical connections could get\nA good host sounds pretty good size so yeah you think he was just gives him a call if you've got questions and or you can make an appointment ... social situation if you are in a similar situation is Joan I'm\nYeah I'm an editor and like every every house has different John as you know I mean you know the the demand that they want or whatever so\nI think you may Joan happy with your your your answers because she's she's got the\nCourage to call in now and talk to you a lot of great shown welcome to the hearing and outline you live on the radio\nYeah we try and get one [laughter] but um I just wanted to add that I Do have natural gas propane at this time okay I don't know if I could live on a dirt road I kinda doubt there's any gas line here but I'm not sure\nSounds like propane is probably going to be your source of energy than\nYeah yeah yeah I mean I guess I mean ... and and that's fine I mean I've had\nCustomers that that I\nHave propane um that strictly just for the generator hum that usually two tanks well what's the size of the tanks and a hundred ... how do they go by propane\nTanks or the ... the upright ones or sixties hundreds one twenty five yeah I think I've seen\n'em when you know people do standby generator I think it's two hundred gallon tanks I'm side by side to each other but that's something I can help\nUs you know uh we could we could contact the propane company and it just going to be an added expense that's all right um I don't know how they figure them in stone tanks and you might it might be a contract saying or I'm not sure how they charge\nBut yeah um now do you know this this company called general wrapped did they they have to have a propane thought to right\nNow ... is the maker of a generators I'm so they wouldn't they wouldn't get involved with any of the propane set up or anything like that it's the contractor that you pick to install the generator which will help you with that\nI'm okay you know and that's something I can help you with okay so you could you come this far into marrying and yeah I ... actually I\nFelt let me just get this straight you Jim ... Jim\nOkay um okay I Will give you a call then\nOkay yeah right there by not by us Joe [noise]\nI'll tell you do it folks you could even send an email and fall over the phone call\nWhenever checks will be glad to hear your questions in to try to keep you on the straight and narrow if you have questions for us you can reach us a five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five dislike Cheryl has done from a self Yarmuth Cheryl welcome to the handy man hauling\nHi hello\nYou I live here on the radio with us here in the handyman on\nI'm listening to radio I listen to you every single Saturday I think you guys are wonderful never thought I'd have to call your though well thank you but I don't think I've got a question that you got it probably laugh at it that's a stupid one no no no there are no stupid questions okay I've got a farmer in my addict\nOr a those are not friendly to have you\nKnow and uh I Am a very very old and I I'm legally blind and I've been sleeping in the living room because I think spending time in the wall of my bedroom\nAnd very noisy and he is driving me out of my mind I think you've got to give me my first coronary\nOr they're not going to let that happen\nWell anyway I I had I add the working man out here for my and they were very nice and they came back out all the way back out again because I had something in the attic and they didn't catch me for it and they were nice about it and\nThey get they thought it was all but they can't do it because the squirrels allied allied wildlife gray all I can go oh they gave me a telephone number for\nTrue ... percent thing out of Georgia and the guy in darkness that runs it for them here and it came out two days ago\nAnd he said definitely had a squirrel and a ... with the band and I don't know how it showed that and it goes up so high on the side of the out there is nothing for him to stand on to chew it either I just can't understand it but they say at this girl I'm going to have to believe them\nSo that they could they get them out or did they well\nThey had they acted true company whatever it is that they had to set a trap and the trap what's going to kill and I don't get going\nIt and then our customers calling well we want we want to meet their needs will well you know the ... well they're and they're in need and while they're ready to spend some money we need to make it so don't worry because\nIt it even if you have people that called John it's it's it's tough tough getting anything done these days are getting their busy\nI hear ya I hear you I I had to put a call into an engineer the other day because I've got a project that I needed engineers eyes on and as I told my my customers says you know\nI Know what your problem is I'm pretty sure I I you know I've been around long enough but I don't have the credentials as the end of my name's so I think you'll feel better if I actually get an Asian in here to tell you what's going on with your your structure [noise] um\nI don't think you're going to get different answers which would probably feel better [laughter] now and try to get an engineer to to get some time to take is is a jealous\nI have a good friend that's in the irrigation business and you know costs when it's hot out he's crazy and\nHis line I've known him for years his line is the squeaky wheel gets the grief such true and it is so true [noise]\nI Can't tell you how many phone calls I get in people's come out and say\nWell you know when you get a few minutes just call me and you know whenever I'm like no no no no just call me just keep calling me there is a little bit at the bottom and buy all if you don't want 'em at a time and it's true the squeaky wheel gets the grace\nNow you get some bigger coming like my my my Bob fringe company 'cause he's got he's got his wife who runs the office and he's got people uh employee\nAnd companies like Stewart painting or my shoulders got a couple of dedicated salespeople and and a dedicated office staff\nYou can stay on top of that stuff that people like you and I assume that it while I'm In van ... I mean you get home at the end of the day and you get the phone calls in the office paperwork to stay on top of and permits to apply for whatever we're doing is constant ... and er it it's a challenge\nYou know yesterday I had a relatively early day I was home at four o'clock and but I sat in my office until six six thirty making phone calls I'm like I got to address it before the weekend\nExactly why wait until Monday morning because then that shows it's ugly face again let's just take care of it all now and be done with it [laughter]\nOr we enjoy as a handyman ... as we can do the him in and get more calls when we get home [laughter] so let's go to the phones that we were going to wear hand\nThis time so um we're we're reaching over the bridge so to Jay welcome Jay to the handyman hotline\nOr good afternoon how can we have today\nYeah I I just got a quick question I guess it's like finish carpentry work or something I've got doors in my house going to like bedrooms in office space and uh they go through the seasonal shrinking contracting expanding well now they've gotten to a point where they don't even latch it's been so much\nFrank I guess in the ... or I don't know what's what's happening um is there a way I can correct that and get it ... it was well at least latch\nYeah I suspect if you if you step back and take a look at the door that there's probably a gap a at the top of the door but yeah that's a wider you know at the knob side then there's the hinge side\nYeah and if that's the case or the what's happening is the the house of settling of sorts yeah and so now the the uh the latch on the on the handle does not line up with the little striped plate it's on the the gym\nYou know what you basically need to do is a high ball and maybe make a mock with a pencil where the center of that latch wants to go find a whole to sit in and then adjusts just write play in your in your house you're probably going to dress the down [noise] okay and um so\nUh it's uh it it appears that uh it's lined up okay it's just that the dog doesn't reach the strike like the\nThe loud you got that much shrinkage going on yeah it's yeah it's weird sometimes we have to do that with a storm door you know an ad ... and build out the the strike like yeah yeah\nI didn't know if I had a bullet door often with something behind the answers they edit it out a little bit or yeah you're probably going to want to do both ways because if it's ... you can there is no you're getting any privacy even if it's a bathroom or something like that [noise]\nUm yeah so now you want to yeah pay all your hands just a little bit so that that are sitting more in the middle of the opening\nYeah and then you may have to cut out the strike played too so but I like to yeah it grabs\nA unusual that you would have that much of it\nYeah there was just it's gotten worse over the years oh just games like ah initially the strike would it would latch just barely you know during the summer and stuff when things are expanding but in the wintertime it would wouldn't\nLaugh at all so now it's you know what you around so these are real solid wood doors I mean they gotta yeah probably ... or something yeah um but there must be old doors to buddy\nAnd they're not that all the houses only twelve years old\nReally well so is it a pie in like a six pounds ...\nMother we have I think it is yeah yeah so maybe that's just the quality of the good in\nUm yeah because nowadays they're making 'em pine the six panel pine doors to ditch the rails styles the
