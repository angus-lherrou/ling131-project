I was on while while amazed so there is like there is products like you said that the ... thing\nThis is going to work you know there's other things share you know simple green might have worked there sure sure you know whatever other things that are clean and decrease or a spray nine is another really good ones\nBut uh yeah she was happy ... got a fireplace cleaner customers will be happy so [laughter]\nAh yeah here we are very specific of what\nYeah what what do I say my deck with I don't know I have fourteen things which one would you like\nRight exactly and then you've got to the ended drilled down into figuring out or what's the problem with the deck is in just tires it got green mold or is it got this has got anything on\nRunning things we've got to know a a you know I Want to see on my deck what am I feeling with well there's only about two thousand of those item that [laughter]\nBut it's it's a that's the way of the world today yeah yeah it is so but good products so yeah that's that's the ... primaries dozens or product as well and um that product the promotion comes in I think actually sat and send me glass it does come in a flat\nSo they all are very clean up all you know yeah\nYeah but that that closet should got to get a little ventilation into that closet to it sounds\nLike ... you know it's it's interesting because ah actually ... radio listener and he\nHe didn't want to call into the show he was he's he thought he had a leak and he'd have bigger issue going on yeah eating these cuts of holes in the closet you couldn't find it felt kinda foolish calling up and saying you know I've I've got this problem is there's no full of questions I might give you an answer over there\nAnd got an outcome clashed especially when it comes\nTo something like that and your initially you would probably say wow is it a leak yeah I mean\nYeah but it turns out when we put all the pieces together and they'll look at the timeline they had an energy audit done a year or so ago and had them come in in in insulate any they felt that immediate comfort level after the blown insulation and stuff is done\nThen didn't connect the dots and say gee just mold issue happened after they in LA they related fan of the house is just to ... yeah and now now the air's circulating in ... I'm ... and in stale areas like closets and you put them under goods\nWhether goods tend to ... an easy win ... often yeah now now you have a problem and do you think he's got a leak just\nI don't see any border stains I don't know I don't see any way of war Begich just built up moisture from in the air right gets around you and get a a a good advice and they get a a a human stat the out so that you can measure get three of them reach level your house and it just monitor what's going on and\nYou know pay attention to how you use exhaust fans are for bathrooms taking a shower and you're cooking you know do you have any roots as it re circulate the air on his that exhausted yeah turn the fan on when you're boiling Boston right you know stuff\nAnd usually the humidifier analysis gotta gotta use the on it and if you've got to order house\nNot but I mean you know it up in the summertime when it's humid like that a simple window air conditioner can help too oh sure they're like so it was more than I I mean\nLike my house has no circulation I'm a little up on a hill and the way my house is set up never do I get a cross breeze where my temperature is what the temperature is outside yeah you know so if it's fifty I'm fifty now and there is no and then but when it gets hot and\nSun beats on at the boiling really cooks but if I don't take that money if it's humid I don't take that moisture out in my house it's unlivable yeah and you know a couple of simple window air conditioner in my home makes like the world the difference and it does take the humidity out to people don't ... they think it's just cooling it's not just cooling it's also\nTake no damage on Asia yes you have to have the duck was their condition you're going to do that though yeah yeah I got this year that yeah that does your world on believable Battlemind daddy lying I mean I I really want to do that I mean\n'cause the vast majority of the time this this summer we would have the air conditioning on the unit upstairs in the bedroom on and take care of upstairs and downstairs we would just have it on\nThe humidity gauge we wouldn't even have it on cool or the air conditioning mode and it dropped to ... be ... it made it so\nMore comfortable that it felt like it was noticeably colder and there was just pulling out the moisture in the air it's still\nYou know you look at the temperature on the thermostat in the wall and not really moving all that might have doesn't feel that way but it just feels so much better yeah and I and that's that's all we went through pretty much the the two real July and August we had a couple a couple of six\nWeeks or so yeah a lot in the bank about how that five six weeks how humid and all that much and yet I was like you said all that Bush is trapped in there it has nowhere near where I go it's just Yeah Yup yup yup yeah self melt but that will help the problem yeah but it's not it's not like\nWhere to find space and how to condense things and tweak things but hey I Need to expand it to make it look like it's more he knows I'm In that too yeah so ah I said okay I Need for feed here and you know the three feet here I Need to find something here\nAnd he goes [noise] are you telling me need like twelve feet in the store right now [laughter] but you know what though he literally in about an hour walking around talking about things\nCreate like just twisting the block certain way of doing this or why he found it no no you know so uh which is good he's you know very helpful very very helpful because where it's a little wiener with employees at this time of year kids back to college and\nYou know and right yeah exactly and that's it and I ... and it's hard to find people that worked including your help it you can head on back to school yeah yeah and every week is a little different because a commitment to the high school kids can come in for the one college students that I have right now and um so yeah it's a\nIt's a it's a little harder right now I Know in that part of it but you know we're pretty experienced staff right now so that's you\nKnow is it a busy time of year because it's the fall and at ... starting to okay they took the summer off of maybe doing things around ...\nListen with all the humidity late in the summer and then all of a sudden the sad part the hard part was September of ... yeah and that's you know we and our country I normally the painters have\nReally taken a hit for that yeah you know and I'm the humidity is really humidity is just like rain yeah that'd be really want to think about it you wake up in the morning and you walk outside and you feel like you're wet guess what your houses ... you\nKnow you get a white trim boards down shakes and clap board a second that moisture and you're like no one I don't think anyone painted a deck for like August first to like September fifteenth I don't think I saw any debt products no\nBecause he says it was just too humid too humid so I'm a you know with the out like right now like today is like the perfect day yeah to be outside your window sill shorter obviously because you got to be stopped paying attention to temperatures that night ... in the morning get you you can have the do you know on on a\nOn your would and whether it's decades are citing or trend boards or whatever yeah you just walk across the front lawn and your feet of snow you get outside your cars what you are you already much know that you need to wait a couple of hours to start applying paint\nPainting and moisture do not work together at all zero no but um but I you know I mean I I Would say August says okay September was flat but this I see that this phone's gonna be really you know you can tell\nSo that so what you're saying is there's a niche opportunity fall\nOn the whole thing in the snow and the painting world to have a product that can handle humidity and wet surfaces to be applied\nThere are some for ducking yeah that you can apply even if it's damp yeah\nBut I Know you know they have stuff for different temperatures now ... right so which they I mean they've thirty five degree I'm Robin ... yeah Denmark doesn't day kind of stayed out of that um the I think that a smart idea yeah but um\nYou know because the problem is maybe you could apply it but then at night if it's twenty seven\nAnd by the way if you end up having a little moisture behind their I mean I I've had guys come in at our experience and painted a whole house when you know woke up the next day went to the house and it's all in cheats in their backyard really dislike 'cause it was a little damp came right out attempt came down\nIt hadn't adhered yet like literally like sheets yeah\nCame right on happen yeah so but ah but at\nThis is a great time to work outside as you guys probably loved working outside at this time oh yeah yeah yeah cool at school and has been you know you feel like you got it yeah but your energy levels higher ... and ... that's what that's why it may be higher in the end it's longer\nYou know because you feel like you can go a little longer yeah sure you know and I'll be out wearing out wearing out yeah yeah I also get energy to go in the sun's going down yeah I don't want to go when I worked in the trades ... it was like\nLike the hot days were were you know they knew it like you would just be drenched cell drenched in being going three miles an hour yeah and and just and then I also does when he worked outside in the winter and I always felt like you were able to get through but when you're a ... got home you're more tired because you have\nYour ... your body work so hard to stay at that\nBus you walk in you hit that heat is should I ... I mean the greatest sleeping pill after being outside of ... who Ninety night every\nBut I just I I mean obviously like to buy a couple of gallons of paint today and the next two days like this is a good weekend to be out there doing stuff yes and I just got to be careful in the morning and make sure there's no do besides that you should be in great shape this weekend [noise]\nAnd you know so but but you know every year every month or so different you can't like predict you can't like looked like last year and say okay right you know you know this is what what Labor Day weekend this year and last year almost identical ...\nNo I like to I guess by Google whether I bet to the weather was very troubling identical yeah who is very similar to this but like this weekend like I looked at\nLast like last year and I'm Down you know ... it must not have been a good weekend last year run out so you just don't know people come to close up their host houses at this time to ... so you see is a little bit of that are anti freeze for the\nWater offshore to get out and as the weekend to oh we're in snow stakes must be starting to sell those because I Swear when we were driving home last night and we saw houses a along sick say with snow stakes ... three already up so we're\nIn we're thinking we're talking and saying you know the kind of like a you know hey look at us we're gone already you know yeah I don't Brazil sports in the house because yeah you put in the snow stakes now here it is an October six and\n... you know maybe hire somebody to come in like November beginning of December and put 'em in like when everybody else would be putting but I have\nHeard though there's been some production out there that we are supposed to see snow in October of this year I've heard that like a multitude of times already I'm not sure who's saying that\nBut it'll it gives them a job that information and I hope so this is this supposed to be some snow out in the Midwest\nGoing on right now right now I don't think about that so it's we don't want to rock and roll I mean ... summer I Do have ice melt on the way do you do or do you have any job a little old you are at all for an hour in little lax slash craziest one\nMaybe like a half a storm yeah we have a little bit left in the store not much and um I have a good friend of mine who does a like a bunch of like um [noise]\nLike hotels and stuff like that you already made as if somebody offered him maintenance helps them with like design and buying stuff in carpeting and flooring so he helps them out a little bit with ice melt so\nWe uh I called them from my trade show in Las Vegas it's a hundred and twenty five I Know it's like a hundred and twenty I gone sweating all over myself I'm like ah what do you like to share a ... a a truckload of ice melt with\nAny luck [laughter] and\nYou know I'm like I'm melting underneath all got out of uh the desert and he goes yeah I'll do that\nSo [laughter] I'm hoping they all

desert sun of Las Vegas yeah ordering an outer ring up ice melt it's ridiculous are you talking about how much\nBleach you went through in the last four months yeah how much ... do you go through any ... depends it really depends\nOn like we all have talked about a zillion times all that bad winter a few years ago and uh if I had five hundred thousand pounds I Would have sold every pound but yeah you could never ... whatever I bought that came into the store and went out to store just as fast and I think\nI I we went over two hundred thousand pounds ice melt that year and I was nine and a half

[laughter]\nI'll guarantee one thing they'll be specials on snow shovels her\nBasement that's the place and you can't really you can't put too much to know just a little little bit so I walked in the

in a in a very short time it'll it'll\nGo and are you wasting your money by by\nRight amount of money into ... or so in the last ten years have you had it serviced at all you have it set up now so I'm Wondering if um I mean ... water is over the damn now but if if it were service every year every other year if it would have prevented whatever the situation was that ... yeah really fair I\nThink I I I checked with people that oh no it's natural gas\nYou know it's not like\n... you don't have to have in Queens every year\nOil generally do have to do them every year but not least maybe every other year or two okay look for different things and yeah yeah I mean as as I say it's a cleaner much cleaner burning fuel but still it's a fuel and there's right residuals yeah I mean\nYou gotta make sure things that were you out and it's it could be a situation where the sense that wasn't serviced\nThe entire ten years that you make this one repair and then going forward made it and you maintain you do the duty inspections and and the cleaning ... every year every year you could maybe get did not necessarily\nBecause this is the tip of the iceberg you make this repair now whether things are going to be going in short order ... but um\nI Will say that our uh our heating and air conditioning and ventilation expert Bob ... who deals with hot air furnaces and the installation and and the

M. direct metal tank\nYep very familiar with that comes in oil and latex actually\nYeah right and I and I use the oil one day recommended go with the oil they made me a perfect call ... excellent the reason I was paying because it was on call and can't get on the no more like this kind of on the F different shades of on but the minute I Need it they had to match up beautiful I did it when I got it I\nPut it on what great then after dry I looked at what the heck\nEvery single possible brush mark you can pick up on you and I use I use a good brush I I Know and like I don't know how to pay and I I paint all time yeah never had this problem\nA call dog them they didn't know what it was never heard of that ... his wife is because the rest of the way in prime at night that shouldn't my daughter\nI called Benjamin Moore and I talked to a couple of tax over there and the guy on the same thing he says I don't understand why did that he says I'm always attempt to pay the bus sixty five well that's your problem like they asked me is my problem right there goes\nYour says this shouldn't you shouldn't use that paying less it's less than Seventy five a novice in Seventy five degrees I said wait a minute on your can it says sixty five to I don't know what it was eighty I haven't got a handle on any\nAnyhow I or Saturday I did it again I let you know what I did upstairs in my living room actually mhm where it was ... about Seventy degrees\nSixty eight right same same thing happen every boarding brush mock ... I never see it like this I I Try to do to brush up one got another one uh I mean I started junk Russia's you\nKnow have you with Russia's ah you know pretty brushes I took a brush right okay\nThat way I Know I mean now I mean as long as it's an oil brushed but the bald headed I listen to the the paints today even that um the T. M. they're used they're they're pretty good about like self leveling themselves\nMore homey says yeah and I was ... says well what do you do find out I says how do you make your leveling level and why any level and\nI Know that I mean I Am not had that experience with that product I saw actually a step of substantial Marta a mound of that product in oil and latex um you know it's interesting like the what the what you are working on on your ... your pores hot water or for Assad error\nHot water right I mean all I I repainted every one of mine in my house and know what I use I use my whatever I was using for trend paint in that room I put on that\nOn them I mean yeah you know clean them and paint them and I'm On the unit nah no\nNo oh no sorry no none of that I'm In one room I have the old I'm actually is an old in Provo item high gloss\nAnd um which is actually a metal pay for indoor and outdoor but it's also for wood and then in my ... my other living room which I just there about three years ago I use the sun or a product which is a latex products\nLike I said clean paint over they look beautiful she got to remember something like the heat does not affect the paint on that stuff because it's code the code like a baby can go up and touched that and not getting burned so\n... any paint can be used so I ... I I I Wish I had a real answer for you in reference to the um to why you had brushed marks but there were there any brush marks at all and the rest Olien primer when you finish did you notice all the money so\nThey came up excellent I say and and the only state where the story because I'm the rush stole him they couldn't ah they don't mix the college for a ...\nType thing yeah and I'm going to get a ... in the last six months or I have had not one but two maybe three different contractors by that direct a metal oil\nAnd use it interior on wood trend because the customers mandated a semi gloss oil and there is not a lot of it out there and I'm Talking about and like I'm Talking about twenty thirty gallons a guy in like a five to ten million dollar house\nWow so they have metal there and what are you allowed because it is that you believe it or not even though it's a D. T. M. you can still use it on wood and bomb and so so I it by like so I I Know those guys are doing in these big houses and like multi million dollar houses in because that that's what like all the\nThe the powers that be forced them want to do they want it and they don't realize yeah not a lot of oil paint so listen I I mean some of them have been done for a couple of years with zero issue I'm the only thing I Wonder like you if you even though you had a I think it could have been a humidity slash\nBooster slashed temp issue in the basement ... yeah yeah and I know that I've had people that have painted outdoor stuff in basements\nAnd the product never dried no really tells you want to know why that stuff is made to dry outside as weird as ... sounds and it it\nDoesn't mean it happens every time but not of hadn't happened in certain instances mhm so you either that the other the only other odd thing that you can do and it's and it's not that easy but you can if you have the cans of paint believe it or not\nEvery can of paper bend Moore has a batch code on it and the ... can be sent to bend more and find out those every issue with that batch that particular ... which\nIs ... because they're five hundred gallon batches so it doesn't doesn't happen yeah I've had a couple of bad I had a batch of something bad before but I asked that is either you could look into as well\nAsked that ah the hardware store I got it from I said yeah the it's old paint cause like saint Pete Tim how often I think people use it that much ... maybe ... on time it's old and um I I talked to a good one bedroom one night I I think they asked me a code number and he says nice it that wasn't affected our cause it to do that\nYeah it just ... like you said you know a loved one\nWhile the oil paints last a long time to mount a few store that oil paint properly dry cool area you could have happened in ten years and use that paint\nIs you can't see at once I'm Out there on the market is down to four you know you wouldn't know what was the if you walked in my home but I was when I picked up\nA piece of looked at it and the like you don't make the light shines so you can look at that's what I Want I yeah I can see and I stopped plush kind never had a problem with Benjamin Moore I I Love that pain but I just thought you might have an idea but yeah it was the U.S and\nIt looked like the the like I said I if I got guys that are using that product actually I sold about twelve gallons of the loss in oil this week\nTo a guy that's using it inside on trend so I mean I I over the last year I've done a substantial amount of that product ... let me tell you something if they were brush box I wouldn't know about it yeah your body as fast as I Know I Know where they're putting a stop so absolutely I\nListen to dry up the air is to dry like in the winter it's usually dry in my home it's real dry could make it all level like you know what I mean all the ...\nWe if I could I Would but it just doesn't work that way we ... we yeah we talk about our twenty thousand a thousand products you know we tried to bring in the ones that we feel that we can do the best with ... we get a lot of cars and stuff we will add we will change\nYeah there's you know we can't be everything to everybody unfortunately you know it's hard at it is hard and that's any small business you know I mean you go to your favorite restaurant\nYou know there are ... and not selling lobster you know I mean if there is yeah who plays than not selling that like steak ... primarily get that's how it works so you've got a you know you gotta know what you're going to sell and listen to paint world is driving our business it's that simple bend more dense driving\nAnd uh that side of the store has been spectacular for the last eight nine years so you know you have to pay attention to that now\nBut I ... and speaking of products say we haven't talked about yet but\nOne of the one of the things we talk about with the Sheldon stewardess Stewart painting I mean\nIt it's almost to the point where it could be you know a a drinking game whatever you say bleaching Joe ... you know oh yeah one of those things we say it over and over ... because it's such a great a great product and it's not the only thing and there's there's none of us on the other ways to do in ... he was saying\nBut each one ... have this new product out which is it attaches to your host so\nBecause we always talk about getting a tax prayer and you read the the back of a Joe ... down yeah you know three quarters of a cup of Joe ... two and a half cups of bleach to mix two gallons of the mixture with water the job matching the\nBleach compost great if you're running a hundred gallon tank out in the back of a truck and cleaning the house yeah dump a gallon of this three gallons of that the rest water now in Iraq and Iran and yeah yeah but like for the the basic ... homeowner\nOr someone who just needs to get a twenty foot section offense cleaning or one side of the house that doesn't look right\nThey do they give you come in my stories literally attach it to your host to the host shown you read the directions and then five minutes later you're often right by the way it's a quick process it's not yeah it's not like we're talking about ours here like you can do a side of a house in thirty minutes or owning your deck in an hour\nYeah or unless I mean I I did a couple of friends that I I went in there I was I was looking in I think it was just getting\nJust a fresh bottle ... to go with a bottle of bleach I had because I had my two gallon or three gallon\nTanks prayer gonna fill up and go to go out and I walk in there and I see this hose attachment whoa yeah waited to kind of make my life a little easier with this project and it is and sure enough he goes on\nAnd then you switch to rinse and you're in and said all off\nThe ... the the cool part about ... is the companies actually owned by ... today which actually guess right on St Joe Macs are selling homes both of them they own both of ... it was actually originate originally in Massachusetts based company\nThat's why I bought it yeah because at a local salesman who lived on the line a little bit good guy I met a trade show my famous trade show twice a year ago you know he showed up at my store one day and you guess what I bought the product because it was but it was made locally you leave it or not that's the only reason I started with that yeah\nAnd I ... and actually I like the concept of it but when they converted their product to the hose and ...\nItem so they haven't for a deck and they have one for a house yeah and obviously they want the deck is much higher concentrated because of how it only ... like eight hundred square feet for a little bottle dollhouse ones like bought thousand or so just for fun of it I bought twenty five each they sold it literally and pears in about two weeks yeah gone yeah\nSo we probably sell a couple of hundred bottles of each one of them now Larry has tried it and what they did is when they modify to put in the bottle they added gel bleach\nA little bit of job bleach and what it does is that when the liquid goes let's say you're doing it for a six foot high fencing decided at the top and you work your way down\nWhen you initially hit the top of the gel be sure that the water would go down like in things dreams like little\n... liquid which if it if it had regular bleaching would\nJust clean those line it wouldn't be even the gel bleach drags the whole thing down yeah though it comes down and much more even basis so it allows it to claim or even like the cool part is is like I I used it on my house I just wanted I yelled for the\nSix bucks for ten bucks or whatever it is I tried one home and just a tremendous luck and like it's All right about three days later I'm like whoa [laughter] it takes time for it to\nYou know kind of to get to work right ... and actually I had a lady in this or this week trying to take care of some ... issues on her room and\nShe she got I said listen you know it's going to take some time for it to go away oh yeah well what do you mean\n... but it's still did lose a business is\nA line that I tell everyone it took months and months and years for it to grow it's going to take a long time for it they go like yes cheap addict\n[laughter] it's not an instantaneous Idaho and especially that actually growing into your shame oh exactly and that's why you don't agitated with a broom fight to get the stuff off the ... break apart and in in in you know blow away flood\nThat made that made literally washing offensive side of your house or yeah jak relatively easy listening obviously if you have a a big house that it needs to be completely done you know if you want there are there are obviously great services are people out there that wash houses and really do a great job in their professional\nAnd you know it's it's a different animal rights but if you're looking for a living animal yeah like house cleaning it or debt cleaner and it's really good gets a good product\nBy but wait seven seven five nine nine eight five to go to Andy in east him any walk to the end of an outline how are ya\nI'm good thanks for taking my call I appreciate your recording for\nWell I had a question regarding refinishing a countertop um we're redoing a kitchen and the countertops are made out of what actually play ... that have been a\nCoated with what I think it's all your thing um they haven't been touched in about Thirty years\nUm we don't want to want to rip him out\nIn a situation where we really can't is a horrible Toxie product um or looking for some sort of advice and guidance on what we can do their refinish those um so that it's still fairly food safe but not got a lot going to absorb water\nSo they are those are they um it's boards that are put together so you have do you have little ... seems or or joins\nNo no Steve\nI'm their worldwide plank I'm actually just one giant piece of wood\nBut oh yeah that their life that's why we don't want to do anything to take 'em out or or destroy him yeah or or looking at it we're looking to suppress them up a little bit\nUm I'd like to see them before I may comment [laughter] I'd be listened and I'm going to tell you why\nI'm a I'm a huge like keeping stuff natural kind of guy when it comes to what you're describing to me if you're describing it correctly I watch I watch American Pickers every night that it's on or something like a piece of ... but they literally pay hundreds of dollars for something that I think is worth nothing\nLike that so I Am not a big year thing than on that kind of situation no because OK well because\nYou're 'cause like doing it yourself I think over time it's just gonna get caught up and kind of\nLike anything you're going to put on there yeah it's got to be food safe to be clear and you want to really clear\nI mean it's going to get it going to get hacked up just wear and tear wearing yeah you obviously you use a cutting board to make your cuts in the right to say you're still going to get scrapes and scratches and and things just being on there just living\nThe ... I mean I ... if you want to leave it cleared the only real thing is a year or the same product a virus thinking\nOr something like Helms then that sort of marine product is that's the right\nAround I think I don't want to use anything that would go outdoors though because there's anti micro wheels and not to keep that suffer mill doing OK okay anything outdoors is a different issue I I\nBelieve you could even do a year thing only a water base waterborne yeah it will yellow or goes on thin or um got its marshals you more ... than the foil base\nThat and I I ... I Am I'm going to tell you about to products that I have in my store in waterborne um this company called old masters\nOkay super good company in the staying in Europe thing we're all day they recreated their water based Europe against a couple of years ago and they call a master armor and they actually have what they call apart before it's a hardening product\nReally yes so you can take a take a quarter of it and say whatever it is two ounces and\nAnd it's like it becomes a boxy okay you start using you have a and actually the first time you use it there is no pot life after a certain amount of time it ... back to the water Europe thing again does that end time you add that part B you have a pot life\nOK Okay Number so that's a pretty cool product then we'll wind it's cured it's super super super hard\nLike the other thing that I actually just bought I literally just brought it to my store Barrett saying as another company out there they're owned by Ron stole him they just came out with a um a year or thing that has actually up in what they call a three act product recall you put down as equal the three\nWow okay okay comes in oil and in latex I actually I just received them in my ... this week they're not even on a shelf yet that's another episode do research on those two items the war on one I don't think is right for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "06"}
