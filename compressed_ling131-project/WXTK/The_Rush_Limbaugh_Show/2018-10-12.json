P. Morgan we had a whole has to banks that came out uh with earnings this morning J. P. Morgan being one of them open in positive territory roll over a little bit here right now I'm curious what your thoughts are on them and general before we get specifically to earnings\nYeah I mean I think the numbers were a pretty solid or you know but they've had a history of beating\nA earnings usually by pretty wide amount so I think maybe a you know this was kind of expected and you're just getting a bit of a pullback or you know because they didn't beat by maybe a larger amount I mean when you look at me a Wells Fargo which is actually still off\nOn their earnings which aren't nearly as impressive I I think it was just a bar with someone spoke\nWith a lot of banks the conventional wisdom is when interest rates are moving up\nBanks are typically going to do well in this case J. P. Morgan open the year hundred and Seventy dollars a share right now a hundred and seven dollars a share even though the ten year treasury has gone from two for up to almost three two I'm curious your thoughts as to why we haven't seen much movement in this chair stock price as well as other banks is well\nNo it's a great question I mean I think that there might be some concerns about the negative effects\nOf rising rates obviously a you know it does make a loans are more profitable a increases margins but you do also have the demand side of the equation they now have a mortgage rate third year fix that you know averaging around five percent or so\nThat might make it more difficult for people to get financing could see a a further slow down there in the housing market we've already had a\nCouple of the locations where prices are starting to ah to slow or you know the the rate of the increase is blowing in some cases where prices are even going down I think you know that could be a potential problem for any bank with a mortgage business large their\nPull the last five years we've seen a rise in a large number of fit in tech companies coming in and trying to under cut the pricing structure of the legacy companies like J.

P. Morgan is there any company that potentially looks like an acquisition candidate for them either smaller regional banks or any kind of tech company to maybe get into that space it a little bit more heavily\nPossibly on the tax code I wouldn't rule out a deal there\nI'd be very surprised if shaping Morgan where to try and increase the\nBacking footprint with a regional thing yeah we have an ad on me [laughter] we haven't had a lot of banking ill lately a and I don't think that uh you know many of the big banks are looking to expand their deposit based that dramatically especially when you've got it back like than they are already so large that\nUh you know I think that you start running into cap when it and then it starts with the Federal Reserve they were doing a significant feel\nGood Paul we got to let you go but thanks for the time and will catch up with the next week they do polling Monica from CNN Business talking about G.

it's classic if you sign on to agreeing on the whole premise of climate change your dream do a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you read and start criticizing everybody

[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nBy the way it folks I I've got two more stories that focus on the insanity of the left I mean and I'm not using the term loosely here's another one Susan Glasser staff writer at the New Yorker she writes a weekly column on life in Trump's\nWashington she writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's why what life in Washington has become because the Trump once a week [noise] [noise]\nThis piece the headline I listen to all six Trump rallies in October and you should to some had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\n\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in didn't watched six Trump rallies\nAnd she is up set\nThat they're only on CSPAN she's mad that Fox is stop covering them that CNN is stopped covering them that pie MSNBC uh stopped covering them because she thinks\nThey are damaging to Trump She thinks if the people of this country's solve these rallies that it would be the end of Trump\nShe points out how Trump lies all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time she totally\nMiss understands the purpose of the rally she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection or the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this she does not know how to listen to the Trump She does not know how to uh emphasize with Trump rally at ten days she has no ability\nTo relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is\nAppalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time\nHe ... he mocks people he makes fun of people he's mean meanwhile\nPeople at these rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to a Trump rally and this woman is studying she's watching six of them so far this month\nAnd totally does not get it she is missing the purpose of the rallies\nShe does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump net gates and goes over the drive by me something Reagan also master\n\nMasterful they are formulaic even though everybody thinks they're improv and off script they are formulaic there are segments\nIn every Trump rally and he follows them to achieve what\nHe says differs in some cases but the point is here's a drive by media specialist ... and totally doesn't get it it's the exact opposite if these rallies were televised nationally as they used to be\nThere wouldn't be any talk of a blue wave anywhere except New York and\nCalifornia Rush Limbaugh member could use the bombing I be worse\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends at Mahendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military salute give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicle that's right a brand new read my hindrance retriever one thousand gas model\nWith it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw it because it wasn't true and it's\nIt's fairly common that these people on the left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's the Democrats blue wave is drying up\nOh that's how it would be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth teen mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely throw Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate they suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nOr the ... in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seats if they have they held by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state to show her and this is all happening and ... the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls which say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the want the murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interest in in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi of hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and\nSixty different articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and violence in the movie\nAnd it's to pick them in in ...\nFor ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate\nIt's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well\nDone for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not

even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your a moving target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nParentheses to murder the journalist\nBy

which is a crock he did his monitoring after abortion it'd become legal\nBut they're trying to say everybody you know you better you better not get what you wish for here because if you ever if you

feet which would be underwater and I just got to think well you know he's not good at predicting the future maybe you can explain that\nOr someone please explain how about twenty thousand\nA year in a way that you know this is really a great point and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and because it you're right on the money out Gore had said\nJust in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan he has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels will be underwater and he did say\nAbout Miami\nThat it was only a few short years at Miami certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground on one of the biggest malls in the country do you have to ask yourself\nWho in their right mind would go out and get the financing and make all\nOf the decisions and hire all the architect everything else has to be done to build a gigantic mall only to realize it's going to be submerged underwater\nIn a few years who would do this\nWhat kind of responsible planning commission would permitted what kind of developer would waste
