I've got three Thirteen\nActually on a voice vote since two thousand eleven yeah we're going back pre euro debt crisis\nAny a is that a concern I mean ... ... mortgage rates going to go up\nYeah Tucker's mortgage rate is going to go up a ... I got an adjustable rate mortgage so mine's going to go up to [noise]\nYou know what's interesting is even with the ten year moving into a higher yields recently to last week we had actually seen the dollar weakening the last week we finals you know moving back toward strength now or if the dollar does continue to strengthen it does raise some question marks I think you know heading into next year\nUm but it's you know we're pretty much the same level that we were at for the last four or five months right now but if we see you know five or six percent strength above this then I started to get a little concerned kind of strange to see the\nDollar strengthening in oil go up isn't it I mean you gotta will now over Seventy five bucks a barrel everybody says oh don't worry about uh don't worry about it I I I have to find something to worry about that give you plenty no [noise] no they just put it out there you know you had to oil trading Seventy five bucks\nA nobody's turn the heat on yet yeah when I asked her oh oh I have a story for you so [laughter]\nThe other day my or my mother in law uh she uh decided to put the heat on camera\nAnd watch it at feather fiber why I was like oh I don't know it was like fifty degrees outside of a bundle up let's go or else I Know I was just like surprise in September as aggressive huh oh\nI was just went under I'm shaking just thinking of the money that I Would spend if I did I Try to wait till November but\nIt's really hard actually I tried to go to January I mean I think you wait until Thanksgiving and get away with that what\nWhat I used to do and I still lived in a not if you're married and you want to stay married Tucker who would I used to when I Lived in a city in an apartment buildings I Would pretty much moved off of people so I wouldn't be in the middle for ... everyone else and you know pretty much provide your heating\nFor you that is a nice thing about being on the third fourth floor is do you know the heat from yellow\nYou don't do it anymore you know now that I have an actual house it doesn't work that's got to be telling you I I Love to find a way to siphon heat from my neighbor if I could but I I just don't know how to do with what\nUh what do higher wages mean if you're running a dominoes franchise you're running McDonald's franchise I'm just thinking I McDonalds you know minimum wage there's what nine ten bucks an hour and you're a line cook there you're a\nCashier there are you thinking to yourself why do I have to say at McDonalds just go over to Amazon Amazon Amazon is higher even Fifteen bucks an hour you have a pulse you can get a job at Amazon\nYeah and and that a lot of restaurants a waiver expenses typically make up\nYou know between twenty five and thirty percent of the restaurant it's bigger than the rent it is and so if you see wages and again let's look at a company like McDonald's let's see a lot of McDonalds jobs being posted for twelve Thirteen an hour ... did you say okay if they need to get up to Fifteen right that means the twenty five to thirty percent bump in wages that you're sitting there\nAnd what that means is all of a sudden that twenty five to thirty percent of sales that that labor expense used to be\nIs now thirty to thirty five percent right\nSo you got to raise the question is do they raise prices by a corresponding you know five or ten percent to match that and and if they do raise those prices do they still keep people coming in if the value isn't quite what it used to\nBe so what do you think do you think you start to see some of these lower end franchises go out of business like if you're running a dominoes do you just say how the heck with it or ... are thinking about a subway cars subways labor intensive you walk into one of the stores even a small store I have three or four workers\nThere yeah it's I I don't know if you see like the the big names you're you're getting your domino's of the world you're McDonalds as the world they're not going to go out of business because I think they have pricing power ... the ones that are a little bit more questionable that maybe don't necessarily\nDeliver the same kind of value imagine ... ... what was going to have no problem refund customers at McDonalds\nYeah but labor intensive again did they have to figure out how to do that robotically right they use that say robo burrito robo burrito I didn't watch that know how many people there wouldn't be fascinating when you when you go to a ... way though ... about how many different people you're working three ...\nThree you've got the person put it actually for in some cases you've got the person who first put the tortilla down then you've got the person who in the meat and the other stuff then you usually have a glock and special person then you've got the cash register for him\nI mean it's I mean it'll be curious to see I think what you're going the end result will be most of these will stay in business prices will go up\nBut the workers if you go from ten bucks an hour to Fifteen dollars an hour that's fifty percent wage increase dirty bomb and then you're going from twenty grand a year to thirty but they spend here's the difference yeah that\nThat guy that makes goes who their wage goes from ten to Fifteen they spend every nickel of that five dollars more per hour that they're making\nIt will be good for the economy in the long run the other thing that ... on the short term ... the other thing that does is keep a lot of those workers that are at or near minimum wage are collecting an awful lot of benefits whether it's a food stamps were right housing assistance so by getting higher wages it reduces demands on those programs and actually cleans up things from a bunch of perspective\nGreat to see happening very great to see happening\nMarkets in record territory I mean in the market is just ripping the Dow is up one hundred and forty one points at twenty six thousand

with the testimony of one Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nIf there ever needed if if it's ever needed doing supposed is well I think people are going to try to get through this without exposing forward for what she is\n\nYeah yeah yeah I'm going to talk about what Trump to other Trump did not mocked her last night he made fun of her claims he did not imitate the way she speaks\nBut but look I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that but you got to look at it as a Trump is simply providing cover Trump is giving them ... to go ahead and vote the way he did Trump said what needs to be said but these guys aren't going to say it\nHer timeline alone has shifted\nWhen do you think this incident when Kevin all the alleged incident happened because she is described it as early eighty to mitigate any to sometime in eighty three hurt timeline is change based on who she's been talking to\nAnd that has been documented the fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs and not helping people pass them\nThere is a signatory to one of the support letters written for her Monica McLean retired F. B.\nI. special agent her best friend for life\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement to ABC I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have time I've I've just got enough data on this right before the program began I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought it was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she can be destroyed a credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this or through this with out any any\nChallenging them Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art that not many gotten it out of there that time we'll see\nAre especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWhile a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman\nOn mercilessly [noise] so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here from any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... anybody personal server ... about half an hour that's that's how I found an hour and ... even ...\nI talk about an attack Barnes okay I'm In my hand I found I found ... pound bomb\nOr a car I guess maybe even now I'm back\nOn a [noise] yes that's correct ... role by down without a ... [noise]\nYou can read like how many [noise] [noise] I plan running down about ... about their prices by ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence that\nFits vulnerability ... is its fragility almost in a way or maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared\nAnd that is exactly the a\nPersonality that I think she wanted the FX and she succeeded\nWith it and it's because of that but I think I don't no matter what his learned about her and how much she has lived if you will\nA which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had no one else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there I've been noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel literal asked her about subject a and her answer it and read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in\nThat\nShe knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph you imagine why she asking\nThis\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about chemical why aren't you asking her details chicken farm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\n\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best friend in the FBI who read resigned retired in two thousand sixteen\nA wonder how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean oh you know what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as this letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she ... about six hundred bucks on\nA\nFord was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never Rachel metro have you ever get\nAlthough Ninety five sports seeing the Bruins open the regular season tonight in Washington Here that W box TK face off at seven thirty the Yankees host Oakland in the AOL wild card game the winner takes on the red Sox and the a LDS\nChecking the NBC ten Boston early warning a weather forecast there will be intermittent some the rest of the afternoon temperatures old in the sixties partly cloudy tonight lows in the middle fifties limited son mild on Thursday with highs around Seventy\nI'm George ... news radio Ninety five W ...\nHistory this week an Eighteen sixty three expressing gratitude for a pivotal union armies victory Gettysburg President Abraham Lincoln announces that the nation will sell\nThis audio is for your review and now for broadcast Internet posting or distribution others it's a ... copy of the air quality original on his property by our media Washington\nRate and official Thanksgiving holiday of every twenty six Eighteen sixty three speech declared that the fourth Tuesday of every November thereafter would be considered an official US holiday of Thanksgiving\nThis week in Nineteen fifty seven the Soviet Union inauguration the space age with its launch of ... button they cut the world's first artificial satellite the spacecraft\nWas named Sputnik after the Russian word for satellite\nThe U.S government military and scientific community was caught off guard by the Soviet in technological achievements and they're United effort to catch up with the Soviets heralded the beginning of the space race\nThis week in Nineteen sixty five ...\nArrives at Kennedy international airport in New York City the first visit\nBahrain pope to the United states during his tax one day American visit limited entirely to New York city pope Paul visited St Patrick's cathedral met with President Lyndon Johnson at the Waldorf Astoria hotel addressed the general assembly of the United nations attended a public math a Yankee Stadium and then flew back to Rome from Kennedy Airport\nAnd this week in two thousand three actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is elected governor of California despite his inexperience wars and egg or came out on top and the lemon we campaign to replace Gray Davis earlier had become the first United States governor to be recalled by the people since Nineteen Twenty one towards the nigger was one of a hundred and thirty five\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nShe uses for terrifying attractions one location designed get candidates\nOn the ballot which included career politicians other actors and one adult film star\nThat's your look back at this week in history you have something to say completely discuss things he said here and what's going on and off limits or social system news radio Ninety five\nWICK\nTraffic is moving well for us really no major problems are minor problems right now I think they're looking at a route twenty eight to getting through Hyannis things also moving well and what thirty four approaching ...\nSouth Pacific good shape as well as the board ... more ... the average Joe\nForeign oil\nOf building that dream for me the morning from seven to ten ... news radio Ninety five WICK\nRemembering the golden age of radio when radio was Sunday night starting at Penn or news radio Ninety five [noise] WWE watch T.

I\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable or you don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it\nTo everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nStart ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine baldy board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find her compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so critical she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amounts\nAll Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart specially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip them for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump\nGuess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to\nTake a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on\nTrump's tax returns Russia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to they're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\n[noise] a bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi answered don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what you got to do when you got about ... what you want to come up with you but you're not going to you're going to come up by women like New Hampshire gray the ... not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right and they're trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters are flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nWhat we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kavanaugh where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy\nWait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that\nProtester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester the protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\nCassidy you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no not but then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this very\nYoung wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have much to us to say at rush probably ... be met work\nI'm ...

Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they\nPlayed ride along and without ahead Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant by the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was um all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said\nShe doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all

general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case doctor both before and your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable but he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\n\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if\nThey trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans habits Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you what helped me irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you\nHow the lying Leigh insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\n\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked\nMostly for Trump didn't he just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to work all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me to\nWill\nRush or a million women or nor do there should we do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes has it been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even

hair done but I vomit\nMorning he brings wedding go go go available everywhere this record\n[noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books to your ear is the is the James with them to the gym and guarantee quotes from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIt's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something to be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power\nStructure that the founding is responsible and so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nI take it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement\nThat has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls\nThe Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it\nDoesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they all ... and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because he gets Collins and Murkowski it'd me in the way they bowed means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony and if it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have the Gulf adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise]\nAnd I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old average I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a great to have your back\nYeah it can be on again anyway so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's ...\nProbably possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she made all literally believe that men have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine [noise] hooked on it if not better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive\nBy media or making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written

news breaks out we break in when you watch the gay West Germany ... God and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five ... okay\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm with Johnson both Republican and democratic lawmakers are taking on the president after he said this about Christine Blasey Ford's testimony at a rally last night\nI had one well do you think it was you know it was what it is a good\nOf a well with companies being fired a it has been since Trump was inaugurated even during the transition it's been a series of steps or efforts to get rid\nOf Donald Trump to overthrow the election results with two thousand sixteen and I think Christine boldly Ford is an element of that whole movement or that whole desire\nDemocrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the FBI\nThe deal Jay people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it now that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin on with not sit there and let his\nLife to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego was such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's\nJust many screwed it they were carried ski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened to ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators when women out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even\nMcConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell\nThat would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why the sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occur in not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the\nMid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early\nEighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance her testimony\nReveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes at her convenience first Ford's testimony\nThe assault occurred in the summer of Ninety two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot the war and you'll people about this to Eighteen today\nThere is an emergency warning system test\nIt just happened to my watch started going crazy\nAnd I'm going to lead the test is just the past it's not an Amber Alert it's just a test that if if
