have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern\nAmerican leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and it's designed this founded and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration to do it in the Snow White Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so\nWhat did he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health\nCare for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transfer America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nSome of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back looking there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken a [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see even though it may be anecdotal\nEvidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify\nA some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and

one of its target to the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are

being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just\nTargeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that

[noise]\nUm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA sheep in those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and they test my she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yeah it was a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my client yep\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\n...\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it Stanley it goes down and a quarter and then because all of this is about to come out\nNext not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser\nA pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that and Grassley said there's a lot more there are many more examples of balls before and witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence and if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this but wouldn't change one Democrat Senate both\n\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\n... well the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy ... ... to ... uh\nUh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI report the Republicans and Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered ...\nCombined knowledge none of the center to grassroots so forth they are not mentioned what we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense you were sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing to commit\nPerjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories\nWhich then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they have not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate and now it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge it's not about the nature of the yeah but\nI never knew Rochelle Mickey I miss work\nWhen

mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the judiciary\nCommittee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is animated this week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer remind US Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with the polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passage attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have\nClaimed it's a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide there and he writes I urge you once again now for the third\nTime in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs

you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones infant disease on it or are they\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five this was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I\nThey saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin on the floor that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out\nHere and\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right\nHere on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth ... I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats\nLike this fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh jihadists sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed\nThat if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nSo now we're back to Monica McLean walls ease buddy who helped her write a letter from her home in robot Delaware\nGuess what McLean is a former FBI agent said to have worked as a spokesperson\nFor for Preet Bharara Preet Bharara former staffer for Senator Schumer he went on to become us attorney southern district for New York so Trump fired him and uh and now he is one of the biggest never Trump or is out there\nMcLean is lawyer is David last minute and from the archives the Washington Post February ... this guy was

helped her well that would be Monica McQueen at who's home ... was in ... Delaware at the time the letter was written McLean former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is the walls e Ford is is using people that are tired and linked at the hip and the heart and the brain to Democratic Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David off men helped oversee the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private\nEmail server problem which she was exonerated\nAnd the last ... also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six name\nSo how is it the balls the Ford ends up in the home\nOf a woman who is tied to the D. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen if you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz er Palo Alto\nAnd you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein the next thing you know\nWell no no no that ... you sound fine signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he not a woman which is\nSo you're just you're a beach Bab psychology professor whatever from California and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tell you that the committee's willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I ... I I Will you I Would have welcomed view is my home if you\nHad ... I don't even think I buy this\nThey she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean\nShe didn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had to come to Washington\n\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia

... one vote the Senate has advanced Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation one of the fifty one yeses came from Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona who called for a pause in the

no she said he is just not\nThe right man for the Supreme Court right now just not the right man\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that

signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dasa they and and a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch a leftist in charge of those issues in her state there's this shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly\nBe in unison with me too movement [noise] so I mentioned that we had a couple of photos of Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know\nWhen the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings

she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she's got our hands up on the wall framing Murkowski it's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning\nIn to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the general camp do you see the pain expression on the face of Murkowski\nAnd the ... of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on the digital

look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what\nFor [noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes and form so you could be

it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection\nOf public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is ... corridors seat And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody you haven't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women\nBut his point is we have no evidence Kevin did anything to anybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and they were going to deny because they committed perjury and I'm going to deny it because if your eyes at a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin or shouldn't be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kinda like the affirmative action but what one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged in it oh
