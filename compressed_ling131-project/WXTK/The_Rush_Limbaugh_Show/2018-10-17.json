I I I won't ... no I mean you will do\nThey think about what's changed in the last you know Twenty years ago Nineteen Ninety eight you know we're still not at ground zero of the Internet but we were you know when the first inning of understanding what the Internet could be thinking about the change that happened when denial of AOL yeah you'd have that\nYou know like all the the it was in you try to make a phone call and you kick your son off the Internet and then you ... you wouldn't be good like it was it was ... you\nLive oh yeah it would drive ins\nHide her up to more calls from my parents are there any like they hated it it was awful but think about how much has changed in in that twenty year period with the Internet right what we're going to see from changes in transportation\nI don't know if it's going to be quite the same just because you know the Internet is probably the most powerful invention you know in the last hundred and fifty years maybe two hundred\nBut if if this is going to be the biggest change in transportation since the invention of the airplane yeah I'll go that far on\nIt well it'll be a it'll be fun to watch\nA delayed Obama era rule on student relief is to take effect a long delayed federal intended to protect student loan borrowers\nWho were defrauded by their schools went into effect yesterday after a federal judge rejected an industry challenge and the education department ended efforts to stall any longer so what we're talking about here\nAre those crappy colleges that lied to kids to get him to come in and go to secretarial school er SBA see school and really there was it was a lousy education and there were no job prospects\nNo they they may they literally made numbers up as far as oh Ninety percent of our people are employed and it just wasn't accurate so there are more than a hundred thousand borrowers most of whom went to these for profit schools like ITT or Corinthian Colleges that have gone out of business since then\nUh and so this provides relief to those borrowers who want to be taken out those loans based on fraudulent information that was given to them\nYou know that's a lot of people owners dialing hundred thousand people on that when those loans are forgiven right yeah they're going to be able to get a credit card they're going to be able to buy a car they might be able to actually buy a house exactly the\nCause of it when you look at student loan defaults a lot of people think it's you know the doctors and the lawyers that aren't paying their student loans they're paying their student loans the the ... vast majority I was shocked when I looked at the statistics\nThe vast majority Chuck a student loans that are in default are small dollar amounts like people just almost won six or seven grand yeah and they go into default on their student loans silly you screw up your life for seven thousand bucks\nYeah it's it tends to be the smaller ones and it's either in a lot of cases people who went to these for profit colleges or people who didn't complete their degrees at for two year colleges yeah\nBut it they they like I I don't understand what the psychology is you you you you go to school maybe you can't cut it you maybe you're just not smart enough to go to college or you're not going to be willing to work hard enough to go to college and you have a three thousand dollar student loan you say well I'm not paying that\nBut then you you you you can never buy a house ... your your credit rating is permanently a destroyed until you actually make that payment yet you're always going to be in the five hundred\nTo put this in perspective we're going to be able to get a good job\nNo Nineteen percent of people attended or borrow money to go to these for profit schools thirty eight percent of the false come from them while thirty eight percent of defaults come from the office and I\nHave a doubt only down a hundred and eight points I say only because by the end the vast majority

idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in and sit by and the pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed we don't even know if they're alive but U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents everything has blown\nUp autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary and blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on them every attempt in October surprise\nThis year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along the mother is gonna get the goods on how Trump's Foley election by shooting in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with all like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but\nThey're there and look to take the reins psychologically screwed up base is probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they haven't been they've bought it\nThey drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released within this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated\nRural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather than break\nThe rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don moment is wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at any\nMoment are going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is\nImminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that point\nDisaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes so Rosenstein\nWho is technically is bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house\nWell that is an

was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program and re re booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey and we have to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became\nA a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats were fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ... and he says she only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the fresh prince ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not any more it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration in the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with\nAll the jobs and all of them are wages going up\nWhat am I ever seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have to say you should probably try being met for\nAll right to all of our listeners out

about what journalism is now this is not about\nContemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them\nIs very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [laughter] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this\nDoes it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their\nCrosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and his little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against\nThe little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names or the writer or writers I don't\nRecognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen honest this is one\nOf the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most they pick of all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file\nAnd then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is

think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more\nTrump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed\nTo him another poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved or the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare and after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets approval from only\nFive percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if\nTrump so who actually is being divisive\nCrop of the GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive buys are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nI Am I Am still in the in the process of

really think the people in this audience or so soon the Fox News' audience do you think they really need to be reminded\nTo go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of sweet as you mentioned earlier that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment and some people the Kenyan that might change some last minute ... but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican\nBut you know just get it out there to keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they're on the tenth of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... well I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I liked to assume that's why I ask you I like to assume\nThat the audience of this program is fully aware enough to just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there are here because you're concerned you here because you're educated informed and involved and investing in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously so I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're talking about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats run into how people already know that otherwise I'm looking for different
