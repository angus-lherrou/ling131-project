about it is the big ...\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change his wrong thing to say because it is a window into who Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and er and other things is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is headed to Santa fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum\nWith this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so Gillum is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion that are hanging all over him in addition to that\nHe is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collective he looks at things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leaves the inequality an unfairness\n\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guarantee of national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is this ... this you know a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me step in here and tell\nThose of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is Rhonda ... and Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general he\nHas a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time

things\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox\nAnd he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern of corruption by Andrew Gillum he pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch in breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development\nDeals pay to play so to speak\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled him of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of clout or investigation ever since he won Florida to be a sanctuary state\n[noise] he wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic American socialist who believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault\nBecause we have all been stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWe have stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there is nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out
