today in Burlington chestnut hill or Palm Beach gardens or go to seasons fifty two dot com for menu information and reservations\nJoining us on the line now is Amy hall from the net roots are here to talk about the twenty eight team jeep wrangler Rubik on any thank you for joining us\nHey you guys thanks for having me always good to talk to you\nAbsolutely so I mean where does the ruby ... fit in within the wrangler I guess a brand and it ended up itself what what exactly does that tell us about this vehicle\nSo the real big on is the top dog of their wrangler line up this is the vehicle that you want if you want to go off road completely off the grid I'm completely stock and be able to get through pretty much anything that you can throw at it\nThis is a vehicle that has excellent ground clearance excellent offered geometry\nUm it it got a a set of really really be the offer to hire 'em right and we're locker disconnecting LeVar like this is the top dog and that the price that you will be paying a fifty thousand dollars for a new deal with on it but it\nBut it is also very very good\n[noise] so let's let's talk about this thing in his element first off road ... is there anything that this this car really struggles with off road is there anything that you know as you're putting him through its paces there and say gee that might have been too much for it\n[noise] um I have not come across\nAnything that would be too much for it um I have taken it on the very\nFamous ... which the vehicle is named for and normally you don't see doc vehicles on the contrary normally the thing with um you know thirty five thirty eight and higher and you'll see things with\nFixing to live on it because it's very very difficult you're basically going over I'm older than ... rock and Boulder um\nAnd we were able to take stock river con over this I mean it's slow\nGoing it was able to do it um I just took it seven days off road I'm from Lake Tahoe down to the Mexican border through everything from the rock Johnson valley which is where a very famous awkward race uh happened poking at a hammer on all the way to the tune in Guam as with the highest in North America\nUm I did not have\nAny real problem that did not result from driver error I mean I I Will say the second one in the but not not doing the right thing\nUm but I was able to self extract thanks to the low hearing and I'm of the root cause\nAnd and the seven day competence and we were the only we were the top vehicle we won the competition in about stock vehicle we were the first vehicle when that was not modified um so if I were to get a vehicle for their zombie apocalypse it is going to be a jeep wrangler ...\nWhich is great but what if ... apocalypse doesn't actually happen what what what was really on the road because well it might happen eventually but today and tomorrow I don't see zombie so how's this thing hold up on the road\n[laughter] I Love your positive outlook I'm Still coming in two days all bets are off them though [laughter]\nOn this thing does have solid\nAxle in the front and in the rear and that can cause um\nIt can cause it to write a little bit rough on the road and that has been true in the past and it is not the mood is writing vehicle I'm offered vehicle that you would be an eye for that I Would say probably the ram Fifteen hundred or this heavy the arc you those are very very smooth on the pavement having said that\nWe I was able to cruise up and down from San Francisco to Los Angeles at about ... miles an hour and felt very very comfortable it tracks great even after driving off road on the contrary for two days or on the rebel rally for seven days\nThe thing you get it on the paper and it tracks very very straight it's not going to be a corner Carver this has been very soft there's a lot of body role when you get in return\nBut that is what makes it so great opera so there are you trade off in terms of even driving but it still makes an excellent daily driver I Will say there's not a lot of storage inside you really have to search for work hobbies and pockets to put your things\nUm and I had this off topic which was\nFine in terms of noise it's a little bit noisier\nUm but in the cold weather trying to lift the back window take that back when they're on and off to access our euro camping here that was a little hard when the weather got cold so I might go for the for the heart top\nEven though it's more difficult to take an on and off when you want to drive the thing without the top but overall I think the hard times probably a better deal\nAre good I mean we've got to run but thanks for joining us and uh stay away from his armies All right [laughter] I Will do thank you guys\nAre at the Emmy wholesome female road show talking about the twenty eight teen jeep wrangler Ruben ...\nGood call for good car for northern\nOh yeah I mean you can take that thing just about again as as you said just about any really want you

of times either you know when the beach places or are mountains\nMan they are fun to drive everywhere not on the road if you're on the road it's June ... group whatever okay but you just it it's a blast to drive\nIs your financial situation better since the twenty sixteen election we asked that pool question all morning long final results are in eighty four point eight percent of our listeners

Ninety five WMGK ...\nYears mentally brown facing a for hearing this morning the man accused of killing eleven edit Pittsburgh synagogue is now in federal custody\nAnd I what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying Democrats part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad indeed do the Republican Party for\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump and frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up\nWith it's been this way for years there were showed up to during the Obama administration there were mass murders and no time did the drive by me the ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and it's so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do and then they\nCan to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and if it\nWere getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it\nIs the person it did it we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the\nTrump well I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we end up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico [noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have\nGotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is my young men to pay attention to it it is my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many ... with this by now you would think\nThis is going to affect the mid term lay Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to return to ratchet these two\nThings up to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house no you have to take\nThese too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now they are in fact I don't know do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans once this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tuned it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support all you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemn there weren't\nAny consequences for that protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and it literally tear up a town on on why they create a lie\nAbout the shooter in that in that ... the Mike Brown ... first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now is because it is\n\nBelieves what'd you say nobody\nTrusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it's so obviously you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you can do with it politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ...

and take it you see the way this works is [noise]\nThirty six year old allegation can be made for which there is no evidence and for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place 'cause the victim doesn't aware it happened to those when the when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh\nIs supposed to sit back and just take he's just see those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\n\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was weird and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have since Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one\nThing that happened in the school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized it more gun control not answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is and it's important but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that's kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us left us [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but but what we're all for freedom as we define it he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with the Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focus on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd on and tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump as an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe worst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling them\nSilent crime it's why people have life like have light flock to protect them from every kind of identity theft see when you have a life lock you'll know immediately when some\nAnd he's running around on you because you have an online profiling lifelike tracks when there is any aberration any change at least like they let you know and ask you what's going on if you know about it or if you don't\nAnd if you don't that's when they get into gear and they've got a\nA response team restoration deemed does nothing but fix these kinds of hacks or identity theft and they don't stop till it's done it's the way you know you have been a victim of cybercrime along before you otherwise would and that's how it got shut down\nNow look nobody or no one company can prevent all identity theft but there's nobody in life locks

Tampa as we head back to the phones welcome sir great to have you here with us\nThanking Russia I mean if something rash where we didn't need it when that little thing when when they ... they have their little team got Obama was up to his eyeballs in hardcore anti Semite like Al Sharpton in and out of the White House over a hundred times [noise]\nTwenty years old Don extent in that hard core anti Semitic church Jeremiah Wright's church\nAnd they photographed them Obama yeah you know with that world class Jew hater\nOr lower tier cannot wear\nWhat they said Julia when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they can say damn war that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not Obama what's their guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight ... well spoken highly educated reasonable academic intellectual um and in look in the leftist world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama for hanging around ... semi like Farrakhan agenda Robert Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks may feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that could have said that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable way they have excuses you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was Farrakhan standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him\nAnd many drive by news organizations cropped Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but\nIt's ... this is the point we have a two tiered justice system and we clearly have a two tiered political system we have criminalized\nRight wing or conservative Republican politics and policy and at the same time exempted from any criticism or criminality\nUh most of the\nPolicies of the politics of the left but I understand your anger it's light and democracy and they're never held accountable to that\nTime

I ... in your opinion based and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey\nWhen they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because what I say\nThat yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much\nAnti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\nBecause it's a lot because it's anti religion it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if I had the religion is high but religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes that no way that it's a disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a ... because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian to do um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being assume Islam\nBut I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... pie\nThat's exactly right this is where Mrs all headed\nThis is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no\nUltimate power that can meet out approve or disapprove hurtful ones that's been one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so ... how this of this event in Pittsburgh given\nEverything else that you say that you are the old the liberalism to creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't\nI don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she got the thing is I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I\nMean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they're predominant by thank you thank you so much\nRachel I purchased racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk\nAnd his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think the odds are to the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second event happens\nOn

S. T. K.\n[noise] ABC Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be established something they cannot be proven but yet there is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] [noise] you know\nI don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international political expert\nAt what have you and I used to think of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation to the point that a lot of what will people ask me what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on there just ripping Trump I knew one who primarily from the standpoint that Trump's\nManners and his behavior and his ah compartment just isn't\nPresent control and you know the usual complaint from the establishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but no one left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra leftist\nHeart what it says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue in the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean\nEvery day the left is politicizing everything including\nMass murder wherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr boat simply because we don't believe in the Mad Men climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism is successful many or why the mainstream maybe\nIs extremism if you asked me that's what they've become daily media reporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual\nIt certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in his audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first\nHour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected and precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody wants to talk about him that way but Trump dead\nAnd so they all start laughing as they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump leading and their size\nIs not going to last this craziness Trump tapped\nSlowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary and all of them had this preferable a laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want Trump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nickname ... and so forth\nAnd they fought this just to sit it\nCan't happen to these camps that you've never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool and that is\nThe real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that\nI or anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he is doing in corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election\nI don't care how much power you think I've got I couldn't come close to doing what was done and has been done the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lives five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for\nTwo years Mr boat for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping they were hoping\nAnd they live with every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThat there wasn't any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on the FBI the D. OJ they knew the tricks being played and they willingly\nSupported those tricks they ignored\nThe real collusion and rigging elections and a part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think we've got over here on conservative\nMedia we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup\nUsing the upper reaches of power at the department of justice all Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists we no way we wouldn't have the power to plant\nI'm about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you were if you do things and give people more safety more control if you're giving people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to that all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where does it it's absurd where where's it hadn't\nYet my thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except see the lessons you you know we have gun free zones schools now you can't put guns in there the only people get in with guns and the bad guys you people up [noise] um the left thinks that's the way it should be\nThat if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left as the problems all the presidents of guns means [noise]\nThere'll be a when you went to the local News Good afternoon I'm ... with this nobody likes decay innings update this weekend's\nNor'easter love twelve hundred every source customers on Cape Cod without power\n... spokesman read Lambert he says the storm with wind gusts to sixty miles an hour resulted in downed power lines in both born in her which utility crews that power restored wall customers on the Cape by Sunday\nIn province town of fishing vessels sank McMillan war it's believed the if the search your was pushed under the war by Saturdays high wins and was pushed underwater when the time came in\nProvince town harbor master personnel placed booms around the area in the event of a fuel leaker crane was able to lift the fishing boat from under the war\nAccuse synagogue shooter Robert Bauer his appearance in Pittsburgh courtrooms no over you only answered yes or yes surge to the judge's questions and seem calm when conversing with his attorney\nPowers faces twenty nine charges in connection to the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday the left eleven people dead and six others injured\nWB is eaten Boston early warning whether calling for a mostly sunny afternoon with a hundred and fifty eight tonight mostly clear with all over I'm forty one right now it's sixty in Hyannis I'm Bernie news radio Ninety five WMGK we'll check Cape Cod traffic coming up\nYou have to ... every week but a friend in your hand\nMade possible by me of course you know uh if you really want to give credit where credit's due if I live at five after the hour every hour starting at six am one thousand dollar thank you for having us nowhere else to go but thank you for that or no thank\nYou for regular now regardless of who's responsible may be a sign that wouldn't be\nMaking a grand in your hand on your radio Ninety five ...\nK.
