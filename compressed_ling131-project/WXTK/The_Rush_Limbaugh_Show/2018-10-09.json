hill or Palm Beach gardens or go to the seasons fifty two dot com for menu information in reservations booked your holiday party today and get a special gift for all your guests\nI I I feel bad because I've already been talking about the holiday shopping season I think yesterday and today because there's been a little bit of news about it so I Can't help myself but we're now into force that we're allowed to start thinking about it from at least a a earnings perspective and FAO Schwarz\nIs making an international pushing also reopening their flagship store in New York\nA head of the season you know we we hear so much about everything going on line and bricks and mortar closing down but the fact the matter is\nBricks and mortar is still a great differentiate or for companies if it becomes a destination and let's face it everyone knows the FAO Schwarz in New York City if you're drawing a blank here I didn't come along to yeah it's a tourist attraction ... exact\nAnd you know they are smartly in my opinion opening up again I'm ends at thirty rock you know right by NBC pretty good timing with Toys R us just causing every single one of those okay hats and and you know like I said it's a it's a tourist destination that people in there you know get a lot of talk or\nGet it's definitely a luxury ... that's a luxury toy brand new when they were open back when you have like personal shoppers and your hair you would have concierge type services so I mean it's Manhattan It's over the top it's that's what it's supposed\nTo be and they're also going to pop up shops in Spain Australia and London for the holiday season people go in there and get some very nice expensive ideas\nYou know it's going to be the other interesting show among all the other companies that are trying to pick on the toys are us or you know abstinence um party city\nThey do to you know those Halloween yup shops that they do a ... year they're also going to do toys city ... they're going to take that same space that they rent for Halloween and open up these little toy pop up shops to try and gobble up some of the toys are us absence that we're going to have this year\nAnd a get a lot of people like to go these stores and see the stuff in person than a find out how goofy they look in those outfits\nOr whatever you know and you know at whole foods doing what Amazon's giving up\nA toy brochures to whole foods shoppers ah okay here's the pressure and all that stuff and all the crap that we sell on Amazon dot com that you can buy for your kid that you know trying to grab everything in the store smart move ... smart move getting these pop up stores people will definitely go there and they'll spend money I think so\nThree housing trends to watch this fall job we've talked about the real estate market extensively and some weaknesses that we're seeing what what do we what are we should we be looking at this fall\nWell you know the bottom line is despite this huge recovery and you know in almost all of our the recoveries the key issue was housing business recovery that's been fantastic and housing simply hasn't come on housing starts\nHave or have not done well housing stocks are doing very poorly right now\nAnd I suddenly keep an eye on to see the things could get even worse is Ken rates stay under five percent if they go about five percent it's going to walk a lot of people out of the market yeah a ... will prices ease up on the gas pedal a this is something to keep an eye on two we\nHave seen so this is three months in a row now where we've seen the year over your home prices the median home prices nationwide increasing it less than five percent and that hasn't happened since ... fourteen so clearly we're seeing some deceleration anyway we're not seeing every adoption and home prices are seeing some\nDeceleration in the increase we're seeing you know buyers and sellers coming together and getting it equilibrium price that seems reasonable I don't hear the stories about Fifteen bids over asking price anymore exactly\nAnd I saw a number that I think is reflective of what's going on here the ratio at banks\nOf loans to deposits\nIs the lowest in forty years which means banks are sitting on a lot of capital and they're not lending it out and in part it's because\nA lot of people applying don't qualify because these prices to hide their incomes don't justify it and on top of those a lot of regulations that have precluded a lot of one thing this is going to be an interesting issue as we go forward to get banks to kind of open up and start writing business because it was just the opposite extreme eleven years ago\nYeah young by are still really aren't in the marketing force ah twenty five thirty five year olds are thirty six point five percent homeownership rate\nThat still well below where Gen x ers were at the same point in time and a number of different factors can point to where there'd be student loans are not getting married yet still yeah millennials are not buying homes at the same rate that their parents and grandparents were buying them\nNowhere near but the trend here is encouraging because millennials are now starting to increase their share and I look forward I think a lot of this purchase has been delayed not put off\nUm and I think you go see a lot of people doing in their thirties with previous generations did in their twenties and it's going to be a huge boon I think for housing going forward\nI keep here everyone pointing to hey you know great news you don't need to put twenty percent down ever you know everyone says oh you need you know you need to be buying a home with twenty percent down and\nThat's clearly not the true because not true because of all these programs that we have I really don't love these programs that exist though I mean I Know that they're important get first time homebuyers in the house but ... are we going back to some of the issues we saw back in the early to thousands comes out of the\nIssue of scholarships for students going to college the more money your hand out the more prices actually go up you know the easy you make credit in terms of low down payments the more likely you are to get people to buy more house than\nMaybe they should write and got VA loans guaranteed by the department of veteran affairs or require no downpayment right kind of agree with that one uh USDA loans allow people to buy rural homes without much of a down payment so\nI don't think we're running into an issue there but you something to keep an eye for an eye on it yeah it's all the time we have today for the financial exchange stay tuned tomorrow or John Mooney Mike I'm showing ... Silverstein off today than she turned into financial exchange radio network [noise]\n\nTo proceedings that paid for advertising by the financial exchange it does not reflect the views court opinions

ambassador Nikki Haley is set to step down the announcement came from the president and a bastard or Hayley in the oval office\nPrice so you're saying she ... she believe balls the\nOrange was righteously indignant offended over the white Trump treated mostly foreign than the cabinet gets confirmed that she can't handle it anymore now we don't know this I'm just\nPointing out areas where she's publicly disagreed with the president\nPoppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about nor did anybody I don't want this is a classic example of they found out Nikki Haley I'm going to be approximate what the time here they found out that Nikki Haley was going to resign at ten o'clock and for an hour cable news had nothing much speculation as to why they couldn't just wait\nThey couldn't just wait for the announcement and the video tape from the oval office where she in Trump percent into bright\nYellow chairs by the fireplace couldn't wait no end to fill that time was speculation and that's when people really get dumb when all kinds of wild guess speculation that's where people try to show their smart smokes the ads were\nAll these animals and commentators try the demo\nThere in siders status and their operatives knowledge and so forth some of the things that I heard being bandied about\nSimply made no sense but\nMuch of it as they say made for great TV [noise]\nIt wasn't complicated at all she just wanted to leave at nothing to do with Kavanaugh it had nothing to do with ... and had nothing to do with the Supreme Court it's simply had to do with the calendar and something she had said this was going to happen long ago\nI in terms of the um\nIdea that she's upset she before there's another rumor going around\nSochi and now she's going to resign and she's going to run against prop uh twenty twenty that she hates prompt the ears of the barriers them Trump it just didn't get it and it and it's going to run for the Republican nomination in\nTwenty twenty\nSo she headed that offered the past before the press even started asking questions is no I'm not running in twenty twenty and the only thing I'm going to be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy and she pointed at\nTrump\nYou good to hear about when to come out of the sales collectively of the drive by media who were\nConvinced that a woman was abandoning Trump because of ... because of capital\nHere's our oh buddy nic Robertson above all maybe all time favorite CNN and foreign correspondent and here is a nic Robertson this morning on CNN I'm guessing back and forth with the info bay poppy Harlow about Nikki Haley's reason\nOn the issues that allies have one for the the President Trump to be tough on ... in particular Russia because that was one that he seemed\nTo be sensitive on on not one that he wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany or the whole thing states have a one sentence Nikki Haley has been a source of conflict so if you're one of the United states enemies and Nikki Haley stepped out of his position than perhaps you breed a tiny bit easier\nI look [noise] I\nI'm just I'm just a radio talk show guys here and Nick Robert so does this season broadcast journalist but I'm Sorry\nThis is so full of its let's go back to the top of his son ... on the issues that I'll buy as one of the street Trump be tough on in particular Russia because that's the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one but he just wanted to push\nUs allies in Britain and France and Germany to booming states have all wanted to be tough\nHas every button it kept you forgotten how Trump ... Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal at the G twenty with the Russians\nHave forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel omega psi deal with them for natural\nGas and it was Donald Trump that could not believe in and called her out on it and suggested that she could have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the streets wanting to G. H. G. Fifteen or the gene whatever\nTrump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump Trump Russia collusion story\nHad been discredited thoroughly Trump has not been a Russian puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson of\nThat oh no they got these ideas in their head and Trump and Russia\nThat these will be involved eight people had to be

that exist in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under assault it has never been\nWorse than a

could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept\nOf America as mountains some people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and\nI I I've uh just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and may be present some\nSolutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real\nThreats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us and they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how to pray saved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campus well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my\nThoughts [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein

you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaning Democrat I guess this is according to polling data two hundred and Eighteen is the number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrats I'm exist if the Democrats
