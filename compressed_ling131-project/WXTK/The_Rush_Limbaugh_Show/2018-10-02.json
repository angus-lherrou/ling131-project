called\nPrices start as low as a hundred thirty dollars for a twin sized bed I'm surprised it's taken Amazon this long to get into this because if there was an industry in the whole world ripe for disruption I Would think it will be mattresses this is one of the highest profit margin businesses on the planet\nBut I Want the the reason I have there's a million companies are you in in a box or ship it to your house set Casper lease a top the needle you name it right there are all over the place but I Will violent I Need a mattress ... because I Want to test it [noise] yeah let me see I I\nThink if you're interested in getting a high end mattress this is not the route to go though I I think you know going to the local store and paying you know Fifteen hundred thousand dollars plus you can find one that you'll like yeah\nI think what this is going to do though and I was shocked to talk about this as you know you forget the cheaper ones they're they're terrible like in that seven Ninety nine eight Ninety nine inch there's like a few that are good if you live a terrible and it's a real hit or miss thing like you don't want to buy it online because a few people like\nWhere are these things may I think in the states or in Mexico or we're not company oh in general I I think not only two or three mattress companies that supply literally all the mattresses in North America yeah\nI'm In I think mattress pheromones most of it I think they're they're like they bought up most of their competition\nBut I think what this could do is if if the Amazon gets into this and really disrupt the business\nThose Fifteen hundred to two thousand dollar mattresses the ... the higher quality mattresses might be available for like the mid range price but seven Ninety nine eight Ninety nine and I think if that's the case you know if I was in the market for a mid priced one\nI take my chances and also knowing that Amazon allows you to do returns\nYeah it's huge I mean how do you return to king size and I I I mean that's obviously going to be the number one question across the board when ordering a mattress on line yeah I'm sure they were you know address that with a simple solution um yeah but most of these companies are offering Ninety Days to try a mattress I think that's plenty of title it is absolutely I I Would agree\nWith that but I I think it will be successful because they're because wherever there are large margins Amazon come in and disrupted them and there's no industry that as fat or margins than the mattress industry yeah well they're willing to lose money\nAmazon yeah they've shown that uh they become more disciplined about that in recent years which is one of the reasons why the stock is doing well but uh this is they'll put\nMattress from out of business and then raise the price is right that that's that's how they do but the mattress\nCompanies are are making so much money you can go to small towns that have very little in terms of commerce and they have a beautiful mattress store in part because I was listening or freakonomics broadcast that said you could just like two or three ... a week really and make pretty good money

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England

choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops and at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional bats or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain a bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter

there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where ... fine old current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything

something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see if there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's they only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after our founding and Clinton have blamed it\nAin't right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going\nTo accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n[noise] Michigan Militia shortwave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't the by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know\nI Know how they lie and make things up and strategize I Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick that was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine ... the artist that his cartoonish interpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma\nCity bombing the fire was a no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of this ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter]\nSome public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do\nAs a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot camera and you don't have to remember you'll be able to see it I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them same cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vile\nIt's filthy if dirty and disgusting it's despicable and it's sick\nAnd of course it has accomplished it's objective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it and I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it in my never\nEnding quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin on his daughter says another prayer dear God forgive my angry\nLying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just that flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives have suffered psychological and some of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nSo don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did\nOn CNN NBC News desperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia\nNBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat\n\nUnable to independently

let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wise here it is number nine\nSheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet clearly if they have been given a free rein to interview my wife says that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight\nThis is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and\nThat means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is actually throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of shore we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more than I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this\nThis is of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committed I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named\nAnd didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\n[noise] and I was
