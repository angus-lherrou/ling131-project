{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "For another ... ... thanks up stuff and you did you want to read but yeah I have a point now made that I agree with is that the overregulation in health care this is one more regulation and I think we all probably can agree with that that healthcare is one of the most regulated industries in the world and that a lot of it makes good sense and a lot of it doesn't make good sense and this is a regulation that\nBoth the burden and the inability to wrap our arms around it and actually do it and succeed is impossible\nNot so much your outfit I don't think but the Cape cod hospitals of the world the film of hospitals of all all the big hospitals those Stephanie I think that does have a point and it concerns me because of the graying of America tickle me on Cape Cod it's on steroids ... a lot of elderly people they require more care\nAnd and that's just making a big deal out of because it is a big deal about quality of care\nAnd I'm listening to that and I'm Wondering if ... is right that Patrick\nWhich would you prefer to have a you know you're a nurse have six or seven of you to care for only maybe three or four of you when you know which one I Would go with Stephanie so she right about that that we have a quality of care issue throughout the country frankly just because there are more older people hospitals are having to do with the airport\nSo absolutely the are especially on Cape Cod the population is aging at a faster clip than the rest\nYou know we have a ... or older population here but again I Would point to all the surveys that show that Massachusetts hospital rankings aren't the best in the country we're number one I'm In one study where California's Seventeen and leap frog which is a well regarded on national sort of clearing house for quality information\nMassachusetts is ranked for California's twenty five so to tie it to nurse stopping I don't think is the answer the answer is on us doing all the mandatory things that we have to all ready in terms of reporting and fixing problems as they occur in health care\nCare about in in your opinion in Massachusetts is going to go on the slide if we don't support this question\nIs it it has been that's that's how this whole thing started and there are about as I said earlier there about nine hospitals that already do it they can do it and not all of them are smaller I Won it totally escapes me\nBut we have tried everything from legislatures as I told you committees contracts everything\nIt has to pass it will pass but it doesn't appear out in the statistics of quality but it depends upon what study\nYou use as the center of Medicare the sand mess\nWhich I think I ... I I think though that certainly has a point in so much is it also seems to me it matters which kind of facility we're talking about even this ballot question is all registered hospitals so that the students Stephanie's world ... hospital so she's on equal par with Brigham and women's that's an entirely unfair\nThing to lay on on on different size institutions\nBut I Would sit found this hospital versus the ... the patients are still in there there's still sex is\nStill going to require care and there's no reason than a nurse should take more than four no matter what hospital one un quick a phone\nCall 'cause we're just about a time when we have it or not caffeine Rochester is on Hi Cathy you're on next week I go right ahead with Stephanie about\nI don't know for your girls I wanted it to the locker keen\nTo emergency room because um I mean I I have an elderly modern life in a nightmare emergency really ... it caught up with all the opioid problem um I Wonder if you can only have a one year every four patients in the\nEmergency room and then if somebody comes in you know we're very we're able to leave and what happened there how it's going to that emergency room\nThe emergency room is broken down according to the type that patients so if you have a trauma patient come in\nAnd it'll be one to one and you know sometimes it'll be even two nurses to one patient but if you have roots routine fractured rests or pneumonia son that's for\nAnd if you have 'em urging air gee care within your facility that's five so it depends upon again demands money acuity and the patient and there'd be enough staff to be flexible and that holding the wall bet\nThat is so untrue there's never been a firefighter a paramedic in California that it's had to wait outside the ER doors\nStephanie you and I have seen that ad a lot it's got my attention ... nonsense I\nI don't think yeah sense I think that unfortunately the obviously the Q A cute trauma cases will obviously going to the emergency room be well taken care of but the ones like mild mom who falls down regularly will probably wait longer because there'll be this backup happening and and again to bring it back to Spalding which took them who I represent\nIf we can't take a patient because we don't have the right staffing and we say to Cape Cod healthcare sorry no better available we don't have the nurses to do it\nThey're med search unit is full they therefore can't have an empty bed to bring that patient up from the ER and you end up with this downstream backup of patients that I think is a very real concern as I said\nOkay I have one more thing I think the patient ratio to nurture the good thing because right now my mother in rehab one nearer to every one CNA to every patient and it's a fiasco it's there's not high enough that ridiculous\nBut I probably in a skilled nursing facility not a rehabilitation hospital though I just want ... it it did\nI hear it's good because I think it should be the ratio should be better but I think they'll be rewritten so that's a fine and it shouldn't be rewritten differently for their different guy hospital it should be rewritten I think the I hear it's good but the bail out your water time and maybe are delivered rewritten\n[noise] um I think people should reconsider that maybe what ... ... or getting that bill rewritten so that it makes sense\nI got to keep paying so much where we're out of time and it was a ton of calls I Apologize I knew what was going to go fast I truly not to be a pain in the neck to either one of you I I ...

potentially me or my family people I care about friends you know you're lying in a hospital bed bearded at Cape Cod hospital or up in Boston at a Mass General wherever it may be\nAnd you may ... may not be on death's door but you're up there you're sick and as a as Beth picnic what am I guess last hour said to me hey Patrick\nWhere would you prefer to have a your nurse have you know three or four patients you being one of them or would you prefer your nurse to having like six or seven of your well I knew the answer is obvious I prefer to have our him have less patience to do to a care for\nThe more ah but this ballot question number one [noise]\n[noise] and I don't think it's entirely a case of well it's just greedy CEOs\nI have no doubt as a variable by the way but I don't think it's all of this argument [noise]\nUm some concerns that I have maybe some of you can and in light me on or or maybe you agree or disagree with me as the ... version of this ballot question if it does pass and we voters have the decision to make on this November the Sixers question number one\n[noise] and this is important everybody should pay attention to this because if we make the wrong choice we could screw ourselves and [noise]\nYou know Cape Cod healthcare which is Cape Cod hospital found with hospitals a lot of other things you know these folks are saying the buck sink there to do this if you make us only allow a nurse on a given shift in a certain situation to have just so many patients that's a staffing issue [noise]\nAnd we're gonna have to move things around and that means they'll let certain services they provide go you're going to have to wait longer they're saying\nAnd I think it's fair they bring up the point about we're are these nurses going to come from\nAre we talking this is a state wide crushing everybody is it four hundred nurses or is it three thousand or four thousand more nurses and\nIt's a debatable point as my two well informed great gas did last hour it's debatable point no one seems to have a firm handle on that how many nurses extra nurses have to be hired if we voters passed this question on November the six about question number one\nNot answer is not clear depends on who you talk to\nClearly you're gonna have to hire more nurses some of the analysis governor Baker used a one analysis that has the figure up close to thirty five hundred more nurses and it's one of the reasons why governor Baker has come out and said no don't don't vote for this he's not going to [noise]\nAh so I think it's fair question to ask and where are you going to get the money to do this a Beth picnic one of my guest said well for example the Cape cod hospital has the money [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay I'm Stephanie I'm ... ah who works for a smaller hospital a Spalding rehab hospital of Cape Cod is is is not a Brigham and women's ... much smaller\nThey'll have to because there are registered hospitals do they have the money I mean really do they have the money if they can even find the nurses that are going to have to find [noise]\nUh to adhere to what will be state law\nI'm a I'm uncomfortable with that part of it [noise] um [noise] but yet\nWhen someone like Beth picnic who I think a has been around the block and and she knows care\nShe knows people she knows hospitals she's the type of lady she strikes me that uh if you're sick line in the bed you'd like to have ... looking over you so I Want to listen to her and she said listen to the nurse Patrick [noise] [noise]\nAnd I believe here on the Cape across as well as across the country\nA healthcare providers hospitals are under increasing care because a lot of us are getting older\nAnd the graying of America is a very real thing everybody the country is getting old\nUh the baby boomers are retiring they're getting older moving great lives but as you get older the fact of life you require more medical care what do you think all those ambulances coming from Orleans or Brewster or wherever you see them going down willow street to Cape Cod hospital what do you think they're mostly full of [noise]\nYou think they're full of accidents sometimes they are you know what the mostly full of people have had strokes people were falling in their homes it's a cab drive and and cc H. and might not write about this cc H employees listening to me right now [noise] it's a cattle rabbit people coming in they're stressed out would that care [noise]\nSo should you have higher mandatory higher nursing staffing levels at Cape Cod hospital fell in love hospital Brigham and women's Mass General Worcester spring you know this affects all these costs with a lot of hospitals we're talking about here my my inclination would be to say well yeah they probably do\nSo I don't um I don't like being so indecisive about something on the air but I really don't know what the right thing for us to do on the ballot question number [noise]\nNumber one All right let's grab phone calls from a patient ah people hear news radio Ninety five W ... we go to my friend and up in Chatham and good afternoon your how are you OK I'm good thanks yeah I\nThink you're going in the right direction first of all that is a union town because she said at the union\nAnd that always kind of gets a little flat two things there are\nDefinitely she didn't answer a lot of questions that you even put to her but when it comes to the shortage of nurses on Cape Cod or they are unionized Cape Cod healthcare covers the an egg covers the urgent care cut us Fontaine they will have to pull nurses\nFrom every single the place and they will have to close [noise] it is not\nOnly on my on money a thing it will be um the quality of home care will go right down the drain\nOr it will be disastrous or they have been people at Cape Cod hospital and accelerate positions that had been bullied\nFollowed by union people saying they must vote yes or they're going to lose their jobs this is no way to be able to handle health care he can manage carry feeling it just like the Hippocratic Oath nurses take it most of the doctors and nurses that are non unionized\nNote that this is absolutely a disaster for Cape Cod\nAnd the hospitals in I'm In Boston they've got a no outside all their interest is because most of them are non union [noise] but the case it's a little bit different we do have an older population and they're going to we're going to suffer suffer it's going to be disastrous\n... if ... if we pass this if you pass it\nWill be absolutely disastrous Fontaine will\nClose urgent care will close the van a well lose their nurses [noise]\nI'm home care it's\nNursing homes [noise] just all the nurses that just the ... and offices and things to in order to uh I put this mandate up which is\n[noise] I don't know about you but I've been in the hospital to three times in the last couple of years and it's like ... excellent care [noise] and it's been like almost a one two three one to four patients and always had an\nLTN are nurses aid or qualified CNA or some wonderful people that are working part time and going to college at night to become an earth [noise] and they're just as such\nAlso doing a great job Beth picnic a advocating a yes vote on ballot question number one she was a retired nurse at Cape Cod hospital this was important if you bother to vote maybe you do\nYou know but it's going to go out and vote on November six has a lot of important\nDecisions [noise] ah to make one of them is this and it concerns the patient to nurse limits a complicated question [noise]\nComplicated question it's not as easy as you may think or try to figure out a ... what is the right thing for us to do here so we're playing around without getting people's opinions on what they think the right thing to do here is ... and born hey Karen urine extricate good afternoon\nOr good afternoon how are you well thank you yourself\nWell thank you as well so I unfortunately didn't get to hear all of your\nProgram but I really think that we need to vote yes\nThere are definitely some quirk in this bill and it's not perfect\nHowever\nCod healthcare would need to employ two hundred and\nFifty new nurses in order to meet the mandate\nThat should be a huge indicator at least to the local area that we're extremely under staff\nI Would say the Cape cod hospital and how much has worked very hard to meet a patient limits similar to those that are being um propose\nIn some areas and not in others\nThey're not able to because they don't have enough that [noise]\nI Believe that if they need to hire as many nurses as\nA kid cut health care proclaims they would ... me too and then it would cost a huge amount of money that patients should be concerned that there's not enough nurses to go around\nAnd I think they tried very hard to keep everybody say [noise] um but ultimately ... people who are the least safe or the nurses because we have to be licensed and we have to maintain a license and we don't want to practice in an unsafe manner ... where we can't provide appropriate care for all of our patients\nAll of their families\nIt becomes a snowball effect [noise]\nSo I really think yes is inappropriate vote I think that there are ways to circumvent some of the time limits to be prepared if it's absolutely necessary there are some um [noise] nurses that have applied to Cape Cod hospital Cape Cod hospital is trying to\nIncrease the level of professionalism up their nursing staff so they require bachelor's degrees now which is different from other hospitals not every hospital requires that so that limits their um their applicant pool for the\nTime [noise] yeah you know when I did not because I Know some ladies who were better getting going to nursing school right now and I don't believe either has a college degree isn't that interesting\nOkay so that didn't added something\nThat maybe could be would allow Cape Cod healthcare to er Cape Cod hospital to perhaps appeal\nFor an\nEye for an additional amount of time\nTo meet those numbers but the bottom line is ... patients goat to acute care facilities because they require nursing care nurses I Want to do the best job possible and take care of their patients\nAnd they can't do that if they have so many patients [noise] that they're rushing through each bedside visit so\nAlthough I agree that there are unintended consequences\nThink that the people who are advertising to boat you know have a lot more money than the people who are advertising so yes [noise]\nThat money might be put to better use\nAnd I recently saw an ad about holding the wall in California holding a wall is not new we don't see it a lot here on Cape Cod because\nWe have such a limited a force of E. M. t.s and paramedics we really try to get them back out on the street is ... as soon as possible so they can get back to their home base\nSo whenever we can patients usually are brought in and [noise] and rescue is relieved [noise]\nBut Boston has had a paramedic than the MPs holding a while for years I've seen it with my own eyes they have to keep their patients safe until there's room in the emergency room for them to be said\nThat is the way of the world that you you can't make a building any bigger than it already is which really isn't about how many nurses there it's how much space than how many beds there are existing already so\nSome of those things you would never know if he didn't work in health care and I think they're being presented I'm barely at this point\nIn time the governor a current governor Baker came up during the day against this and some of the things that he is a citing\nConcerns me one of them is the smaller hospitals one of our guests last hour uh uh uh the the woman from Spalding rehab hospital made this very point they are not a Cape Cod hospital they certainly are not uh bring them in women's or a Mass General there are small operation but yet this is passed by you and I\nJust would across the board all registered hospitals would have to adhere to the increase in stopping and she's telling me it's not there the ... the the nurses you're asking us to put in we don't think are there and certainly the money\nOr the resources that we would be required to have to come up with it is not there now you may say well she's lying I don't think she is like but that concerns me what do you think about that point\nI think you know I I don't know a lot about the business end and where the money comes from and where it goes\nUp so I you know when they're saying the money's not there I I Can't really speak to that that's not part of my job my job is really never to worry about the money so much as worry about the patient [laughter] so I'm not sure about that\nAnd as far as the staff being available I work with a ... many per diem nurses and pre DM nurses\nTypically um\nAre nurses are usually with experience always with experience the Cape cod healthcare who choose not to be permanent nurses that the hospitals so they keep they make a commitment of a certain number of shift\nPer cycle that they make themselves available to fill in for a vacation or sick time or whatever [noise]\nMany of those nurses [noise] have stated that they'd be willing to work permanently [noise]\nThe patient ratios were\nAppropriate because it is so stressful to take on some of the patient assignments that are given to permanent nurses\nAnd of course that's our livelihood and our job and so we are expected to be there every day where per diem nurse can choose to work one or two days a week and not the wrath\nSo it's possible that some of those per diem nurses who have great experience and education would be available to take permanent position if in fact the ratios workplace\n[noise] you said the case well amount of time by the way a caring if you go to the high hard app type in ... all the podcast my shows are up there and you can hear last hours if you want it to who was a pleasure chatting with you thank\nYou thank you Bye bye I Know there's a ton of people waiting by the way before you need a break don't Eugene\nFor we take this break let me tell you the politics of this year's Charlie bakers uh opponent Democrat Jay Gonzalez has been a supporter of question one ballot question number one\nFor well over a year his campaign says we need to ensure that there isn't cost cutting\nGoing on that his compromising the health and safety of patients that was the big point that Beth picnic was making last hour every body to me and to all view\nThe reason we want to vote in favor of ... question number one bottom line patient safety patches Maris here will take a break continue with your phone calls you're listening to news radio Ninety five ...

back to the phones we go with the von in California and Nevada California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\n... an app but when I'm using up like ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I thought it was good his fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on a public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that earlier today and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun yeah can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or paper daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to Sweden which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right course songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has to be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your line and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on their cars like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this was the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nBe heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and get them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right and they're\nAll coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security or a\nBorder patrol now if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line and sixteen of you

will say that it's beating eighty one beats per minute I tried it out myself\nChinese tech site advocates report this past week the toilet paper is having a viral moment because fitness tracker owners have discovered they just play a heart rate when attached to her role\nThey also tested others cylinder objects a bottle a can a banana even an appendage of a stuffed animal all of which showed this
