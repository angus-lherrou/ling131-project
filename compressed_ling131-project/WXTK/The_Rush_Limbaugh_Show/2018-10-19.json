{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Disney marvel empire they cancelled that after two seasons 'cause you know it just wasn't a show that a lot of people really into so I think that's like taking a lot of risks and you know many of them are paid off but it's just a lot of money that they continue to spend I think that is you know on stand for the long term\nBut one of the things that I find interesting here is this is a market over all of this year that even though it's it's still up somewhat for the year it's the market that's gotten cheaper because earnings growth has outstripped what we've seen as far as appreciation for the broad market\nNetflix isn't in that situation they've gotten more hype and who say they're definitely not so their company even with this quarter you could make the case it's it's riskier today than it was at the beginning of the year still\nYeah I think that that is a very good argument that gets to the counter that I Would add to that is that Netflix seems to be treated in this club like Amazon or you know\nCan you be overvalued for two decades that mean that really you know when it comes to Amazon ... always been overvalued type yeah and it keeps going up and up and up and I think it's really just because\nPeople have faith in what Jeff Fager doing it and then the numbers kinda you know prove it with all the growth there and I think with Reid Hastings that not like you have a similar ah you know argument this kind of a\nCult that the c._e._o. sort of a warship if you will people really seem to think that they can't do anything wrong\nPolling terms of competition for ...\nBut you know we we we were asking this earlier this week in terms of who the biggest competitors are\nIn my opinion one that's not a pure streaming service but HBO just because they have that subscription model in a hundred and thirty million subscribers worldwide obviously they've they've got that good base that's already built in\nYou've got companies like Hulu you've got companies like Amazon who even though they don't put it out they still have a big streaming service who is the biggest competitor in your opinion four foot right now\nYeah it's a tough question I think what's really difficult to try and figure out with regard to competition a lot of people talk about how competition could be bad for any of these services\nMy counter to that would be that as long as the broader economy is doing well\nIt's not really a kind of binary option I Know that many people say well you know what I'm not going to subscribe to HBO even last game of Thrones because I only can afford Netflix and I want to watch the final season of arch the new black I think people are\nVery ... consumers of\nStreaming content right now and you know most people I Know they they have an Amazon corruption for the Amazon shows they watch HBO they watch Netflix and you know various authors as well I think it is going to be interesting to see whether or not the Disney Fox\nStreaming service that launches next year takes away some of the you know a traction from Netflix but uh you know even there I'm not so sure that people are going to drop Netflix just to go to it\nBut one of the things that's missing from Netflix right now if you will get all these other services out there\nThey all have some other kind of lived content they can offer whether it's you know Amazon has been Thursday Night Football games and some soccer games even Twitter has some of those uh you know obviously the legacy players like a Disney and Fox have sports news and things like that\nAny cheddar but Netflix getting heavier into those areas because that's the one thing that seems to be missing from their portfolio right now\nYeah it definitely is something that uh you don't have right now but I think for the most part it's not something that I think ah you know they really feel a need to get into especially when you look at how\nWhat streaming the streaming media explosion kind of it on the TV in general I mean live TV seems in many respects to be\nAn antiquated notion unless you're talking about a big sporting event or or some\nBig news event or you know because of people's very busy lives time shifting is kind of what people do and if you don't necessarily have to have\nAppointment live TV yeah as a a draw I think it really is more about having that attractive appealing content that you get to watch whenever you have time to watch it whether or not that\nYou know two o'clock in the afternoon if you work

behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how the drive by and media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for removed from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House\nThat has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders of the interagency abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W.

I all I can say that these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and from the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has been on foot wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over oh I don't\nI agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nBut my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right\nOn the moon right there that was for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even taking a foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nThe leaders in both parties do not want that ball it's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment\nThe swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he is a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ...

first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare\nRepeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump

get to the production I made last night on hand today about the mid term elections and the Fox them and asking them all day to react to it so that some of the sun by that we that we have coming up\nA lot of other stuff you're on the roster as well which I I thought I was going to be able to get two of the first hour but habits will try to make up for lost ground here when we get back there's only one hour left this week or so hang on [noise]\nAnd so when news breaks out we break in when you watch the gay West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Brian Clark secretary of state Mike Pompeo beginning a tour of Central America in Mexico city with a meeting with his Mexican counterpart regarding a caravan of about Fifteen hundred Central American migrants that's making its way north\n\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory and then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues and I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that wouldn't dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of my one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children for Mother's Day and this guy\nWho's up to speed on this stuff says Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rushed the pictures look bad we got to do some pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was the guy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures of what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people complained to me about Trump's separating ... I Can't defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming through you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races but we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew them\nBut there are four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe a pure objectively like this ... if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom they'll hammer or anti ...

Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nYou are not buying into his or her syndicated are they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count votes like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats ... totally out of these has everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that is going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me that's just totally abs and I'm\nIn a in a what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that as a result of polling and I know as well as anybody\nThe polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite I'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six day and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates him [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats\nHave they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing an behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a\nCouple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one\nAttempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening\nIn America they have in that\nContinued to try and portray America as as unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats has reversed\nAgain I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim\nA wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason\nWhy one was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single pulled out for the shows this happening\nPrecisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo far this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every\nI I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be

a a that was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white\nCollar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally
