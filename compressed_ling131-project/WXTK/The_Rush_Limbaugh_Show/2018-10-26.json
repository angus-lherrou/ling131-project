of national intelligence James Clapper\nWorried the recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them a blow\n'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people

people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a

I'm going to say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of each state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or a blue wave I'm Sorry ...\nAnd I think I think these folks know that there's no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that ... and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think these package bombs are means of disrupt the news elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state they're not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back so\nAll of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say the election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy up urban he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone not cheering hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated it you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about\nLetting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy and this campaign is no public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are\nConfronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this kind of behavior\nThey chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant dishes what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people's the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us\nAnd our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no wringing its hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter so we\nTalk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here in the high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this man I mean if you [laughter]\nIf you wanted to decorate\nAnd dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you\nAre a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he\nThe black leaders something else in in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement\nHe was very gracious toward the work done to bring this vile this gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice and I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators on a drive\nBy media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing it for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you're white you weren't just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox\nCalled Trump a total front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and division\nThey will say that Trump was on believe oblique brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit\nThey'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it remember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as on involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the ... the room the Obama effect has not responded that we're going to they're going to accuse Trump [noise]\nBack in a second\nI'm feeding the favorite ... she can you update the barn health board approved a measure on Wednesday to bump the age to purchase tobacco products up to Twenty

record year we have gone back in time ... NBA games in bail bondsman everywhere\nJust to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for everything that was going wrong including his own policy and Obama\nWould never even always position himself as an outsider a up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I marveled at this and how the how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable I mean all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing\nNever called him on well here's Trump out there and he's acknowledging law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this as if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words [noise] okay for those of you're watching on the digital camera here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ...\nAnd his band as is the case
