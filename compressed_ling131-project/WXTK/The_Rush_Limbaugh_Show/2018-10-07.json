issue [laughter]\nI'm I'm a local guy this Cape Cod or thinks it's it's if it's not the issue it's certainly top one to ... uh on Cape Cod and play\nAnd ah you dare not ignore and depending on what we do on the shark problem and the CEO problem it's again speaking of directions which direction do you want your Cape Cod to go in the environmental is like\nAtlantic white shark conservancy which are extremists [noise] uh in their advocacy for sharks I don't think they care so much about the seals but they realize if you get rid of the seals or get rid of the sharks and then on that because we are a petri dish to these characters [noise] or if they get their way\n[noise] and they're not the only environmental extremist group we have you also have public officials who are also not environmentalist they're extremists in their views about this if they get their way only speak for myself my Cape Cod is going to continue to go in a vastly\nDifferent direction than I Want it to [noise]\n[noise] and there is really only one answer my fellow Cape Cod her only want to answer [noise] we must and we should have been doing this five years ago and we we all are guilty [noise]\nUp not doing it and that is managing the wildlife responsibly [noise] and that means calling the gray seal population [noise] uh it is paramount and it's important that we do this [noise]\nAnd the Atlantic white shark conservancy\nAnd some of these other groups who are called upon for their expert opinion on sharks they in fact are part of the problem ladies and gentleman they are not part of the answer they don't want to do anything with those sharks they're into sharks they want to study sharks blah blah blah\n[noise] that's it [noise] [noise] and we all have to be grown up about this and realize that now I respect those of you [noise]\nYou feel that man humans when we go into the ocean are invading the sharks world [noise] I disagree with you [noise]\nUh\nBut there are people out there Cape Cod ... that's the way you feel [noise]\n[noise] okay I disagree with you and roll up your sleeves because you have a fight on your hands and I hope others will join me and I hope that I can help those out there that want to fight this problem we need to responsibly cold the seal heard so that we can have less of these dangerous animals great white sharks in and around our waters\nIt's that simple either we have the backbone to do it or we don't [noise] and let me tell you the moment that these environmental is like this had Lana white shark conservancy [noise] the moment that they think and they kind of sort of think now\nThey're trying to figure out their next move the moment that they think the Cape cod ers were galvanizing and we are going to move to get the feds to let us because you can't do it right now it's against the law to pull that she'll heard\nYou can bet the mortgage that these people they'll show their true colors [noise]\nAnd they're going to roll up their sleeves and they'll say anything they have to I Believe [noise]\nTo stop us from calling that Stewart [noise] [noise]\n[noise] so a little cocoon is Enron Bergstrom both expressed a similar point of view or that they acknowledge the seals are a problem we have to call the herd in order to deal with a sharp problem\nOr a video cocoon is ah was very emphatic he supports calling the seal heard via a hunting program\nRon Bergstrom Democrat acknowledges the seals are problem he disagrees with a hunting season though on the seals I couldn't get any more out of the map but I respect that Ron was candid and ... and [noise]\nYou know he is in an election in his base or is are Democrats and I I hate to make this partisan but I think that there are all awful lot of people who are of the Democratic persuasion are who are into this\nNot environmental thing extreme environmental as a [noise] a to actually run around believing that the sharks have\nMore rights than we human beings do we Cape Cod which do it's just a ludicrous way to think it's a it's an immature way to think\nI expected out of the surfers Cowabunga dude I expect it out of them because they've never grown up [noise] I expected out of people who served [noise] have you ever talked to one nice people\nBut not all of them but a lot of them they just aren't grown up\nAnd they're into the ... you know and we Cape Carter's have got to galvanize ourselves and we have to fight this and I don't think a lot of you realize just what a monumental task is in front of us because of the Atlantic white shark conservancy is of the world [noise]\nBelieve me [noise]\nThey'll do anything they have to do and they don't want a their precious little world of studying sharks and making a buck off of sharks by the way they don't want anything to happen\nTo that [noise] [noise] so it is what it is I suppose but are both Leo and Ron I thought were um [noise]\n[noise] we're very candid about that and I appreciate it and I'll continue to ah ask politicians that come before me in these debates are and I will be respectful I Know we have disagreement here and we can all hopefully remain friends or ask these different politicians black and white here\nKnow BS what your stance on calling those seals [noise] and we Cape Cod or in a very very bad spot I don't think you get a lot of you I don't think you understand the public safety issue or the economic problems that lie ahead [noise]\n\nI I truly believe that and no disrespect intended I you've got your heads stuck in a sand dune or something I don't know you are not getting a man being mauled and killed by one of these great white sharks it doesn't seem to have run a bell with a lot of you [noise]\n\n... thanks to Leo and run for the windows do we have and uh so we got more debates coming and we'll we'll deal with the shark a issue as well as a lot of other issues but the boss will county commissioners raises an important one it'll be up on the\nPodcast [noise] uh [noise] in a few hours you can go and listen to it [noise] the other issue of course that's ah been on everybody's plate a [noise]\nA lot is the confirmation process of ah Brett Kavanaugh a jet common off or was nominated and he has been a confirmed in a sworn in I think it all happened yesterday [noise]\nI don't know whether he's going to make a good judge or not he seems capable [noise] uh the drama aside for a moment ... ... my take away from this [noise]\nIs two fold one is once again [noise]\nWe are a very divided country the ours versus the D's coke versus Pepsi it's a ludicrous stuff uh the vote literally came down to one or two senators very divided [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd it [noise] I think is a\n... nother example of just how partisan and divided not just Washington DC but this country is the things I heard Democrats saying about this a\nJudge and his nomination ... were ridiculous the things I heard Republicans saying about it we're equally ridiculous you're both ridiculous I'm an independent um it was like I was watching a New England patriots football game\n[noise] [noise]\n... it's not a football game [noise]\nBut that's the way people are are are handling the issues of the day fish facing the country and the other take away I have from this is the November ... election\nI Believe and have fought for a long time a lot of political pundits have that there is a phenomenon that's going to hit us like a a ton of bricks it's called the blue wave Democrats have been angry [noise]\n... since the election of Donald

looking at things now and not just being\nWell they're still out though Josh demographic that it it is but you know what's going on but you know ... in our country we are innocent until proven guilty and there was nothing to prove that Kavanaugh was not\nOne thing and that was the issue ... and ... why do he only attack Democrat [noise]\nYou know oh by the way Democrats that are associated with sorrow ...\nYou know and and so this is that it you know you you got to understand that people are angry whether they're Democrats than not or Republican they are angry with what went on and that then it because you just pointed out as well as Susan Collins it [noise]\n[noise] we voted for the person that was qualified to be there he definitely qualified to be there his ... his his decision being used by the Supreme Court\nDecision that cited his decisions as sighted in some of the decision that there is no reason why he shouldn't be there but the issue is the Democrat from the time that Trump was going to nominate somebody\nSaid they were going to oppose them no matter who they were ...\nAnd that's what the people ... and\nThat was making people angrier and angrier [noise]\nAnd and and and I think you're going to see a big opposite thing because I think a lot of Democrats a fed up with the stupidity of the Democratic by ... ... you know they don't like what they did ... and\nAnd I think that there's going to be a big change in our election system whip up [noise]\nAnd I think we're going to the more independent running and and\nI Know are a lot of women are going to be but it's a liberal them with them you know think there should have free free free as I said to one guy that thought that I was well who's going to pay for it she says oh the ... and I says you think that ...

an independent because I'm just sick and tired of the Republicans when the Democrats but I don't know if that's going to happen I\nI I think that it it will it's just that it doesn't take a little time for that independent party is that working it's like the Tea Party people didn't think the Tea Party could do anything but they did and I think you're going to the the Tea Party rising up again

you're on W ...\nVery good good afternoon Patrick drive and talk to you know while I um I just had a comment on the debate if I could in Iran and and Leo [noise] um [noise]\nWhat gets me is the debate started out quite well you know I came in on it on the shark issue and then it quickly turned into Leo being accused of\nYou a couple of people are more on ... and in a in a building someplace and you know and if you don't know Leo and I know ... is a great guy but if you don't know if you if you want to vote for anybody and you don't vote for le ... only because of his response\nSay no I didn't call anybody Mara ... maybe ... maybe I did I don't remember but I could have and that's his honesty right there you know and you know I I I just wish they could be a debate and not fight ... because once people get defensive\n... issues kind of I don't really know everything goes out the window and then they know the ears stand up on the back of their neck I Wish they could stay at a debate\nThey think that's possible yes and no I think temperament and these things Carlos is important judge Kavanaugh for example got criticized and continues to get criticized that he shouldn't be on the high batch\nBecause of his temperament when he was responding to Dr Ford's allegations of sexual misconduct are and what have you\nUh temperament does matter and uh the part of the debate you heard between Ron birch criminally cocoon is quite purposely are letting these candidates at each other\nA and a Ron Bergstrom uh fired a shot at Leo about calling people uh up at the superior court house where the government is house a bunch of morals and uh you know it's\nAll the everything fell Leo is the fact that he said yeah I might have you know I I go to ... I Can't tell you for sure but a ... that's Jeff is on the like I said but I Wish we could get back to debate about issues could stay on that train on that track\nBecause you get so much more done if we don't have to defend ourselves to speak and as a politician that I'm not but you know what I mean once you get defensive\n... and I kind of an odd judge Kavanaugh I agree with the way he felt absolutely agree I mean he was being attacked as you know families being attacked everybody ... yeah I agree with the way he felt he should've every one of us would have felt that way too and if we said no not me you're lying ... you know\nI just thought I'd just say what I thought to debate a I'm voting for ... an honest man and he didn't ask me to call tell you that I have a good\nColumbus Day we read ... you know there aren't good man made through it\nAll right Carla thanks for the call my producer gene B Ozzy\n... you're telling me amount of time to get outta here\n[noise] All right I just love technology when it can have a positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a church two of the biggest causes of death worldwide\nNow imagine for a moment that you can get a warning that you are going to have a heart attack years before the event ever occurred\nThat's right well thanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans\nTell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by plaque\nWell that's the problem they say now that they can figure this out even before develops they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should start preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the came commando show time for them to cover their ears or you want to mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room\nAs long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready good there's a dark side of the technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use in\nHow do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is\nLegal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... brought on a huge soon so that people would be able to use its human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie west world okay Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visiting location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local\nAudience to specifically ban individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being [noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't parrot away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name for that how about\nA Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck [noise] yes [noise] okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on\nThe rise an average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies since the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so strikes say\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building\nA U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo or there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nOr a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the rail tracks\nBritish woman Louis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach walls so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see\nThat's it but if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a recent had shot for the funeral mhm and\nBe careful what you search for online we were talking about this before the show because I read the headline and it said ruby rose\nIt's the most dangerous celebrity to search for online\nAnd I had to

time two years but this past week ago started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys one's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd say like click seven for example\nYou can say go back

things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington\nEditor Nick how are you I'm good what's going on\n[noise] um I've been looking\nInto some money making apples um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are or you may be inviting trouble phone ... possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA living you know on a book extra months\nLiving here it's so it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that or a you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is the one that let you watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ... that will pay you one dollar\nPer survey you know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task Rio and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Cosco\nSo I took a picture and sent it off through the app and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk ...\nPie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise] uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nOr you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff and but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks\nTheir sweat calling for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coined that will be translated into like an apple gift card\nTheir surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website does that help

from Nineteen eighties Miami by yes okay oh and it was like so cool to have that phone and I remember like carrying around saying like oh by ten thousand you know [laughter]\nSo that they were like oh God she must be like a trust fund our she must be a Wall Street person looking there you're just so cool though yeah and that's why your shoulder pads oh my God I had to show that I had like the big hair going on\nWas hot [laughter] so I Want to picture you paint during the game now\nWhat was your first call uh my first phone was a Motorola flip phone where the battery was the exact same size as the phone I remember that was it was huge because that the razor\nNo it was the Motorola like cutie five seven for I think that was before it was before the race yeah and I ordered it off of an infomercial\nYou did yeah on television and it was like at two o'clock in the morning impartial\nAnd they're like you know the normal infomercials thing you've ever been lost in the woods and now you can get a phone it was like two hundred and sixty dollars getting saying well oh yeah I\nDon't I don't think this and people who have done infomercial [laughter] okay [laughter] not a a business as much as they are very cheesy but very effective I was sixteen oh you really sixteen\nI better and that what if I get lost in the way it can be you know me I got captured all the time yeah I Know you're really into that doesn't even work in the woods [laughter]\nAnd he was so heavy and it was like a hundred and eighty five dollars per month for the plan I Would not have written letters of London yes so my dad called them and said you know you sold this to a minor\nYou cannot have a contract with a minor and so they said as long have you sent the phone back they would cancel a contract okay I was only sixteen years old that's funny that was my first thought the actual first cell phone though\nWas available to passengers on a German train\nOnly first class passengers\nAnd it was all the way back in Nineteen twenty six\nReally I Would have never guess that the first ever phone was all the way back in Nineteen twenty six forty years later okay this is like a fun fact that you need to know for like oh yeah real pursuit or some game barn tribute doesn't exist anymore because of cell phones\nBut it ... or you can convince people to keep their phones in their pocket good when you could get a case of the first thing you could say when was what year was the first cell phone rang and it was available to first class passengers and German train route now Twenty years later Nineteen forty six in America\nWe had the first car phones that were available publicly oh I remember having a car phone so it's cool that was like there was like the nineties yeah in the forties Nineteen forty six they were using radio waves but since the ban with was so limited\nThey had got their first couple of customers and everything was filled up there was no more room for anyone to make phone that many customers and they have under a hundred I Know in Sweden at the same time their car foreign service was available and they have maxed out at a hundred and twenty five customers\nSee yeah that that's crazy I didn't realize that it went that far back I had no idea I would've guessed late seventies most yeah I would've said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out with their first ever put public cell phone oh that was a veil\nBull and they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds that's a big phone\nThat's a heavy phone
