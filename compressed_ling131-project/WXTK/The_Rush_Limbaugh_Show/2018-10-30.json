last month and they're down six percent yesterday which was not that bad a day right they yesterday and they were down another six percent so is the boom off the roads at Amazon well the issue here I don't know shares yeah I\nI don't either this is again as a company that we have a lot of respect for and totally admirers just this one that neither of us could really figure what ... really worth um and you know this is a classic example of a great business that's now into several great businesses\nThat just has gone to infinity\nAnd you know we can make the case that a small kept company could be worth infinity because you can make growth assumptions that are appropriate\nBut when you're dealing with a company that's worth you know seven hundred eight hundred billion dollars growing it twenty nine percent revenue right isn't that with their own it twenty nine may maybe twenty eight something like that and and training of the multiple in the triple digits\nThat seems like a disconnect so you know Amazon came to the end the problem is is when you buy me like that you're price to perfection and as long as things are absolutely perfect it works out the music stops one day when something imperfect happens\nUnless you're Tesla well they've had their bumps to they had to look at them you\nKnow this I even one must is a magician either cat\nGot nine and I mean it Tesla's stock straighten it three hundred and thirty five dollars they don't have growth like that I mean like you you don't get those two companies and their you know similar in age I very uh you know flamboyant and genius operators right I think you put Bezos and\nMosque in the same category in terms of genius right ah but you know Tesla shares bouncing back I I just don't know it it's still to be\nVery difficult for me to get my arms around Amazon and tried to put a value on ...\nAnd I'll tell you I I think ironically it's because they're making so much money that we can now treat them as a fairly mature business that can be valued and the most positive analyst I heard say maybe twenty twenty you can get fifty dollars of earnings\nIf you apply a thirty multiple that it gets you Fifteen hundred those are aggressive optimistic projections on a very large company to begin with\nSo now we realized gee you know this is going to be tough to justify\nIt didn't at fifty even though it's down yeah ... percent you still look at it at least I Do a jaded I and I say yeah I ... and you know part of the problem is I've always been a value guy right whether I'm buying real estate yup or whether I'm buying stocks and I can't get my arms around this and\nThat you know here's the thing being a value investor you and you let a lot of sex the ideas run and you don't get take advantage of them the good news is one of the music stops you start looking at these Israel businesses and an Amazon really has been treated is something that just is never going to go down\nI I Will say this in defense of the price for the first time in many years I can actually say you know what it might actually be pretty close to being what it's worth it and it's been way in the sky way it's been trip I look at that and said it's triple would I pay for it yeah now it's the point where it's like okay if everything goes rubble [laughter]\nIt's it's a justifiable price now I don't know [laughter] not not something I'd jump on whether it's at least it's not as ridiculous\nAs it was IBM down a couple of bucks say feeling about them I Know your own and I and I don't mean to put salt [laughter] I mean

of the attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue funerals for three of the victims are planned for today this afternoon President Trump will be in Pittsburgh ABC chief national correspondent met Gutman is already there\nIt needs to be addressed every effort that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere\nAnd yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs\nNow that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being done do up to that Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity\nAnd Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you're go vote it's again a classic expression or\nIllustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of Donald Trump\nBut that will get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night it's going to be\nA red wave rush I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats\nIncumbency has has incredible power reelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that\nMakes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five of flip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights as\nYou remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nAs your way around her mind great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic in critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter\nIntensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPeel a movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan crisis mailed bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy in anger\nAnd so they quote unquote took the high road and uh the stomach Trump trumps of phone I don't I don't want to be partners potentially split the scene and they're replaced by a ... and Trump supporters\nSo that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City\nBombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today [noise]\nOn George Maurice with this double ...

it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear\nNow even though the gunman at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh was a guy

West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nEasily any\nMilling around their first year olds had started in Pittsburgh after the ... got the cat this past Saturday President Trump and the first lady had did the city this afternoon ABC not threatening their\nForth but still despite all that I said I didn't get smart to make it an issue the west can sit out there in the ring its hands over oh my God Trump is just trying to rile up his base it's cold winning an election\nWe're ... we've gotten to a dangerous point here where ever left refuses to accept election outcomes and folks that cannot leave the anything good that has always been the glue that tells us together\nI I I I have at times I've marvel that this country has held together by the way it has for his many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establish is on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country and we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things\nThat have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm\nIn junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play\nThere were no losers there were no winners outcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down\nWe're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of selfish their self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election that is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened\nIf not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out I think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good and when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling the news civility and alleged tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I had turned it down if you need me to turn it back up I Will they went bonkers\nSo here comes a left wing billionaire Tom ...\nWho is one of his environmentalist wackos who hopes to make a killing him this this fraudulent hoax of man made climate change\nDire is running a Facebook ad campaign comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein the ad features a three minute long video that accuses the president of following dictator's playbook\nModeled by tyrants like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Kim Jong only in North Korea as well as Saddam Hussein they add describes Trump as a malignant narcissistic and claims he is perpetuating says yeah make\nMassage any video claims\nThat Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable to dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their time ripping the media because they are the media\nTrump isn't a dictator [noise] not even close to it\nLike only yesterday done at the drive buys her blasting Trump for tweeting that dire comes off as a craze stumbling woman [laughter] yet here he is\n\nWashington Post yesterday Trump mocks Democrat mega donor Tom's dire the target of a pipe bomb and stumbling lunatic and now here comes Tom's Diner bumbling along like a lunatic comparing Trump Trump to a bunch of tyrants\nJeff Flake said yesterday but it's on the white college Trump will change his rhetoric but elected officials should call him out\nAnd its supporters as being out of bounds you elected officials they'll continue to appear what the president at rallies where lock her up chants are encouraged in routine and phrases like the president is using I Can't imagine as an elected official attending a rally like\nThey were on the local leaders are saying that we must come together and stop the hey we must stop the violence we stopped\nAnd ... isn't that enter this was a great observation you are making this is classic you have one guy who's responsible for this he's mentally not write clearly off balance it does what he does\nAnd now all of you wouldn't fit for everybody we must come together we even as do everybody living marijuana has caused this guy to lose it and go do what he did the\nRabbi of that synagogue is saying some of the most intelligent stuff of anybody a particularly in the heated passionate moment but yet that you're you're exactly right at a local media during the

how to simplify their life [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nBack to the phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... ... it it it it's we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they deem sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed that were so restrictive the blacks that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognized former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he will be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he shouldn't\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly written\nCooking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that you know\nBut they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western\nCivilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort simulating we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal\nBut we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nDo that kind of work and help provide jobs and\nThe wait what what what what what what what are you what what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about we're talking about the same thing that we have in this country for a uh companies that would like to locate in inner cities are poor areas they get a tax break for doing that\nThat was part of the Trump tax cut pretty smart idea I thought why not do that in Central America they would be maybe the United nations could finally do something useful and subsidized companies who want to locate there and hire people to do that kind of work\nWhat you're talking about the caravan you'd think that what you do begin to stop illegal immigration\nI think it would have an effect on illegal immigration there are a lot of common sense things to do you know certainly the birthright citizenship thing going away it would help and the ... five but this is another thing that would certainly help providing jobs that they would be doing in this country possibly anyway low tech manufacturing that's being done now in China\nThat could certainly be done down there I haven't heard anybody talking about that that's what kind of I was kinda surprised that uh that nobody in the Trump Administration has been mentioned that\n'cause I don't think that's what this is about NAFTA was supposed to do that\nAnd it failed royally are these people in the caravan are not looking for jobs they're not looking for maybe ... maybe a few of them are but this whole thing is\nPolitical this is a political movement these people\nAre being paid somehow I'm In somebody's paying for all of this to happen\n\nUm there are plenty of places to be the only place they can go as the United states that can't stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries\nUh well I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and then we had a far greater distribution of capitalism be fine and dandy but the caravan and\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was on my door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate\nProblem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... [noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here because that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere\nYet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no\nSense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know has a George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a\nLike a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states are protected only Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in\nAs dependent voters a jam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\nHigh yes fresh uh two years I got my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him a couple of years and then they cannot fact option their parents go by the healing Gulf of Mexico\nThey had flipped over the border at least for high illegal a one party at the end of each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left on the ground and came back I had two more went back and got him a long shot is that\nEven today I had you know they were came to as thanking Trump ... horrible and that they let him he would send them all back home and and you know now they have Trump and they think this has got to stop and even because my father's been president twenty eight years I think\nA lot of flak Mexico not at a press that uh for\nThese people come here ... awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just said\nAnd they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nUnless that looked so they can't say we don't have hot ... the situation they now\nNeed help but you know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he was sent all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them or whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just\nIt's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe and so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back it\nWas you know [noise] ...\nHi I'm Tom Cox owner of ... dot com bust or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blinds we did what many homeowners do prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten\nLines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blinds I offer a fit or free guarantee meaning if you're blind so fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd now I've made it even easier check out our new tools cellular shades the first and only shades installed without screws or tools what can be easier for us listeners same up to fifty percent off any order just dinner the code Russia checkout\nLines ... dot com that's blinds T.

one way street is always you know what it's rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about everything one of the first

to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made

Moore wrong [noise]\nWhere do we get them\n[noise]\n\nWell let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent caller\nI lost her when she says how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act the media hated it it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples would then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they filed lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse\nTo bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence is the governor the media was outraged and they began to report\nOn this as no the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude know thing that they do\nWear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you make a pitch or when you when you make a pizza for why they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against the sole days zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo me the typical Indiana Mitt\nAnd she was just answering their questions naively and innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but\nPeople rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this starting in two thousand than the Democrats have lost over a\nThousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level and\nThere's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and er and accept it and it's this arrogance\nAnd this is the premise here superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nA the synagogue shooting ... obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition spent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't\nIt used to work like a charm and on many people still does\nWe still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them\nOr not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but\nThe electoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this in pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
