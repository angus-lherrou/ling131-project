lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're gonna investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened\nAll those years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think for\nMe I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I'm because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil\nVery quickly\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent Republicans who are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both verbally bubble if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should assemble the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard thirty\nSeven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce\nThe borders are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships\nFrom forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning meaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem I'm concerned that may be part of the excellent [noise]\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking um that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up and many germs are ... they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that\nAll of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump in twenty twenty or\nLet's go to the audio soundbites on those Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to the B. M. political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says oh we know the Democrats all ready man really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and found that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base in the ... I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent of informed because\nI\nI pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds\nAnd my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican doom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media\nRush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based\nAt a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out\nI predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nRetracted that production and said it could end up\nIn the opposite here\nBut of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make a case here is one more a bite on this this uh CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning\nJess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAndrew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get ... confirmed to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArgument like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think the whole situation that's really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi\nTo car crash on ... road and found that yesterday afternoon left three people injured the jaws of life are needed to extract to people from the wreckage\nThey were taken to found the hospital for evaluation and treatment\nBut voters are headed towards the special town meeting tonight with two articles regarding recreational marijuana businesses wanted the citizens petition to ban them and and now there is a barn planning by recommendation to establish zoning bylaws allowing them\nOnly people registered to vote in the town are expected to be allowed in on the Ninety five sports seen the red Sox and wait the winner of Wednesday's ale wild card game between the Yankees in the athletic who will come to Fenway friday to start the ALPA\nChecking the NBC ten Boston early warning weather forecast for Cape Cod today's ... clouds highs around Seventy overnight mostly cloudy with a chance of showers later on when I was in the mid sixties tomorrow cloudy and cooling off temperatures start in the mid sixties then turning cooler\nAnd he'd be let's have news radio Ninety five ...

what's happening\nI rushed thank you for taking my call you bet um I I've been curious about since the beginning of this year several times you mentioned that as an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the near term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is\nThat incident\nCould be I mean the but the point\nI was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we got a poll in June or appalling mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not when the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that on July\nAugust September\nA and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this\nOh dear this is going to get resolved\nOne way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats lose this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a\nThan what a democratic voters going to do it I guess going to be really enraged didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and sit home who knows what this thing is going to get rid of if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats won a year's delayed delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going to have a great impact on it this is

have been coming out of the woodwork claiming Hollywood this Hollywood that abuse me\nThis guy or mistreated me rape me wonder how 'bout the you're not a University of Virginia Rolling Stone story how

yet\nOn the tail end of the me too movement after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill and so forth\nChristie seaport goes in testifies in ... and I'm hearing from so many women who are saying well no my point is that I think anybody can say that but we don't know who's calling these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not\nDemocrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's\nNot something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness and sensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened\nBefore and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing I'm not saying women coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they are\nBelieve me [laughter] talk [laughter]\nGo go ask Harvey Weinstein go ask Matt Lauer and go talk to Les Moonves and ask them if they think that there's something relatively new here and it started happening because of Christine forward [noise] it isn't it's all part of\nThe plan to\nMake this particular incident\nRevolutionary new and so important because this brave courageous woman is causing other women to be brave in ways they've never felt like being before\nAnd I think that's not right I think the sensitization insensitivity the consciousness\nRaising has been going on since winds danger even before that but every time there's a public incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abused\nPart and parcel of it and I'm hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr Ford because she has given me the courage to ... the me too movement\nNot work on um the me too movement not give them courage\n\nJust think we're being played here folks\nUm [noise]\nAnd of course it gives flake covered for what he has done\nIt comes up to be a hero yeah we need more information we need more yeah what's wrong with more information\n[noise] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites these are from the oval office was during a\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminating NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by as were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we have one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin all things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls that are on very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was gonna win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about a misled I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like they you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me ... let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote for a vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are thanks to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr solve it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI\nSaying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking everybody these talk to that one of the Republicans do with that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or\nDo they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats are but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was rigged they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday\nIf we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip

fine it's busy but moving up the born rotary I'm David Gardner with your latest look at Cape Cod traffic\nHas been one of his campaign to get information to people why news radio Ninety five WICK\nHaving to\nUse radio Ninety five WMGK\nTo bring in a\nHad died last night I mean\nGet the point of Alabama wherever this record is old [noise]\n\n[noise] yeah yeah the brothers among the funk brothers of Motown backup banned it in [noise] in the bumper rotation here at the ... by being a mom so I just saw it just took a look at the Drudge Report during the break\nAt what am I see what is the lead a headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on the like here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly nicotine same fingers in New York Times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin on inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said I got to admit that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invested ... which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting\nAnd everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily and rice on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople\nThey want the FBI to talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all\nThis is is delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen there is an assumption operating out there\nNeeds to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nHas somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can\nDo with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start managing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh\nHas been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked more in this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it\nNeeded no such thing but he sure fell for the bait I Am not limited to thing I've told the FBI to take us wherever it takes them\nProperly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here are really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go
