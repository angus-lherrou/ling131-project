Bob welcome to the end of an outline oil\nYeah I'm fine thanks good afternoon I have a couple of roofing problems okay at at the house we have a ranch your house\nAnd uh in the back there's one of these turban ventilators gravity ventilator she on the bench the attic yup space and the other day I heard I kind of a bang on the roof and I went up to check it out in the fan one of the brackets supporting this stuff ventilator\nHad a broken and later had ... sort of punched in a self into the ... it into the opening ... it's a twelve inch fan\nAs as far as I can tell it's what the throat size just coming into the addict and I'm curious um how would I go about getting that replaced could I use a roofer or do I have to use an HVAC guy what what's the general procedure\nWouldn't be initiated the guy or a roof or should have a handle on that ... or or handy man that's you know\nWell rounded and\nThose that are doing a ... I mean it's ... it's been our dream now now now it's the gravity oh ... yeah\nYeah if there was one of the five miles an hour or something like that and it's pretty heavy too I I was I was kinda surprised I thought it was you know that kind of to any up there but\nThis this suckers got some some mask to it so yeah I Am concerned about the weight maybe doing more damage if it's leaning over are pulling on rafters or anything like that could could court with Cory Cory be a good person to start with\nA with him and see if yeah if they're not familiar with that particular products they may be it would be wise for you to do the legwork and find a replacement unit and yeah you know you could have them come out in ... but you know check with them and he may have a source and may have done that\nMaybe they could suggest something 'cause I I Would prefer to do like a French and stuff so I don't have to uh you know get between\n... and I'm just sitting there was yelling in ... it doesn't sound like something that would be their normal menu of items that they do on a regular basis without me and if and if it's not and he's he's he's game to install a for you but he's not quite sure okay that was it or is\nThis a related question the roof it's about ten years old and it has a it has rich France or rich that goes completely across the top of the house ... do I ... with a rich ... and and good uh movers on the side the sidewalks um\nAnd and some little those little mini van things in in the eighth or do do you even need\nTo spend a later they think well it sounds like you have a potluck a little bit of everything a little bit of everything um it it it's kinda that way yeah of course\nThe more more ventilation the better I Would\nThink like yes and no uh first off you're weak link is the soft advance it sounds like you've got these little animals oh things you know there's been a little tiny mini once you ... you need a ... I think it's a square inch of ventilation for every foot of rule of\nOf ... something of that nature there's a formula so it sounds like you need more ventilation in your suffered areas\nBecause that's where your eye bringing the fresh air in\nWrite all those other things you have a higher where the year is supposed to leave the addict\nSome got it really shouldn't need to Gable invents if you've got to if you've got a rich man and his working properly you shouldn't need to gain a land vents\nAnd you also should need the turbine if you've again if you've got a\nA regiment that that is is working properly but again for it to work properly couple of things have happened has to be the right kind of rich rent so that a big air moves freely through it and secondly you have to have make up the outcome in sufficiently down low which is why you need to upgrade\nYour suffered vents down low\nGot it now a car a hari roofing can do all of that for you\nThey can they can analyze your situation make the recommendations and then actually do the work\nThat that sounds like a good to have you need to upgrade to soften vents than they can do that um you know they could\nOne of the reasons you don't want to have the ... it's like um you notice on the Cape here they're putting more with rosaries in a traffic circles we have four way intersection as a as a cable events\nConfuse the Airflow up and your attic\nSo you want to block those Gable events so that you the Airflow flows from the bottom ... soft advance up to the peak and exercise that way if you've got a drought coming in through the cable ends it's disturbing that Airflow it's like having fall way traffic\nYou know and nobody knows who's going to go first you know you get to stay on it so get those cable that's close up and now you have that nice steady\nFlow and it's really a one way flow of traffic you get the air coming in a low and floating up underneath your roof and help the peak at Yale right\nOkay now the the other question I have this kind of a separate subject the roof has to levels that and there's a ... step down that a third of the way across the front of the house I guess that's the way a lot of these ranchers are built this this about a ... step down\nOr that runs from the from the bottom of the while we have to to the rich and the\nRecord in the air is kind of riding out a little bit you know and I'm now with a roofer normally do that or is that a ...\nA a roofer would probably do it in the process of changing your roof out but now that the roof is doesn't really need any roofing work that's really more of a copper and just job that okay you know kids 'cause you're represent want to come out just to do that kind of a of a project\nOkay typically brings you may find some rivers who will take it on but most\nMost will pass them yeah yeah okay\nIs that probably not worth the trouble very good this is very helpful I really appreciate it\nOh my pleasure Bob and I had a if you if you're having trouble getting through to anybody or during the week uh Laurie will give you the number of a Korean Korea the rivers yeah but they're going to be hearing person next week to longevity so if you can't get them catch up with them during the week um\nIs it is there anybody in particular I should talk to their\nUh well Armand is the is the person that you'll be talking to you you will be calling it what's\nHis name again Armand A.

I mean I don't know how many pictures you you have but usually let's say pictures like nine by twelve or you know even smaller distilled you should be able to roll that section in and have a pretty good idea if you\nPull the the nail whole out of the nail out of the hole and then you roll over you should\nBe able to put it right back yet okay the now the other way you can do it if you don't want to do that is you can take a paint brush\nAnd you can cut around all of your uh your picture in and use a little whiz roller\nThat's like a little four inch whiz roller yeah and then you can whiz role in between all the pick your hooks if let's say it's like we've seen stairways for instance that have a family photos Ron I'm In this you know this twenty thirty\nA pictures on it and we normally would just pull the hawk pull the whole roll it I'm not so much paint that it's going to fill the holes and but even then if you go over it several times those holes in it they'll they'll certainly\nShow up they'll show but we would rolling area and put the the er the nail right back in it but I right that sounds good yeah it's\nA ... you'll see it it won't it won't filament in I mean unless we've seen holes that if you did want to fill it in and you put the paint on heavier it will fill the whole and so um but for the most part those those holes that you just go all the little area stick to stick\nThe nail right back at how All right thanks if I can I think we are things that can lecture that thank\nYou bye\nBye but wait seven seven five nine nine eight five to match B and Chris Chris and Chris welcome to the end of an outline how are you\nTake a gentleman by taking my call sure what we do for you well I've got to interrupt your first time homebuyer I only\nLike four years and probably at twenty five year old I had an addition go back to it to be um like the bigger how are you ... your dishing probably like ten years ago maybe ... anyway uh started developing bleak\nAnd added one ... one of my family life and I went up on the roof and I use them black yell and I covered all the\nBlack but where area right above what we was hoping that would solve the problem while I get it um yeah I went up into the addict actually bound\nThat that would griffey from and\nWhat is it appears to when you build their roof you know you have your joys and stuff like that and then you put down plywood on top of that in our paper then you're single mhm and this will\nNot have a part of it just had my breath and it was like like twenty five year old planet\nSo and you can literally stick your finger between like push up on the ... paper mhm and I\nFound the one leak with like an old male that\nIs what\nIt all over that that that was pretty much tell our last spring and then all over my house in different areas in different world I started developing their not for that I had a bucket subject which are totally irrelevant from the first week that I Am so my\nQuestion is like and they're like oh\nI Would say yes no I I asked on your description\nAnd everything is all that they're all over the place and it sounds like there was a lot of missing of males and hitting between the boards and\nYeah and all of that and I don't know I'd never seen a route route like before\nYou know maybe you could cut a deal with flex seal and you could do a commercial flight ... yeah they send you over a truckload of flex fuel and you could seal up your roof and that guy out of the ... commercial TV ... following it would take you had a lot of flak [laughter]\nI bet you know what you're going to\nWait for them is that all of a sudden everywhere else in the respect that lake and if it's just going to continue to get worse than war\nMom yeah based based on your your description and and the evidence I Would I wouldn't count on you having you know you're going to be chasing leaks all over the place if you fix yeah once you find\nWell I Can't even remember the areas that are doing up in um in because there's so many of them like no other way I can do it got to be done on the outside like it should be\nSo you said that the house is twenty five years old\nI Want to say at least that I don't know a lot about it I Know it was an older like adage yeah and then they turned around I think in the early two thousand built it up to be like\nOh by the ranch type out yeah um and it seems like it's the new area that week in that even really really old so I don't know\nIt's just interesting that they're using boards a ceiling instead of plywood maybe you know the or they used to do that back a hundred two hundred years ago before\nI was around fifty yeah you know if you got to see in the seventies or ... with with the ... yeah\nAnd I couldn't even begun that could be the old part of the house and that if I have over ... after only out or you're like oh no no\nWe're going to go on to these Warren cheese like she's not in your new homeowners so that they offer these warranties and orange bunch of systems in the house including\nYou're at [laughter]\nAll that without a whole new um\nMm when they do and you have the roof done they're probably going to want to put new plywood over the planks\nIt could drag blanking there but if they put some type of plywood down then they'll have a smooth jak to work with right\nWell that's what I figured one going to be a can of worms there you have to replace everything\nAnd then they'll do like like rotted and you know perhaps even though I mean they they've been up there for a long time you know\nI'm John John don't you think if they're going to put new plywood over that a plane cheating that he's got there now than it might also a interrupt a rake boards on the ends depending on the ...\nThe Savage miss a way that sat oh sure yeah so they may have ... ... well I mean remember these topics plywood remind me three aids and then things are drip edge over yeah porch covered it that way okay Mm\nI think they'd have to ... point about ...\n... ... yeah if if you got that much decay and if there's molds and stuff on him to than you maybe you're better off ... uh but yet or deal with a reputable company um I Know new on her and you know knowledge to type but\nYou know don't don't use spend good money after bad work shared yeah to spend a few more dollars and\nYou might need to go back to the bank and say can I get a home equity loan that [laughter] and do you do is your mortgage with local bank or your\nNo no and you might you might even looking into a might even\nConsider a refinance situation saving do you live local bank but a a your mortgage lender is going to want to protect the integrity of the house so if you've got some issues it's going to be in their best interest to you know set you up with a ... refinance or second horn second mortgage or whatever so that you can\nYou can get out of there has to do it properly or at least in the pennies\nMac or get older you know their big name yeah\nAll right but I Wonder where any ballpark how much\nOf that when you are you on that day you've got too many variables because it has on what's there they may have put two layers on a in a small money or\nYou've got if you've got to take off the cheating because it's moldy or rotted there as long as there's no standard square foot price to work with here\nYeah even looking at it it's like it's almost like to suffer group you know what kind of like going a north south and the other one kind of going wet and they merge together\nOr it's critical how they joined together to that's usually a week area that for like\nA that that doesn't surprise me so that if they didn't flash it properly or if they had an existing roof and then they put a new one over the existing therefore they couldn't get into the flashing to do it properly\nSo yeah Larry we'll give you the name of the number of a good rule for that is a sponsor and a number of us that work with them and we've seen as well so you can you go to bed and I know in the ... right right\nSo it's a it's Korean Corey C. R. A. Y. Korean Corey the roofers five a weight\nSet of seven seven five eight to four zero zero and what they're going to be here next week so if you want to yeah if you want to call back next week and and get a straight from the horse's mouth yeah I haven't\nThat's like so many is on the other day who ... who\nIs why there's one or two sides were really hit and it it's very noticeable when you drive up the driveway and that's that he's dead weight positioned ankles so maybe maybe that combination that and\n... yeah you certainly try it the paint would go back to er nice look and then yeah that's correct yeah you wouldn't want the sprinkler hitting the paint surface either because the ... ... ... who agitate the paint and caused family yeah so one way or another you got to get them the water off it sounds like\nIt's taken it out because I'm not we're not the only one and I\nSee I see that problem quite often depending on where that the your property is and you you are well\nWater yeah it's wonderful to have that but you know what I wanted to say\nThat you have great commercials they are so helpful and I uh I I like your idea of what you said about ... you know\nHating it ... the best you can painting at one and then moving sprinkle like that but we'll have to do\nThem yeah yeah it's a good start yeah right well thanks for gas masks All right thanks for the call and good luck I Try to buy\nBuy but wait seven seven five nine nine eight five you know the other thing is you can move the sprinklers are changed to spray pattern on their heads but you know you get a wind can be blowing meltwater right spraying it up against the fence but then again it's not a direct blast\nYou're not getting the same amount of water in that regard but you do we go to move into the lion's share of the volume off of the fence or let's go to the phones were guts are generally and hold on them and we on beach to the punch in Plymouth hey we're on local to the end of an outline\nArgued that there are there I\nMay have in the ocean there was all a nephew minutes ago if I understood hair was trying to get a day in a plastic or something\nOr violent vinyl fences up okay\nIn the marine world that you and it's like ... even most hardware stores you can buy at Joe it's a sort of like Jell O ... o fiberglass stained river and it's been this stuff is more than anything that you would believe I have a sailboat and uh yeah\nIt's the stuff is amazing I mean I've got a twenty this and I can Seventy sailboat and if there's this thing they're\nTakes it right off or if I if I created\nTake it right out while I mean it it would be it so that if\nYou were trying to do along or you know a project you would do that way price would kill you\nBut it sounds like it's been in in Francesco situation it's a sprinkler has written a an option yeah hitting an area of friends so who knows how big that area is by that might be a war here it's a lot\nI mean just put it on a rag and wipe it because it's like jelly really spreads around\nYeah a bar or an amazing it's a very amazing product or fiberglass stain remover nice excellent well thanks for ... British it very well okay awesome or any every day but\nI've always seven seven five nine nine eight five or let's go to Dan in Orleans Dan welcome to the end of an outline\nOr you have to go back just listening to a conversation about anything of baking yeah I uh I just bought a six year old\nI'm with a virus on the front but I realized there are ... or ... ... ... ah I mentioned about anything in my own color and it was\nOh well you know ... ... is there any particular that I Need to know I'm ... I'm an\nOld okay so they told it's previously been painted and it's on your house and what color is it now yellow yellow and you want to change the color and they told you that if you put any paint on it avoids the warranty\nOr does it and you're walking down the house I don't think that's a huge deal I mean what's going to go with it and all but are there any particular fuel more readily their problem anything that stuff\nNo well hearty plank um [noise] was originally thought to be the savior a of ...\nSo they believe this is the greater yeah\nAnd uh they have found out that um\nYou know it um it does experience paint failure even the even the the board itself I'm ... will expand a at the joints um so you you can paint it I don't know why anyone told you you would avoid the warranty because they actually have extended warranties if to coach is applied\nVerse won ... uh\nAnd I I Would recommend if you did painted that you can use I'm just a one hundred percent acrylic paint\n'em you can use either a ... um\n[noise] but a hearty plank I Know when we would put it on a purchase it or what we would somebody else had put it up they would um the the warranties were based on the amount of coats that they got before they went up\n... ... so so um what's the preparation required on it you know\nHow should it be prepared a well it usually comes let like it's like a gray oratory no one could have finished painting but perhaps depending on how you get into a but ... ... it's just a light sand or or make sure the surfaces of kind of like ... and want to make sure it's\nIt's you can wash it you can wipe it you can write that down\nUm but uh you just want to make sure that it's clean and then you can talk about it so I guess I'd give the previously painted surface of white sand and then I Would talk with one of paint you want\nIn good condition or the or that you brought up real quick about those of the space thing pretty big gaps in it so I just do that with a flexible and people are\n[noise] um [noise]\nI don't know what's going non not silicon ... not painful but I Believe the manufacturer wants those large gaps I'm\nIn the ... ... they\nThey call for it in the instructions in the installation instruct owns a large gap in between the buttons I'm In the bud and should have been sealed before they went up\nUm but I you know they don't contract and expand so it it just the manufacturers are suggesting that application to put them up okay\nYeah I mean they should just you can't go back and we got to run but are they doing in the news but thanks for the call\nExcellent article by\nOur number two of a handyman hotline coming up after the news will get into the story of exploding toilets [noise]\nMhm yeah after the news to continue the enemy and

owners to death even kind of sickness and if any of that Clinton could read your air next to this buildup using on Feynman said no he\nYep good you are where you're at but anyway I\nNoticed a few days after I did it I looked around and go start noticed I saw a waters name like what the hell and so I looked around a little further and I found on the front of the house so I just hid it in\nAnd then I just uh whatever shingle it was on I recorded\nThat shingle and you know it disappeared mhm but I don't know why that happen I've never had that happen before ... so thanks so seat\nOf shingles um they are all the solid body ... seat of shingles our gift with a late texting I'm In less than a semi transparent stand you can get 'em out of Canada's a solid young how to solve the stain latex so by\nPutting more lay tax on it it will draw the canons out of the shingle um the the um the latex paint will actually pull the cannons through um so that's probably what you saw was a tan and bleed or on hand\nLate so not a water snake correct right yeah yeah\nThere was a tan and bleed if you use the ...\nMost cases you can uh just top cold again and he can and bleed area with the ... and it should be fine up in a yeah you don't necessarily have to use been on base because the Sherman Williams what gates is in in ... product which means that\nIs the first note that goes on ... it will encapsulate the uh the cedar blade\nAnd then when you taught as long as it's fully dried a you know not like the\nThe the wet dry where it's friday touch 'em if it's right for a full day than you can put in the second code on or ... or ... spot finish the areas that bled and I'm In a in a couple of fine um\nOh you said on and it could look like what it means to me right yup yup absolutely anybody else yeah absolutely yeah the ... he had an awful lot of saying\nOkay very\nGood how are you very much I may be a few more like you know what it is absolutely yeah 'cause I never run into that before\nI thought maybe the shingle is completely dry when they get them and you know a win anyway okay I was a a need for an explanation to the homeowner I Will tell them ... thanks a lot\nOf things for the call Doug You're welcome have a good day by by\nFive oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five and we did get an email through our website the handyman hotline dot com\n[noise] and it's from uh Maryland and Dick and their rights can Mr Stewart Mr Stewart\n... they don't mean that walking as an email me Mr Stewart asked [laughter]\nReally [laughter]\nMost places and may\nBe wrecked can can Mr Stewart recommend something to remove the top single layer of latex paint that covers and then ... painted decorative design on an old bureaus chest without damaging the enamel paint thanks for longtime loyal listeners as you know\nSo ... is there a stripper that can take off the wage tax and pain but without damaging the ...\nThat's a tricky question because you're going to have to agitate off the acrylic paint on top yeah and when you agitate that off you're going to scratch the surface below it\nWould be an animal of the enamel yes there's there's\nNo I mean Russia on wipe off stripper there is stripper that would stop after the latex before getting to a new there\nAre strippers um that will only remove\nLatex paints moving there is a um [noise] there is a peel away product or that they could try a test sample of uh that removes latex paint only mhm uh\nComes it it's almost goes on like a joint compound in a like a joint compound consistency okay and then you put it that comes with paper it's a special type of paper and then you put the paper over the peel away product and then when you pull the paperback\nIt will it should take the latex paint with it okay um I don't know how freshly painted the surface is but if it's if it's freshly painted they may be able to use um\n[noise] you know like a um a that might affect the I'm going to say they could use like a a a lack or something to take to to make that paint bubble up but it may in fact the uh the enamel on the\nBody goof off you know use coupons to clean up latex paint spills before you you could the problem is goof off\nUm it would have to sit flat on the surface in it you'd have to use a ton of it are you ... for it to activate and you'd have to use a lot of elbow grew\nAs long as those then here comes the vegetation again that would end up\nI mean you could use a ... a soft costs yeah in news goof off but I mean you can at all especially with the cracks and crevices yeah it it it that's probably not the way to go I mean we used to use goof off when when guys were getting into the you know they didn't know the difference between oil painting latex paint\nYou know that you can take some goof off on a rag in in life that and if it wipe it and if it came off on the rag you knew it was like a tax if he didn't come off in Iraq you know it was oil\nBut in this particular case I'd probably look for latex paint stripper only\nI'm then I'm sure there's other ones other than pillow away that pill away has several different\nProducts yeah um but there's other manufacturers out there that will have just the latex paint remover and then I Would try a very small sample maybe an inch square inch\nAnd see if it activates the paint off and does not affect the on the enamel underneath and I would use like a scar iPad you know those like\nVery soft green pads um do you read the ... yeah I've been very thin to agitate the latex off and in that will um reduce the chance of scratching ... the um the finish ...\nYeah 'cause I mean she describes its or they describe it as\nA the minimal painted decorative designed so to me decorative designed means nooks and crannies in corners and it's not just a flat surface\nYeah I mean it ... it could be you know like just so ... to ... um\nThat would be why you don't want to do it they don't want to disturb Breivik no what's under their right under the pain and wanted to bring it back but keep a preserve that's a that's a problem with us\nOut of the lead lead removal jobs at will will be on that\nYou know this stenciling nominates a lead you know the the the product the European on top is gone he's got less than you know you can't have both yeah you know you you can't take that off leaves but Levi on the old stance on an eight to ... so it's becomes an\nIssue I used to peel away brand\nProducts for oil paints what do you let it yes yeah um and that was very effective product so obviously it's a different formula to deal with the latex yeah life or comes off in a similar way that might not be a bad thing for them 'cause that paper that you put to\nThe mayonnaise peanut butter 'cause yeah let's see down\nAnd then with this Bill White paper and then after it sets for so much time you take the pill a paper often ... sticks to the polls are right off so you're not you don't have to ... and scrape the enamel surfers acts or latex mentioned should bond right to it yes so that will be the ...\nI Would think if it works as good as it were for the CIA\nMight be ... by I Know that it's like that they've done a number one\nTwo three oh depending on what you're trying to ...\nYou know up to work with us from time yeah Mm pheromone yeah it's a it's great stuff I mean um\nIt's funny the first time we ever use that product of leaves pale away numbers for Johnny on one Donnie ... ah relations ... area\nAnd we didn't realize at the time that we had a you know neutralize the wood after you do all you got to neutralize the woods so this ... twenty five years ago it was a page afterwards with a neutral I Know yeah so when we did the pale away on a on a window casing and then of course we painted it right and then the next day we came in and\nIn and out of print\nOf the window was on the floor\n[laughter] it's almost like a cast right at all then was on the floor of the window [laughter]\nWow so that's a much stronger stuff ... yeah I don't know where the paper that you want to remove but any other future pay I Want to\nGet on the left or neutralize it that's the ... idea neutral as they sell they sell in New ... always on the new job like ... you can you have to go yeah yeah we\nAlways use their neutralize or so you know because yeah yeah well what is used for neutralize a you know white vinegar or they get it\nWhile you're on your own kid very caustic I'm ... so you use the acidic and vinegar", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day":
