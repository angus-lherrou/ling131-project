get is\nThat many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but\nThe the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject why except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of this kid using it in a debate future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he bet that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did do it but you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and for out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all

I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of\nNative American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA

wasn't even any in the in her Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is the static and I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every day out there saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be embarking on what a stadium chore or yes bill and\nHillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not\nLike people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has that Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in

supplant take over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want that you may think rushed through enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance at why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring

independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of

they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't store yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the\nPhone it\n[noise] well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch wouldn't need to be back into close proximity the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an
