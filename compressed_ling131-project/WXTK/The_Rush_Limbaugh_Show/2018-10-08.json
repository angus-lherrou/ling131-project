[laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea of what\nWe don't know you ought to be your shoes are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh for the midterm elections\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this\nOn the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad insane crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and this Kavanaugh situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin off for it or ... he wants to see the F.

I Can't read what she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project their mental problems on to the public on the politics and it's exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration all to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain this\n[noise]\nNow folks to show you how to range and this is I have in the stack today I have um two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today\nAnd over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all\nBut they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for\nThe for the Democrats and much of it is I mean I\nJust saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this if it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and reacted them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left one of them\nIs a is John Harris\nAt Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are the wet rag party you know what this piece was about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because the ... the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats and Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of ...\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that

Friday\nAnd even if it makes me so I'm not you know I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is\nNot a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp\nOf approval of winning elections yesterday when them within their closely contained\nBases districts and states there on claims which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but at some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\n\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old several judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on an activist judges to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Juno before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd into Portland has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need activist\nJudges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point what\nThey believe in the idea\nIs they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years you buy my had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you renting it he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nRoutinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of Alexandria or gets difficult task who's lunacy on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it they don't have\nThe ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review\nThis every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon the into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the

[noise]\n\nContests\n[noise]\nPainting and surpassing all audience expectation every day Rush Limbaugh here behind the gold and the I\nJust got an email from a friend rush you are so right you're so right so often it's scary\nAnd you've convinced me that the leftist right\nRussia I have to confess my son Eddie came out of the war being all over everybody female Dr nurses even his own mother and sure enough my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy see\nWhat'd you say is true the white patriarchal power structure at work\nI Love the satirical reaction [noise] that's what the left is asking everybody [noise] to believe [noise]\nFolks I I'm I'm telling you these kids that have now become adults but maintain this\nAdolescent degree of range psychological disorders and what have you they have been taught this stuff and they really haven't been taught that the founding of America was one of the greatest injustices in the fall of humanity\nAnd the Emmy buddy other than white\nMen are victims and if you are a white woman happily\nIn a relationship with a white man then you're part of the sellout you're part of the problem you're letting everybody down you are subordinate in yourself to the patriarchy for the benefits that you get\nYou get a relationship you get an income you'll get a nice house you've got a family\nAnd so you are a sellout at I'm not exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\n[noise] go the audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span\nTwo on Saturday Saturday show called afterwards why does does she was running for attorney general ... is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is\nBut it's in the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez fame and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of this CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nWhen you read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products will power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact is is strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral\nThat's true in every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet shop and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind\nTo see the Democratic party had a line itself in such a way\nThat men were often don't meant that lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise] let's\nSee there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nA rush to begin to your show you or you had a rhetorical question about a dozen Democrats really believe in this new tactic with the mob\nAnd I mean the Democrats there and insurgency they become a political uncertainty and as you know when it's thirty he's already feed it they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued\nThat someone that was wanting to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot who has put some ... on the spider Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but\nThat's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats think they were going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning pungent commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that\nPeople are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle um\nSo I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot maintain this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago\nThe other side they had been shopping at the bit since election like two thousand sixteen and middle only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh\nFees miss work\n[noise] [noise] your brain

Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court heading to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats\nWere fit to be tied and from that day forward and George W. Bush was an illegitimate president and he didn't stop being illegitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's\nSix years later\nIn the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognize as the legitimate\nWinner of the presidency even though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that\nTime\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand to\nThe ... stone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a store\nPaul lyrical rally the purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up at the arena\nThey did this arena place it holds Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after ... Muslim died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from dominance on Trent Lott into boys\nAll showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorials honor their foreign one colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers and I'm a booming at them they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve and\nI remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went and\nI was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because the ...\nAnd it is completely under sold under appreciated by the Americans left and the drive by media Trump Scott for rallies alone this week and they are not national rallies they are intended for local consumption do not\nDiscount anything\nIn which Donald Trump is involved I'm just saying you know temperature start to change this time of year sleeping patterns due to its now getting colder at night in some parts of the country means one person might sweet more soundly\nWhile the other is freezing or too hot because the heater is on flannel sheets Super Bowl and branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets\nMay be the solution to this nighttime complication now when we had announced this last year they sold out on a hurry to flannel sheets\nBecause they only make unlimited quantity of the ... ball and branch they're unbelievably soft they're warm their readable everybody stays the right temp these flannel sheets they come and fourteen patterns in color is you're going to find a style online at our website that you love you can try them for thirty nights risk free\nThat's the bowler branch guarantee you sleep on them for thirty nights while you determine if they're ... soft if they do the trick of keeping everybody comfortable in the fall climate if you don't like um send them back all your money will be given back to you you won't send them back though nobody does very few\nWhatever you do don't wave because last year bowling branch flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks\nYou go to olive branch dot com V.

[laughter] ... well I play all that to say this that honest mistakes are made every day by Democrats everywhere wants a few degrees than temperature either way cut me some slack [laughter]\nJoined us much time as we once again save more rebel more junior\nLet me go back to the phones yeah I'm going to I'm going to weigh in on Susan Collins here in a in a second her speech on friday was it was I don't I don't think it was the turning point folks I don't think the votes any different\nThan it would have turned out if if the ball seaport hadn't shown up if I if I had the lakes all that ... that all of that not happen to vote would have been the same fifty forty eight\nFirmly believe that this is not to be critical of Susan Collins white the contrary the turning point was Trump explaining\nTo the nation that loves the Ford could not backup or corroborate her story that has not happened that did not happen in the hearings\n... got away with the incredible as far as the hearings were concerned only when when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she can't tell anybody where it happened when it happened\nWhat year it happened where the house was how she got home what she said after it happened to whoever none of it the people that she said were there all for the night at the American people didn't know that the drive by sitting reported Trump was the turning point\nChronic Trump\nEnabled Republican senators to hang up here is a Mac in Allentown, Pennsylvania as we head back to the phones greeting sir great to have you with us\nOh wonderful to hear from your Rausch I'm a I'm a listener from the earliest days and I'll make a comment about the Democrats the whole process because hearing and then if you have time I'll tell you how you converted my wife from my mom listener to one of your most loyal fans which is a crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearings which so\nSinister and ironic and all this is if you remember back\nTo Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days of my mouth out early but there are\nAll the accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live ah every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these women they lead father of books that made fun of the way\nThey lost their stories of the faith discredit them they questioned the motives on my doctor for where are you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have victims remember in particular leader Broderick the time the place to who what where when\nWith with um the army is so disgusting and there was no political motive with with Bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon use ah and I have to call it a weapon but for the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see Schumer I'm a turban and number of them won't even take a call from would need a proper a member of their own party\nYeah but they said they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy but the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault as evidenced by\nYour recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying\nIt was called a bimbo rupture in June and it was Hillary in that seat right\nBob Menendez Democrats senator ten void reelection Lee New Jersey was caught running around with one of those donors in the Dominican with underage women narrowly escaped conviction in a trial over campaign contributions Democrats don't care about this\nThis was just a vehicle was just it was a Hail Mary it was a total surprise\nUm you name it it was just the vehicle they tried it with Clarence Thomas Anita Hill like got close so they wanted to relive history and try this again um I don't think any of it ... was real when you look at the Democratic activists that\nWere involved with balls e forward I think the whole thing\nWas strategize now it's interesting you bring up the Clintons grab audio soundbites ten and eleven Saturday Michael Smerconish has a show on CNN his gas was James Carville and James Carville as the guy in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton years\nUh Paula Jones soon Clinton for for a number of things and that's where Clinton got in trouble by some morning perjury [noise]\nUh and lying under oath in a grand jury testimony lost his law license for a year ah it was James Carville said drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you're going to get\nOut here we are LBJ out your drag drag it out of there there are trying to park and that it\nWas it a hundred dollar bill or dollar bill a hundred dollar bill\nRight while they wait cargo still proud of the remark\n\nHere's the question what does it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed because then the base wouldn't be so mad so ticked off they all come out to vote in November\nThat that's the money question and I just found myself today for the Democrats Kavanaugh's is worth a lot more alive and dead this is not going to go away they're not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh they can you know they're going to keep the front and center he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just pick some was equally is right wing his cabinet on around them through in in a lame duck session I think today's resolve is probably as good as you could hope off Kavanaugh is going to be an issue in two thousand Eighteen is going to be an
