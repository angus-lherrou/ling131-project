[laughter]\nOh yeah oh Mike I'm telling you I'm counting on it and I'm I'm not threatening but I mean if the Democrats get back in power I gotta tell ya I had my stage\nUh uh I'm not going to stay on the radio I'm going to lose total a it takes too much out of me and others and see this is the other thing that the public\nThe the the uh war see\nDemocrats were see women and this is a minority now because I have so many women come up to me I Am I'm not I'm Serious and and tell me that they love Trump they don't like what he says all the time but they're going to vote and the ... press will not\nTell you the truth about that but what I what I was driving at is this was seen is is that you've got to make a stand somewhere\nAnd you've got to recognize the dangerous situation we're in now with propaganda is what the what the majority of my news is now it's propaganda\nYeah Jeremy Hammond yeah good men that are right hey thanks so much you\nHave a good ... if I don't talk to us to have a good well coming into November let's go to Glen on the cell phone I Glenn\nHow you doing excellent um\nI did you see this Trump a summit with young Afro American conservative leaders know oh they just at that and Fox News added on on and I thought of you because\nAll these young people very very impressive they all the Democrat and they all said that as soon as they left the Democratic party they felt a sense of liberation\n[laughter] isn't that wonderful Leno huh\nOh my God and the wonderful part Don Was\nWere real American they understood why this country is what it is or has been and they want it they want to fight for it they want out of it and anyhow I just thought that sounds like bon\nOh these people saying they up now wonderful once they left\nOh I'm telling you or Glenda but again this is a great call too because\nAgain having been a teacher and the employer and I I\nI have had a closeness I'm new in music in Boston with the black community I have great friends and I have and there's never any thought about a racial situation it's all created by the media and what bothers me is\nThe media and why I say it's propaganda is I Believe you are pointing in that that particular meeting with Trump there are so many black\nOr people now and I say it I guess that's offensive to the victims out there are but either black or you're not you know I happen to be white 'cause that's how God created me I ... it isn't like it's supposed to be a dirty word one but the big thing is\nThat they're stupid I mean ... and and it comes up every now and then is that the black community\nOr their rides those that are outraged to be taken for granted that uh because they're black they're going to be Democrats\nNo and that's just not so my God they get an education you see them in great positions you see the great acting jobs they do on television and the movies they are people then not black people\nAnd the only one that makes some black people or the press the people who want to always it's the same like I mentioned with the Frank that call about police departments [noise] nobody talks about how many police now male and female black\nBut they're not black their police officers for God's sake and they were out there jeopardizing their lives like everyone else\nRight anyhow I thought you know I appreciate that and I did and then he goes on other yeah go ahead go up\nQuite a few of these young people that were with Trump actually came from very humble and or beginning you know what I mean there were plenty of yeah there were plenty of American stories there it\nJust was then you know all the ... oh well do black leaders there was a lot of it that are ah well on themselves up by the bootstraps which is a very American thing\nYup well again thanks Glenn very much I have a good why yeah keep listening I'm and I wanted to just mention one of the saddest things about Bill Cosby who turned out of course to be an absolute you know that's evil stuff [noise]\nBut he was a great influence early on when he was popular and he talked about the responsibility of men in the black community to take on the responsibility of families and all of the children and that the kids\nNeeded a father figure and it was one of the rare ones then versus Jesse Jackson's some of the others who love to climb on the victimization but that's not the black community\nThere they're not only super intelligent and super of athletes musicians whatever\nBut many resent and it's time that that are again the media is not going to cover it but it's time that more people were on a of the black community that say it\nBothers me the the uh all these uh black shows and everything you never just like a a PBS and and a public radio they don't have people like me on\nThey never have a conservative represent and and are these black news things you don't see a black person that's a conservative the talks about the other side\nAgain it's all planned propaganda by the left and it's very dangerous for our young people alright let's go to Tom and Bruce to Hi Tom\nHi Don um she's a million things I'd love to talk to you about right I'm\nAbsolutely agree with you as far as the media it's shocking I Can't even understand an interesting comment you made was that your set that you've got George Soros was ah was financially behind the control of the media\nWere they were held accountable by the country that they were being allowed to come into\nNot anymore not anymore it's not kind\nHow we haven't come a newly illegally and all the handwriting is worried about the kids they don't even care about checking whether the kids or this or not\nBut that's the way liberalism is oh wait a minute ... are we going to a break oh John you hold on I'll get back to you as soon as we come back as the ... stay with us\nNow man come in these\nThese radio [noise] Ninety five WICK\n[noise] some people still\nThink an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is I\nWent back ladies and gentlemen let's go to John thanks for holding John are you in Boston\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia in helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's still family care dot com ... three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health and\nWell I'm from oh that's okay good yeah go ahead\n[noise] forever\nAlong the water I think I'm pretty open minded it's something that\nI recalled out because it's part of the current problem with the political situation in country got fired for being on them\nAnd just made a comment about Hillary Clinton a whining about your like your election Donald Trump was the one complaining about the electric cars and how it was\nThe only and it didn't make any sense but most of your own you're treating it well\nI Am going wait a minute I'll stand corrected I was not aware he said that I don't care who is against the electoral college they're wrong\nWithout the electoral college I Believe this country govern mentally will be over because then the big states heavily populated states will control elections that's all I was saying so I don't mean\nTo pick her out over Trump I was not aware\nThat he said that and I applaud I ah I'm appalled that he would do that so\nIf I think he thought there was it was going to get more votes than when you're like you know cause\nIt was going to carry the California and but you know yeah it was going to carry had great and it was going to carry for the other one is going to get elected I think you're right it founding fathers what they were talking about\nWhat they made it a representative and stuff where\nYou can't just campaigning ten states than when they why because you do\nWell John just so you know how long you've listened but\nI Know I was a Democrat most ... I Know I've always voted for a candidate that I preferred over another one you know I was a Reagan Democrat but\nI'm just saying that I don't mind being criticized but I I did I Would never have a double standard that's what I don't like uh I uh if ... if Trump said that he was just as wrong if you remember John the one thing that is always\nStuck in my craw to was it was ... when they went through that Florida fiasco\nAnd and uh the electoral college and all that the conversation ... all the Al Gore had to do here is father had been a senator for like twenty plus years he was a center a Tennessee all he had to do is win his own state and they didn't you know\nAnd I mean they made a big deal it if that had been a George W. Bush at last Texas the press would have said hey Mr Bush why don't you just keep quiet you couldn't even when you're home state go home and keep quiet\nBut it was a Democrat and so they made a big issue out of something that I think\nYeah I mean they had every right to ... to question but those were democratic areas where the so called inaccuracies were those were democratic uh areas you know\nEven if the election years ago nobody listens to her husband and goes up all the great lakes region or maybe some campaigning in Syria where to go because obviously they were going to go well maybe she doesn't lose you know yeah well again you know got nobody to blame but\nKnow that that that's right hey listen thanks very much and I'm Glad you said that I I\nUh I don't want to be a I'm not one side is just like this discussion about\nA John Kennedy I I'm not a oblivious to flaws in his character perhaps or whatever was going on it's a absolutely anyone that thinks the behavior of the president of the White House with women whether it's Clinton or any of them\nAre is again their head is up and and there's you know aware because the reason that a behavior by a president is all encompassing and his personal behavior and his personal life is no longer that\nBecause if our enemies get pictures of compromising positions by a president who's running for reelection\nThen we I held hostage by a foreign power who could well a ... society\nIs it this crap hole and of course it was the double standard when it was Clinton it was his personal life wonders ... when it was George Bush I mean when it was a Donald Trump for crying out loud they're going after his sex life eight years before even thought of running for\nPresident okay enough [noise]\nListen to this beautiful song [noise]\nWe're in a beautiful country the best the river bend with great people both sides I don't care what the political position is I'm proud of America [noise]\nI'm proud to be an American I'm proud to be on Cape Cod [noise] I Love my listeners hope will be around a while longer [noise] but you have a wonderful weekend even though it's crummy [noise]\nGod Bless you sudden became showing Ninety five point one\nCompany which is\nWe are asking me on local news authority WICK west you're much Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nOh here's the latest\nFrom ABC News I'm On a real thing on terror in Pittsburgh from an active shooter at a synagogue in the squirrel hill neighborhood police spokesman Chris ...\nAnd uh I'll be honest with you I rather be here and then on the roof\nI'm sure that you're with and and your workers are probably glad to have a day off yeah because they're not seeing me today because you guys are tend to work a seven days a week sometimes living\nYeah especially this time of the year it'd be you know we have to work basically every day as long as it doesn't rain or snow or something you want to\nGet it to work in before the bad weather it's absolutely yeah\nYeah because we lose a lot of days no matter what sure so you know we need to make up for those days that were lost and you know [noise] uh that's the reason this time was a year and we have to work\nBecause the guys are looking at the ... the holidays come in and we'll have Thanksgiving off and you know the family likes to eat so it's going to take a pay check just to feed him from the day [laughter] well that motivates them pretty well I Would say now we got Christmas around the corner\nWhich reminds me to to remind everybody we Christmas has eight weeks away so if you haven't dealt with a chimney\nAnd you expect senator brings in just the sheer [laughter] you might want to get on the ball because I don't think you know Santa ... kinda pays attention to some of those safety as he might just laying on the roof insight on not touching that chimney [laughter]\nYou weren't a good boy or girl does your own boss if I'd go try again next year so [noise]\nSo yeah BP mindful you you'll be one of the late that fireplace soon if you haven't already and um you know if it's not functioning right\nYou might want to console was Steve as to how come I always seem to get smoked down inside my house all the time when it's supposed to be a nice romantic fireplace and were will coughing a gag and [laughter]\n... billowing out of the ... I was a face you know you're the fire locally not be constructed properly you may have some issues and\nObviously a Steve Katie and his his crew they will build fireplaces from the ground up so they're aware of of the proper construction techniques and the type of dampers and how they work\nAnd there's what's called a smoke shelf when to build a fireplace that kinda keeps the smoke from working his way back down again it's so Lewis ... who smoked ... yup so they all all those ... if you've got\nAll I Am and just saying oh I can make a fireplace throw a bunch of bricks together in Illinois opening in a house and on opening up at the roofs of the smoke and get out I got to cover it shouldn't be construction it's not that simple as a whole art and science to is it or not and the coach change all the time is actually\nThere are building coast guard and what goes on it's just sort of give a quick shout out to Charlie Corey he was going to join us today he's under the weather unfortunately he is responsible for our men and I'd be in a part of the program of course like Charlie I Know you're listening\nI was I was hoping to have ... with us so that would have been a nice treat sub SUV was was that they want to tell our listeners about the Charlie coming until he's actually here so [laughter] we'll get 'em at again another time and he has the gift of gab no grudge that he does but we've uh speaking\nOf gift of gab we have Justin Centerville who wants to a chat about something with this Jeff welcome to the handyman ...\nIt's a good day but let's get beyond that\nI have a thin layer and several fresh when they start she was a\nTech a scallop when it's under a shakes on the side and some of them are great and some of them are not very\nAnd we don't want him coming into the how do I know they're really\nOkay uh the first thing I Would pay attention to is um [noise] uh if the shingles are curling\nAnd if you see that the shingles or curling if you see that the shingles look wavy they don't ... roof and uh that's one of the signs that it's almost time to address the roof\nAnd the second thing would be that if you were around when they installed the\nOriginal roof you should be able to determine haul 'em all the shingles that the installed wood warranties for is it twenty five year old a twenty five years shingle as a Thirty Years' shingle so based on that you will be able to tell\nIf it's time to to replace the roof or not and uh you should definitely not wait to get a water damage inside the house\nAnd um you see a if you'll where to spend a little tiny addict you might be able to see if there aren't any leaks in the addict because before appearing inside the house the leaks will force the periodic space\nAnd it will take away a bit more time for you to sit in the water insight on a ... truck so the first thing I Would do I would get to the addict with the light and they try to take you know pay attention either a new stains off water if there is any then eats that's your son right there that it's time to address the root of\nAll\nI think you answered my question thank you very much guy and I said you're right it is raining cats and dogs [laughter]\nAll right Jeff thanks for the call that gives you buy it in terms of the roof shingles like you're saying if if they are copying the kind of curling what causes that as as a he'd build up in the attic if it's\nNot that that can be one of the reasons it can be that uh you have ... you don't have a proper ventilation any addict and you used to be addressed the roof and the ventilation that can be one of the reasons the other reasons is the ... the ... over time\nAnd because of the heat and cold weather distorted curling gets queasy and they look ... on India look old so that's the other sign that you kind of need to address the but the ventilation can be part of it and it can basically make the process faster\nThe process of shingles getting older faster so that will contribute to shingles getting more to read it\nBut either way when you see the district shingles are competing in curling and their start in sticking up and just start losing shingles\nThat's that's the sign that the roof needs to be addressed\nMakes sense because now you see the to the deterioration age when he's writing\nAnd when they start curling up basically when it gets easier gripped the shingle when it's windy and I just rape trade off you know\nAnd at that point in their life they're probably starting to get dry and brutal ... says they break that much\nEasier absolutely and I mean you you can just I mean I don't know maybe it's me being in a in a business where a wild that I can tell just looking at the roof it needs to be addressed or not\nBut I mean I think even to bear I Do for a person who you know who was not in a business just looking around the house is looking at your neighbor's house your host view other houses you might be able to tell if your shingle need to be addressed\nThat there's a certain psychological then called denial you know and people look up to the roof and it's an eye on like my roof can't be ready kept failing yet\nYou know [laughter] as water's coming up yeah [laughter] well we can still coalescing we will psychologically prepared for it so uh you know\nEither way I mean you know you cannot hide from the ... right I mean you know your weather address it sooner so you don't get more damage more problems later on so you know he might be just smarter to address it right away and at one of the reasons for it is it's just very simple\nEvery sinking price keeps going up year to year even that's slightly increasing the price I mean you will save that money if you're investing to your property this year instead of next year\nSo that's that might be another way to look at the issue that you might save more money down the road if you addressed it now\nRight prices are increasing as a a a larger percentage than all the savings rates livings accounts oh sure yeah\nAnd the the the thing is I mean you know like I mentioned this previously none of us really wants to spend money on anything no I mean you know you would think I mean you know we'll see we'll hold on tweet that's as much as we can but the reality are you\nUp spending more money you know you can go then you're going to address the damage you've been address to ... you know and if you have any damage anything has been damaged and said that you can spend more money you might as well address it you know in the beginning instead of waiting for a while\nExactly exactly and then there's some people sometimes they're afraid of 'em\nYou know that uh if you're a salesman and you're you're given a sales pitch and um but look around look at the other houses in in your neighborhood that are similar age you see some new roofs calling up chances are it's because they they're so worn out and and they've had to replace those and you know you're in the same ballpark so\nYeah and you need to do something about your house you know when he was built when the roof was replaced and what kinds of shingles do you have you on the roof at the moment\nBecause I mean there's the information you can always pretty available winning Internet and stuff and you can determine you know the shingles that you have on the roof ... what are they waited for there are there twenty five years shingles Thirty Years' shingles\nSo based on that you might be able to determine if and then the other way you just to you know call professional they they'll you know get a couple of opinions and I just want and need everybody's opinion matches that means I mean you know you you should address it\nExactly I mean there's there's a lot of work out there so it's not like you need to strong on somebody to to ah to replace the roof you've got plenty or customs waiting to have their roofs done\nI have plenty of customers wading into going to be unfortunately waiting for a while before I get there to see it is very busy and I tell people and you know we don't need to lie to people and you know we're not sitting on the couch waiting for that one job\nAs they build achievement\nSo I mean you know I don't think you know uh I mean\nYou know there are rumors they'll do nice job with the flashing but they don't think they'll do as good a job like the ... the ... with the because that's their profession so I mean you know that's that's when we decide but I think we get more phone calls regarding the cumulative than than masons\nThat makes sense people think roof is a whole yes I'll do that it's coming somewhere from rural [laughter] even if it's touching the chimney it's\nA little baby oil is coming from up above that means I mean it's the roof so I think the basic but be you still I mean you know you put them on the right direction and they called him a son and you know masons will address it\nSo Steve are you an agreement with his claim the roof of the later [laughter] blaming the river that might be glad to come home is decided but it's probably the roof [laughter] yeah [laughter] I'm ready to go up there in diagnosis foreman\nYeah we'll we'll do that a lot I mean they will do what you see the thing is sometimes\nThey won't even tell you where it's coming from they wouldn't tell that it's the it's the chimney they would just get a phone call do you guys fix fix ... I mean you know do repairs and stuff we say yes we do and then when you go there and you look at the gym you just you know you think to yourself well I just wasted an hour and it's not even the roof so\nYou know that's usually you know that always progresses and you know whether you're still give them the right direction who told them listen it's ... it's comes from the flashing or from the Jimmy itself\nOr just ... and the simple thing I mean the easiest thing will be to terminate\nJust go to the addict to take a flashlight just go to the addict can look at the chimney go with a flashlight around the chimney and look at the gym need self the breaks you will see the Spain's underwater staying where we usually in white collar and you'll see that there's you you look at the plywood\nRight next to the chimney which is you will still see than all the appliances deteriorating that's the sign that eats the East that she needs to of course if you have a big roof and everywhere else but the the plywood this dry and it's only around that she need that eats you know deteriorated it's old and it looks bad\nThat's just a sign right there that you need to call the Mason because he did she need self it's a completely different profession has nothing to do with roofing but you know you can you can\nFix it touches the roof and took it has to get married to the roof he said has the yeah the flashing yeah\nWell we we we actually get the same kind of phone calls with the with the bathroom pipes distinct pipes OSHA yeah in ... we've had instances when the pipe itself has a bad connection and the water goes inside the pipe drips ... in the addict and people would think it's the it's the roof\nI mean you would go there and the roof looks fine\nThe roof has been installed by somebody like the last couple of years [noise] ah but I mean you know each each group and you can see where the water is dripping from sure he's just coming from the pipe and you know 'cause like I said people most of the time when they just see a water they just automatically someplace called double first I had a case\nWhen are we actually did the roof\nAnd the homeowner called us and he's telling me well you guys who stole the roof two years ago and I'm having a major league inside the house in the closet\nAnd I'm like well this is a surprise to years nothing and all of a sudden he has a major league so I go to his house I climb up on the roof and what I see like a huge area of the roof is gone\nThe ... just poured to hold on a park and all he needed to do just stand in the back and look at the ring section and you would have seen it I mean there's a huge area of the shingle but like a pipeline just rip do everything has gone any area but like I said people usually don't take that time too you know to do some investigation to see where the water's coming from\nThey just automatically assume that it's a roofing issue and I mean all you need to do all they need to do sometimes just look up\nOn this case it was real familiar with all your was a ... ...\n... and it has happened actually one of the reasons why he replaces the roof he he had I mean one of the reason was it was all it was almost time to replace it then the second one the ... has done had done a lot of damage on a ... a previously before we did so at the same ... back I think\nYeah [laughter] I I I I have one of those in my house [laughter] it's our whole to the side wall was actually living in the house when I bought it I had to have victim yeah he probably brought his relatives that trying to get [laughter] well getting back [laughter] revenge as a sizable I've had the patch it [laughter] I have a\nPatch which led than I I haven't done a permanent society kinda yeah ... every so often I wander on the back and look up a K still good you're told him say\n... like I said I mean you know he he's just easy you go to the addict in on a rainy day and if it's a wrong did she mean stuff you just look up look around the chimney and you will see some water coming in and he's just the Siamese anywhere else in a roof\nPlywood there's dry if these wet the wrong did she mean there's just a sign that they see me as a problem it's not the roof and ...\nYou can actually if you take your weight while you're up there if you shut the laid off got you flush toilets shut the light down and take a look around the chimney and if you see daylight around that chimney [laughter] you've you've got an open source for water to give 'em down through so that that's the other ... that's the old masons trick\nI have a client that has a a house with a center channeling mhm\nAnd um I was doing some money to paint inside of the closet was water stems from\nKennedy so I go in there and I'm going to prep the walls and I noticed is literally erosion grooves in the plaster\nFrom the water heavy trips so it's obviously chronic has been doing it for a while yet enough so so that the water running on the wall has created all erosion grooves in the plaster and it's just [laughter]\nI think we definitely have an issue here with the chicken\nAnd the you know some of the people even the you know that's that's what they do indeed jumping into conclusions I had a guy not long ago maybe a week ten days ago he called me and he's like well I'm I have a leak and I think I Need a new roof\nSo I go there through if it doesn't look old it's an fine shape he has a leak or on the chimney and the chimney flashing gets dumped terribly and I told them listen I don't think you need a new roof\nYou know your roof is in a fine shape and you know you all you need to do is just your ... and the problem with that case was he had to basically rebuilt is cheap because it has a a pet or Chatham pan flashing on a chimney\nAnd to you and ask just the will tell you you cannot really repair those changes you can only rebuild those chimneys I mean you know because the platinum gets his installed as you build the team native\nSoon I pulled the guy get a may some I gave him Steve's number even and you know I told them it needs to be addressed make sure they do it that's ...\nAnd they showed him his neighbor's house and they told him that how your foot chimneys needs to look after the Mason is done and you know that that's it because of because like I said there is no reason to you know because of ... that she needs to be built\nRebuilt again they called referred to replace the entire roof they spend a lot of money the problem is still there or they leave the chimney behind the chimney still there and you will flashing still there no matter what you do you know he's going to lead\nExactly and I tell you cite attend that old Jimmy a step flashed which is the most in very a way to ever flush of Germany from original construction\nChatham pan flashes a leak proof system so explain to us a lot of ... is a big sheet of lead that literally goes right through the roof we take the chimney down and we have these big diamond sauce and we five and a half inches up around the roof we cut all the angles we lay out the sheet of lead to\nReconstruct the chimney from that point leaving whispers in the very front on the bottom costs for water to disperse or a can testify to that\nYes I can I ask them this morning and I never noticed that [laughter] and I never noticed the holes in Germany yeah he's like yeah they were gone for like a month or whatever they came back and they like you know you have three ... and I'm like what and I looked up and I'm like\nOh I got to ask Steve this [laughter] still don't\nWant to disperse from the chimney so would it goes through the freeze thaw cycles and have a choice that are put some pots and pans and you're from fire ... down there I well we could go with silicone like I'm In so\nYeah [laughter] no that's fine the way it is fine [laughter]\nSo the the ... I guess the\nThe idea of the chatter of half lashing as you've got that barrier exactly because ... is porous it'll suck up the water like a sponge or if you get a crack in the crown something you get that extra\nUnderwear if you will was captured by that paying you know just versus a job that pan away the trinity internal workings of that Germany always stays strike alright so then at the low point you leave a couple of ... so many water collecting right on nine to right across the insurance on the very first cos ya instead of just piling freezing and causing headaches and that's\nThe only way to go and it's a leak proof system like that stress that enough and so when you when you strip or or or her chimney down now you've got the bricks kind of like in a step fashion\nWell now or no one was retaken run a dime and saw all the way down we come off the roof at five and a half inches to break the basic breaks leg to courses are about five and a half inches okay\nTake cut all your ankles then you lay the sheet a lead menu custom make it fit informant make them in jail lay all the angles in every was cut each brick individually on the ankle\nAnd run that up until you square off that and point and then you reconstruct a nice details crunch from that point oh so you don't you don't do a Ninety degree cut you do it and angle ankle side of the four letter conform to each I started having a step that you were talking about are actually creating a nice straight wind going down along side of that\nAround you bring it to a point where you're squared off All right and then as a flat surface this eventually it captures all the water and disperse is okay\nAnd I'm a you know in the the chemicals that they use or not or a plant friendly then you should be all set but still even with that I Would hope to a person and do some research about the product because we do not handle any kind of for Washington I'm not aware of the product that you're talking about\nSomething like this is John I've had a little bit familiar I already with some of these products I Believe the wet and forget is a it might be a hydrogen peroxide based\nUh those type of er of cleaners they do the job but they worked slowly um that's I think where the name comes from wedded forget it you put it on and just forget about it I ... I Will work overtime or versus some of the clean as like a Joe ... with the bleaching them\nYou get more of an instant um result it resists results but again if you've got ending like light can or or some growth up there with the\nThe Joe ... with the bleach will do all probably the wet and forget may have the same thing it kills off the growth but the growth will stay there for a while until it dies in the wind and rain kinda you know wash it away so you don't see instantaneous results with this stuff\nI was just concerned about the uh uh damage that could be done to the ...\nYou won't do any damage to the shingles with using the product or what what damages that if you use a high pressure wash their you know Paul wash or you try to ... off\nA scrape it off so you you you put the chemical sign it which is when forget as a chemical base or I'm calling I'm chemical ... is cleaning agent but the cleaning agents his friendly to the roof but it kills off the uh a mold and mildew growth and\nWhat's the name of that other properties say Joe ... Joe ... Joe ...\nAnd ... the ... on the back of the label you mix it with water and bleach tells you how much okay you can do that yourself or you can have it done commercially one of our sponsors of Stuart painting does do or how refreshing and house washing and they use the Joe ... product\nHigher ups like on the other thing is but\nA chimney guy I'm just yeah they have a product called Jimmy saver sailor she logged on on the bricks too you know prevent the poorest it\nOh the forests messed up the water going through I heard it's a good product that what's your thoughts on it and it will\nNow if it's chimps saver chimps there is a rubber coated mixed that goes over the crown a\nFor ... purposes that works the problem with that type of stuff is it holds in retains moisture\nSo if you have a crime that's already starting to go and you apply this stuff yeah she'll get a few more years out of it but you're also going to accelerate the deterioration underneath of that because the chimney is already the crime itself is already starting to go it's a it's a band aid product but it does work\nUm I was I I don't know if you're thinking about the same thing I Am it's called chimney saver effect like a clear liquid\nLive you're talking about a water sealer then tackling yeah yeah yeah I've ... [laughter] it's a good product there are some other products out there that that we use that are better but it is a good product\nSo what is it better product that you're thinking oh well\nSelect saying pd is a really good product um we were you you wrote a New Bedford area yeah um [noise] stay roadblock as his got it out of the roof six and Dartmouth and what's the name of that product in place a ... ... ... ...\n... they'll ... they'll know right off over there or if you're in the ... marry a highway concrete block has to\nBuy the locks and but that you know that that had a product\nIs ... is a commercial grade sealer um you know it's not your Thompson's water sailor at that stuff\nI appreciate time thank you next time [noise] [noise] right we're going to uh\nMakes that call like a\nRich and all each hang in there for a moment we we need to do a pause again for a couple of words from sponsors and we'll be back to take your call\n\nUs the chances a day every weekday

out to Arlene's and speak with rich rich welcome to the handyman outline\n[noise] hello bill I rich Johnny I hey\nI have a question I've ah put a lot of money into my roof recently I bought a house that needed everything basically not chimney down built it from the roof wind up or put it in copper flashing [noise] and uh put in a standing seem a little bit of ...\nAh everything is all set to go and wondering what else other than a cut the trees around the roof area so that this investment can be in them to littered on leave\nI'm just wondering and anything\nElse I can do healing the chimney or anything else like the last caller was mentioning to promote the longevity of this for long it can last\nYou know just making sure that Germany is it's a new generation just make sure in the spring only in the middle of summer you want to just make sure it's water field um other than that there should be no maintenance at all\nYou know from a tribute prospect of ... uh I Wonder what a CEO in the summertime you don't want to be sealing moisture into the ... it's like trying to water seal now while you're doing a silly moisture into the gym ... especially after day like today I mean they they like painters say the fall is about a ton of pain 'cause it's drier here\nNot the same for chimneys are not necessarily I mean if we get our ceiling time to June July August September once you start getting into October you start getting that morning and do stuff and then that's when you want to [noise] stops it [noise]\nGood to know [noise] okay well the ... the dealer with that negatively impacting anything that's below it that will feel maybe not the looming them or the copper or anything of that going to\nBe you know none at all I mean you'd want to put a drop cloth or the old school campus up there put it on with the forest paintbrush try to stay away from spring because you get much better coverage for the faint brushing you can control the most\nGuys [noise]\nWas helpful rich it was just and actually I Do have one more question about tax credits for ya and his running well any medical ritual running out of time if you want to wait to live over the news break a call back when he led to answer questions okay very well thank you rich by ... by\nAnd Eric we go to the news now we've run out of time All right we will be back in the second hour to answer your questions today on the handyman hauling\nWhen they call a professional or roofing side well or it but they they're going to be there immediately I had a lady wants telling me that she wanted to be done to the next day [noise]\nSo and I was surprised I wasn't even I haven't even seen her before then she told them you know and I asked are when are you planning to get to work that she was like well tomorrow afternoon\nAnd she was she was dead serious or you was in the ... and I told her that that's impossible I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to meet you tomorrow afternoon or ... things planned up and scheduled up so you know each each of these before for us it's impossible maybe to be somebody who might do this is the age of\nThe drive through window where you can get immediate service but doesn't that my ... let's go back out to the phones we have John and south Chatham calling us today John welcome to the enemy and outline and the host try that by John do we have you today\nYeah good afternoon I Know when you happen to you know somebody's got ... this is true so one of my\nRoof and so I haven't called gory because there were becoming because obviously on on a book to sort out the vote in the other guy I turned it if you turn on the ... or ...\nYears old I'm\nAnd one of them can only about because I'm going forward estimate and none of them before they all want to use certain to mark shingles fine but none of the four evergreen underline that they want and I was just wondering which\nYou know I've got a Fifteen pound fell a reversal of your roof runner type or ... or when support or something like that [laughter] I'm Still I'm just wondering which one you guys use\nAn do before answering your question I Need to know the pitch of the roof\nOr\nIs it the really shallow peach roof no no no it's a regular you would say Steve like not very stupid\nYeah regular medium talked to just a small crowded you know\nUsually I mean you know under layman semi needs the combination of 'em are usually if it's a city teaching goes then you're going to use reverse select I mean our winters aren't they some water you can Ruth Ruth front or paper but there are some areas to definitely need to be covered with ice and water shield which is the winters are right right so now I'm In one on the\nParts that aren't covered by the you know we're\nRunner is a nice part of to use it to honor layman also made by certain Pete in March and you've got to make sure that all the products that each one of his company's that he's suggesting to use are made by certain to eat the roof runner he's beyond are limited to synthetic ...\nWhich is a great product to work with and it's made by certain Pete so you can go with the roof runner and one will\nYeah excuse me what advantage does not have compared to the\nYou know the the ... for select I mean the fiber cross back no type of\n... with the differences is usually the uh the ice and water show gets ... and a complicated areas the winter guard right so you take you do not need to ice and water the entire section as long as seats you know over\nA three page four page where OK okay if it's less than four now\nIt's more for but I meant was you know in the bulk of the roof you know\nIf you're if you've got to understand the reverse elected so on is biscuit fiberglass well\nHe's just your choice whatever it doesn't really matter as long as you know he doesn't he's not going to affect the roof any way I ... is it that if it has been installed correctly okay it's basically a waiver barrier I may go to the fact of warranty at all\nWell if it's if if they don't use the right product it will affect the war in ... but if they use the product that is made by certain Pete if it's a film paper or roof runners synthetic paper\nEither one of those you can only use with the ... has to be ... will handle maybe certain to shingle yeah it has to be certain product in each state installed either one of the product as long as ... ... if they have installed it correctly there is no really difference\nOkay and I'm On the on the anthem Alice in the race and so on how you put in the ice and order on your inspiration there\nYes if we put a you should put ice ... you you don't have to use three people buy some water you can go Eighteen Inches away some water that's also a lot so you know you can you you can use I similar up on that either the owner aches as well\nBecause there are on the ranks I remember the there were there were open exposed and there are about twenty inches so\nYes you can absolutely use the ice and water I mean in that case I mean you know just use the full ruin my some water three feet of ice and water on the brakes\nOkay okay All right well thanks my British it not a problem\nI think your your neck package on\nMy folks that's how we do it you have a project going on you want to just rented by the experts we're the SARS five oh wait seven seven five nine nine eight five and we have Chris and Yarmuth who is also a hanging in the line per se Chris welcome to the handyman ...\nI think guys are are so anyway I have a little box that I was thinking about doing but I'm not sure the lady my addict and uh I was up there the other day because I had\nA knack conditioning system stalled all health system and I looked at the installation has been compressed like it's like below the or the rafters now not even up to that level of their asses you know and I measure to four inches or it looks like the fish and you know I don't know but um\nAnyways I was thinking about adding to it and I didn't know whether that go with the bad in Philly or it would blow and I'm Alone in inflation or I guess the new product is the um the phone I sell Asian\nBut I've heard that that can be you know and maybe with the chemicals that are really not sure which way I Want to go with that and maybe give me some suggestion\nYup then will the suggestion will be first of all I Would speak before even if it's a you know project that you're planning to do yourself a get a couple of opinions or cause you were just getting a feeling that you don't have enough insulation\nIt doesn't mean that you don't have enough insulation evolved I okay so the first thing I Would do is just talk to people that deal with insulation\nA there are companies like must save and it's an auto companies that can come and evaluate things solution you're addict\nOkay and they will let you know if you really do need more isolation if you'd or if you don't\nSo that's where I Would start if I was you\nWhy put those uh I like there's been put in some um that can ... you know all the inflation has been pushed aside you know and there's nothing of the you know is it right into the kitchen is on the addict so I Know I'm leak and a lot of areas like that\nWell then you can put the insulation lives areas where you have no insulation but he does it mean to like cause too much of anything can can be harmful because you know 'cause there's more to inflation because if you stop your addict would be solution you might get problems with ventilation\nTo Chris I ... I'm In a plane suggestion about getting some other opinions and he mentioned mass save [noise] if you call them you can actually get a free energy water done\nAnd then when they do that and is your it they'll look at your installation addict as well as other areas of the house they'll make recommendations they'll even give you a subsidized price to insulin addict and other areas you may find that it's going to be less money\nTo pay them to do it for you than it is I'll go out and buy the product can do it yourself\nSo a guy therefore you'll get both their recommendation and you'll get a a proposal and ... with ... subsidize pricing and or you may be pleasantly surprised so I thought a no brainer I'm going that route well everything is like\nThe thing is I just put it in this brand new it's like the ah air conditioning duct work with a one to the aluminum moving all around the addict and I don't want anyone to stop on opening day weather does this whether it be me or someone else that we all capital because everything you know as\nI down to the beans and you know I don't know how you know I just don't want everything stopped\nOn because it's so much of that to walk around my addict now\n... exactly most likely what they're going to do is uh blown and insulation that would be my recommendation to you [noise]\nUm because you cut the fiberglass in place which is good and the fiberglass probably has the vapor barrier or at the bottom which is a the ceiling does favor yeah so the the blown in insulation now will fill any any voids in we'll we'll build it up to a um a thicker level which will give you the the rating you want [noise]\nUm but it's also\nBeing in a a novice at this you don't know a lot of the nuances of the proper way to install it what to look out for by hiring a company that does it on an everyday basis they should know how to do it properly now you can also\nSchedule a day that's convenient for you that you can be home and you kind of saw to supervise of sorts in and let the crew no upfront this is all new duct work that's up there I'm concerned about being crunched um\nThey have ... too because the air conditioning April laid backing okay so that could access to the actually felt there on the um\nOn the air handler that I have to change so they they get that out outside the walkway out to the ... All right I don't know how you can buy all that stuff on that night that bind the backing\nBasically what were you spend on that area including the labor material the roof the skylight everything thirty percent of it you can get the thoughts a tax deduction\nThat do and if they don't the installing a solar powered skyline\nWell with the sun tunnel you won't get it but with the with the sky lights you will absolutely get it sold the roof area that is a bump the kitchen including the skylight including the war cold lean side work as well it's old tax credits\nOh that is about\nAnd this guy a guy like would give you\nGreater area a natural light\nI obviously well it's clear he comes in a bigger sizes semi you know there are there are certain size is that you can choose ... uh but it will be it will be more light coming through the skyline than willing to bet that it's on tunnel\nOkay\nNow what time it's your radical ... addict above the kitchen I assume right there's no secondary above their\nYeah ... you know second it's a it's a ad\nIn how is the house bill you know is it roof truss is or is it what we call stick built the any idea how the structure is\nBuilt Ruth Ruth tracts there's no roof [laughter] get out\nStick built okay so you have more flexibility when you have roof trust is you can't touch the trust [noise] see I like a two foot skylight to go in between them much stick built you can go for for why make a nice fall by for\nUm skylight but you know and and you can ... your walls to make kind of like a a a flare tunnel so it opens right up to the whole kitchen lot you can do when you have to stick\nTheir head they're there are options I mean all you need to do is just a few ... which one you like better but the ... you will get more sunlight daylight coming through this guy like\nVery good well that's what I like lower light\nA then that's good [laughter] it's\nA friend I'm going to give you a have on them and give you his phone number I been remiss in not having the boys are you about their number ...\nShe ... she can reach us up to five zero eight seven seven five yeah eight to four zero\nTwo boy pharaoh\n... ... you would do um and both the skylight and the roofing for her absolutely and then he added arrangement or a cop and during nine of them\nWe are certified by the looks which is basically the only skylights company around that may not last guy lights and you know we're certified by them with a handful of companies only on Cape and we can take care of it\nAnd when you look at them a skylights yes well\nThe there are a lumber yard is most of the lumber yard to carry them or have you with the probably the closest one to you will be the ... yeah after two yeah live but tell us we will will I'm pretty sure they carry the skyline told I don't buy my material from Patel was but they would they'd there's no way they don't have skylights\nI can tell you that arm and installed them in my house and you will love them during the\nBoy a frantic round for right now Frank question do you have room in the kitchen for a a new missionary fireplace show [laughter] so we're going to be on the line over open up to take care of that for you by your accent [laughter] [laughter]\nWell for and I appreciate your calling in anything else we can help me with today now that great thank you so much so thank you for calling me you stay dry today\nThey All right Bye bye\nAnd folks if you I Know a a pick the brains share of of our guests are myself you can reach us a five hour wait seven seven five nine nine eight five and we'll be glad to entertain your question and to give you our opinion or guidance whatever it is that ah you wish to speak about [noise]\nSo rainy days radiation I said you know to have that real would fire places in it it is getting a look at the the uh the wood\nLit up in a nice bright dry fire going and they just warm up the environment\nIt's it gets to a baseball game football games some auto racing\nEspecially when there's no sunshine out and you can I yellow flickering flames just add a little ... of the house break things up that's right\nYou can do them from scratch correct correct I mean I Know we talk a lot about repairing chimneys and and you know and getting on and on a hot water ... want to blame him for the leaking rules so Steve comes to the rescue and says now it's your flash it will take care of your\nYeah it's always the river ... syrup is full well we ... we we used to blame so I you know [laughter] how but\nStill I mean Mesa and fireplaces and the maybe not as common today but but still there are people who want to exactly we we specialize in a run for fireplace which is an older design from like a step back a hundred years ago for heating the light for cooking\nAnd they throw it a lot of heat may have a very shallow fire box and they have very efficient regardless what some people will tell you if you build them correctly\nGot to have the proper inner workings and you can make them\nVery efficient so yeah we'll get some he goes up the chimney obviously but a ruptured design reflects a lot of you know if they've built properly when you heat the fireplace up like and they fire a place that you can start if it's done correctly you can start backing off on the damper closing this Ronald down a little bit\nYou're still bringing up the smoke that you're directing more heat out into the room with a shallow five bucks\nYou actually get more heat out into the room that's that Robert design makes sense okay so it can\nIt matters who you hire to build these fireplaces ... somebody whose experience they don't want to hire roofers\nRight on I was you know in either handy to have anything else to do is go back to the phones here the uh the ... up\nIn a rich and all leans rich welcome to the handyman outline if we ban with together already today\nAt a question like if you went to a commercial break if OSHA glad to have you back yeah thank you my second part of the question was that um\nI was wondering if uh what kind of tax credits or I could take advantage of this I didn't look roof a maturity which is part of it to maybe\nGo with sort of solar system either photovoltaics for like a like a heating system which meant they will give them credit for it and what are those credit anyone knows\nYeah I'm not totally up to speed with different uh credits and now that ... was just talking about if you put any kind of a skylight in that that has the solar function than the skylight and on all things\nClose by to deal with it are eligible for for tax credits if you'd get solar panels and obviously the solar panels have their own tax incentives coming with it I'm beyond and I'm up to speed with anything because\nThere is a thousand dollar rebate on a new on the new heating systems I just finished my new home and I'm just just got that thousand dollar check back in the mail it was nice\nWell that's always nice to get some money coming in the mail says the bills in the mail exactly [laughter]\nBut I Would I Would uh the dish and research in would you know as much as Google but to somebody like mass save a obviously would would be a good source for any of the rebates that deal with with our homes because that's that's what they do um uh beyond that\nI were more basic work I don't think there are any ... you still need to speak to your accountant I think there'll be the best uh you know idea uh but uh [noise] uh you I don't really think you can get a lot of tax deduction and see if it was just the roof replaced on your house or the chimney rebuild\nA but if there are some solar products involved than\nYou might be eligible for some tax credits so speak talk to your account them do have some research on that
