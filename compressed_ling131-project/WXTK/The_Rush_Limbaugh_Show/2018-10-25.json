envelope\nAnd anything that goes to the nail it automatically get smart\nWhen other people have mentioned that but this was this was caught at\nNow wait a minute\nThe CNN your right to CNN did show up in their mail room with no cancellation on the stamps you're right about that some of the others were caught and nabbed in the distribution centers where there might not have been post march but you're on the CNN piece yeah you're right\nAnd I said it she stands that were placed on the animal it would not be enough to cover the cost to\nWell that's what I say they they came from the from the

throwing against the wall to\nTry to mess up the midterms or metal election is that what you mean or just to get any get Trump\nYeah any body that it's kind of I mean I had my fish into maybe behind it but and at this point I think that they are just in such chaos that they're just saying what stick\nTo it and they are in a tight OK after the whole entire\nWell if that's true and then it would certainly\nIndicate that they\nDo not believe in a blue wave at the very least\nAnyway I appreciate that Sarah thing no I'm not going to ask her who she thinks I'm not going there folks that I got a

Republican enthusiasm there's a reason why Republicans are out voting Democrats in early voting there's a reason for all of this upsetting the apple cart that's going on there's a reason why

Liz Harrington they're talking about the ... the the package bombs these these a mail order devices that I'm not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer\nStarts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who in leadership have condemned the attack he called for unity and you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president's nation instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for this country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time for family behind the president shameful I that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to put the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from anything I can think they'll ever and how have for the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't\nKnow named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story\nAnd they excuses by saying well\nWe must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump threatened for what they've got to deal with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility\nAnd why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump\nThrough the meanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is in the show on a top response\nI think that the president controls himself emphatic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking\nFun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning he tweeted that it was CNN his fault which basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that CNN and was responsible for that to get the fake news that they're spreading because no one's fault but the arranged maniac sending does\nI Hope of all let me just add a van and that's what you want to be on the record a matinee idol python showed up and not culpable\nFor in the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park depicting the assassination and the president\nSaying that the leader right\nNow you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about ... like blaming\nA I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um\nThe conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... thing for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone in guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language in Atlanta and every time than ... Harris Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he always thought the president come out of his core into what America stand for black man if I Want to see an end she may tell can blame it on the president can blame it on ... John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move forward forward fight have kept the low road President Trump the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what you're heavier yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from ah I I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case it and he is being interviewed\nI I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nHave a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily\nAnd then all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go I Phil Donahue your students all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\n\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border edits it what difference it made for me it if they started installing the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically unfair that was\nThat would just say the De Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before true see and then it got there and the Clinton has so far as\nI Know that there's a ... film Griffith and that they had like four or five of them shows up all the exact same time we're out of you know it was a priority mail\nIt it could have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller is your what I was going to one of the Congress house can they can the fact that there wasn't enough postage on if you had the post office he even accept it\nUm the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages that you're not taking advantage and paying for this you know having them weight and paid and profit properly\nUm your you'd have to stick the post office box I well first off the ... even having a friend with an oversized packages\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that some of them actually did show up at the residents so you're going to have the fat\nOkay what what are you suggesting that and what are you suggesting happened\nI think I'm from I'm Sorry that I just I mean he's the workers are trained to look for the trees are you looking packages cheesy if your joke and it looks like a joke even if I can see that there's something in there and if you look at their interests too don't you think that after going through it\nNow wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I wouldn't know I haven't been\nTrained I don't work the post office so I haven't been trained but I I've looked at these things and knowing after the fact that they're that
