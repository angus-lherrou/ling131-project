Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the tunnel since that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat canal say packing us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poke in the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb\nTo the temptation here to go blob vi and to become flap one and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting them in countries that can Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does mean\nIt is about\nTime this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America in the way it was founded in the snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent and\nThey're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat it's so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him of some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election there's a big deal psychologically until many of these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive\nBy media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed mother has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it in the most opportune time\n\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nDid happen between Hillary\nMen are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy\nUh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now Rick have bank and they get unfair

[noise]\n... lemons that was it on Monday Night on CNN and its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo about all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another\nHave filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know as a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow John Lennon uh what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy Bannon but that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust\nAn unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using the victim allergy and victimhood and to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for goodness in decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you in the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing there's people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget\nOr don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive

where there are fifty four where are you parity yes indeed that was\nGreat long to hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline went down\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where did I go down\nIn leaders Taiwan Area but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking that hell I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see in\nAffecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when they decided that time to attack a corporation\nLike bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was they were sucking ... uh they were in the last place out there\nAnd this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don women even ask a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nCan't specifically remember that Americans have broken well okay so ... ... but they\nThey had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success\nIs to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlets whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what she wanted to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw it on the headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning morning the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program and look\nFor I just found it to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes down on that many people especially it was a brand new planet\nOr whether you're such a brand new playing what kind of plant was he says ... what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be one of the time you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the streets sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide\nBody and\nNot as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed entered the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... and so\nThere's no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nRush Limbaugh does for you the best school do on the ... the\nIn our house

will [noise]\nAnd so we are in Cape Cod local news authority WICK west you are much Cape Cod and I urge radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nABC News I'm David right the mid\nTerm elections now less than a week away and the number of Americans casting their ballots early appears to be way up\nFrom their customers consumers that any other business out there any other retail business I think the news business\nHas people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business\nWho ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news\nBusiness does but the news media has a habit and that is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf that momentum was interrupted if that energy level declined and wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nYeah fertilizers thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he's pumping a\nSeries of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know what his messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was\nYou know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to happen on election day and I don't believe in the hills does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the end not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close we don't know\nWe never know until the aftermath here's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nYou know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan talked the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the cabin on hearings remember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations that whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial raped we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets ... get the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all it just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going camping I was a big rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made public thing I've dug terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nRepublicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start\nIt is getting a Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nUm but I was shocked when I when I had I heard them as a as a sponsor and I had to do with official welcome when I heard that because it really is a stunning I have no idea such a thing was even possible but it is\nNow people have asked me to rush one of the apple watch only ever watch is going to do the same thing is that they have an activated the fee tree out the way it's going to work in the apple watch\nAnd it's only the series for you gotta have the brand new apple watch it will not work on all of them so it's not going to be as widespread as the of the cardio device here can be K.

phones we go to Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much closer when my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession as he was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class of courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph what\nMost people don't understand is when these millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in the way if Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship is specially looking at their eyes they take a device him sick open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quick not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved\nWith gold and then I found out I was going to be the one ... streets\nBut we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it's\nUm I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was hurt because I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history buffs all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey of\nThe most popular high school history textbook\nIt found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in an American\nHistory the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much I'm Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice and Alice ... not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nAnd we were much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nWhen apple announced that the new ... book is made of one hundred percent recycled\nAluminum the young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect of any of these gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed into propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes\nNow let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here truckers hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did gum they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center president\nTrump first lady you Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting\nThat\n\nAre coming back to reach me I think you're going to\nThank you so much [laughter] I can keep happening chances\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere\nThank you thank you President Trump that you will block it thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you all very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protests were not surprise you nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your ship trip and I thought this was not your place you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking him not to\nCome oh wait we're not true we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nAnd now I'm a lot of the first lady and is Monica Trump gets to love to\nThank you very rainy summer\nThank you very much had her name is John John you may be longer [laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jared cushion are saying nobody ever heard of you laughing that his wife was a bigger star\nThat's fine no problem everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants to NATO property where she everybody hates ... everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything and everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you get a reaction to real people you will not see those videos you will not fear that audio anywhere\nOn that and reduce the number one talk with your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy like be\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload to ...\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's nice\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what's conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nI can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it\nJust totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was Don ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are damn certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds ... greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than\nAnybody else does I have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their poll\nAnalysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\n\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final\nStretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\n\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr Trinidad that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree\nOkay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats in the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not just ... days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially\nThis year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers this adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one\nParty or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr\nPrint day here is we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... ... to be can think of where it might turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality a penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point but the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't is\nIt going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise]\nThen the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and mark\nErases like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seats but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how about my apple aren't on the state\nAnd then the next ... are we relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next\n... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still\nIt's over we're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story what else is working out very well that's\nProbably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh or\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I happen to live just idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize is one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nA it's a [noise] I dunno it's\nUnfair I forget the term they use but the reason is effective it's effective against the left and so Google\nIs a man and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and if there's a journalist David ... who ah who writes at a quote on his work here a bunch of time and he's out saying something that I have\nMentioned on this program countless times and I ... the Democrat Party\nIs the drive by media and vice versa drive by meaty is the\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power\nA behind the Democratic party and Mr are saying you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was a Mollie Hemingway and gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are six simply aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and by the way be unbiased if if that's true if a number of these things are true then they're convert will be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this and the bad\n[noise] do when you
