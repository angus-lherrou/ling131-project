I think you might actually see\nIt I I for the first time in in probably thirty thirty five years I think you are going to see higher wage increases for service providers people that actually do things as opposed to for paper pushers 'cause the the the the investment bankers and the financial sector\nHas been making a fortune for Thirty years I think that's about to change I think it is our life\nIs I think the the need to get things done right people when you look at a year high school graduating class how many of them went in to become electricians plumbers carpenters not a ton probably negatively about you how about you talked\nTo John ... I'll tell you what so my my second cousin who lives out in Michigan ... she's seven sixteen or Seventeen years old now she can become a welder yeah couldn't be like I I heard it a couple of weeks ago and I was I'm like oh that's awesome but they know my my\nPoint is we we have this in a large gap\nWhere people didn't go into trades and physical work I think now we've reached the tipping point where those physical workers whether you're UPS drive or whether you're a welder a carpenter electrician or a plumber you're going to say hey if you want me to show up I'm not showing up for twenty thirty forty bucks an hour it's gonna be sixty is going to be eighty it's going to be a hundred bucks an hour\nI agree on that but I also think that the people at the top and they're not going to see themselves making less all of a sudden\nOn a relative basis I think their rate of increase will slow compared to the bottom the bottom fifty percent I think the the masses just because of demographics and demand I think it's going to change\nHe had the whole generation you guys you you're ... like when you went to high school was there did you take shop class did you learn how to wire or do a lot trickle were not work on a car and pottery those classes there was a car class available and there was like would shop and stuff but I didn't\nI didn't watch out for two years actually you know if I wasn't very good at it but I did it will never be a carpenter my\nPoint is when you need to hire a carpenter your and pay for\nIt I I agree I just I I don't see anything that changes that slows down you know overall growth for the top end in the long like I I just I I don't see it like what what changes there\nI think the change isn't so much on the top and\nSlowing as it is the bottom and Ray Rice which has the same that affect it does so if topping ... let's say ... wage growth the top one percent it's been growing at five percent then that means\nThey the the workers that I'm referring to skilled trades people I think you're going to see them growing at ten percent or more rapid rate do because there aren't enough of them they just you try hiring some tried getting electrician to come up to\nYour house so it's it's tough though if if if you can find if it's two hundred and fifty bucks for a basic service called where they're in and out in twenty minutes yeah you're you're you're is just the way it is yeah it's I I agree on all that I just I\nIn this world today I don't see things changing that quickly on the top and though and that's that's the thing is I I still see the top end of the rising quickly now do\nThe Dow is down five points NASDAQ is off forty six points and we've got the price of oil down three sets of Berlin Seventy one thirty one and the ten year

election\nAnd not that he says they have to win the house and Senate to save\nAmerica no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats in the American left want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\nThey\nCare about that they are willing to force\nWhat they think America should be America's transformational on everybody but\nThankfully they still have to win elections and I still maintain that I don't know when that somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't doubt me I Know these people but only a Democrat folks\nWould think there are reports from scientists\nSaying that she might be one one

celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis that to you know the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay unless you're not to try it again I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining\nNATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got an a roster coming up probably do\nBut he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating and some of the things I Would tell them about my opinion is that the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I I think\nThat's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York state I made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised\nBy this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased and I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but they knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about\nDemocrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment he

watch the gay West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Aaron ... the Washington Post journalist last seen walking into a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey nearly two weeks ago President Trump says the Saudi king denies knowing anything about Mr Trump won secretary of state Mike Pompeo to get to the bottom of things in person\nTheir taxes and yet how often do you hear every problem both parties\nPoliticians running around and we're going to middle class after the middle class pregnant burners through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to wake up in Texas\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid\nThree percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThat top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth of a percent for teen hundred\nTaxpayers\nThat group alone pain free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little round that the fourteen hundred and fourteen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the\nTop one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich not decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene hungry\nPeople out of three ... some odd million is it fair that fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent combined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we are going to ... bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nHe thought Donald Trump look like he was thinking racist thoughts listening to

were going on in Trump's had my curiosity\nWasn't about what came out of ... miles from my wonder went to what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay if other than a warm serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black clubs Trump these black urban Obama ... sad\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the\nRacist here the son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot pinpointed\n\nAnd my house in an educated guess are the critical moment it was like an educated guess hearing it on ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side this guy's going to do wonders for\nMe how does he know what's going on in Trump's then\nThey have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I this is the kind of think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him it befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number this is a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity\nOf consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents at the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painting them for San Juan Forero who launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with tonality then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people isn't a porn star console you gonna go back to that cat in the last is\nLesley from coming into our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states\nYou know my fault Leslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there this\nLaw on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation and just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't enforce it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely Ronald law or just enacted one that separating children from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise\nSome guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nHero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families when it's a law that he inherited\nI've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally of has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nAnd even a modicum amount of respect similar\nTo what other presidents have got yeah he's right about that these people despise him they still despise him and they're always going to simply because they can't get rid of him\nThey've thrown everything that they know that Donald Trump they have tried every maneuver every strip the jury every tactic\nThey have tried everything that has always work getting rid of Republicans they have tried intimidation they've tried threats they've tried wise they've tried reporting a bunch of stuff that isn't true\nThey have tried intimidating voters they've done everything that has always made other Republicans back off\nOr cave or sue for peace or what have you and Donald Trump does not respond to any of it\nAnd I loved is challenging the way she asked him the questions in the way she is not following up on his answers the way she would with others\nWill take a break and your phone calls are coming up right after

talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti Pelham a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her core percentage is so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now to that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this world is is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out of me for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA co habitats with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activism and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor\nOr oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and the recent white privilege stuff pops apps absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just a minute sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nAfrikaners are not black uh well I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks in okay All right\nI just want his best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent and some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Sahara Desert or which is where most of the population of Africa is\nMost of it there is some\nNorth of the Sahara Desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that and not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics
