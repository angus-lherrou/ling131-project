that\nBut Cooper would be a really really interesting fit here and I think\nHere's what I'll tell you about Cooper is they're asking for a one\nThey've been offered a two and said no Reggie McKenzie is the one who's handling the trades wait they got offered a super Cooper yes I'll forget it the patriots are out and I don't know if they got an offer to they got offered it to for Cooper is\nSome teams believe that if ... gets involved in the ... because he's what McKenzie handle it to this point yeah some people some people believe that if they can find a way to escape scrutiny involves himself like all of a sudden and the prices on these writers veterans who are on the market or\nMaybe then that means he goes to the team that operate the two right which I don't think it's New

you know give me your thoughts on Mr mislead where we head into the game [noise]\nNothing like what we saw last week the watching them warm up um\nYou know he looks like I Would say more like a

is very rigid in his drop in his delivery uh but I think I'd be more concerned on thirty three and four today but this guy will pick up pick it up what his legs so run that reduction and they're going to try and go a little power I run to that is so we'll see what he does I don't think we're we're in for what we face last week with a Patrick miles\nSo what's the plan of attack here for the patriots against ...\nI guess the first of all run it again try and stop trying to develop that run as they've been doing for the last couple of weeks without Gronkowski being there was really good off the edge but I mean ... really good run blocker off were disappointed at ... you know made the trip but he did not it was downgraded the out\nSo uh you know it's a guy that they kind of had some high hopes for to be sort of an age back opposite Gronkowski he had the longest she now he's got a hamstring issue seems like he's a ... ticket on film [noise]\nSo anything else a standout you ...\nI just think you know watch a Brady it's a lot more throws to element Gordon Edelman Gordon Hogan back and forth a sort of where I don't say door set of getting phased out but\nYou know if they change the gamble game plan a week to week where source that might not snag one and it might be gored and it gets ... today I think you unveiled just gotten a little bit more do they just based on what we've seen a warm up there so far [noise]\nDo any sort of concern about the safety play last week and in Nobel jak was pretty forthright about that McCord is performance\nIf you if you ever see that skill set again I Would say yeah but I just\nYou know today you see a little bit similar stopped going back it'll come out of the backfield I'm Gabriel can fly Gabriel can fly here you've got to tighten burden who got you on the Phillies special on the super bowl he's the guy the throat the falls I got a million bucks to come here to three years twenty four million God Bless him and uh you know they got some guys don't run those\nThose trick routes on the outside beat all the same weight Philly did it the rubber out with a double vertical to stress to what you're asking about gas for the safety so I just think they said back today keep you know minimize the big place over the top like last week [noise]\nSecond was known as we get ready for patriots and bears in Chicago kickoff coming up at one o'clock I'm as you look at this game do who do you think it's a bigger game for our fence or the fence coming off last week when\nI think it's the past the ... ... up to speed now I Know that what plays out there but at thirty eight thirty eight forty three [noise] you know they're starting to hit on all cylinders but with the tight end out\nI don't think it's that much of a big deal because he really hasn't been a focal point the last couple of weeks and the fact that woman's they're not to ... go to today but the the pets it's got to sort of replicate what they did last week in the first half making a sixty minute game set up a thirty minute game they need to play for game here today [noise]\nYeah there's no question about that I mean you know again I think that first happened\nHow well they played sort of got lost and the second half and giving up to thirty one points and to me that sort of been a story this even for the defense is inconsistent and you'd like to see them put it together you know today against the Chicago Bears and I think this is a quarterback that you can pool and to the mistake\nAnd I I just say to that mean watching the game atmosphere it's a little more subdued I'm not a juice place here in Chicago in lotta patriots fan so it's going to be interesting to see if we get to lead the hottest crowds going to go\nA lot of patriots fan mail is ... ... it's a good city yeah you see a lot of them around and soldiers to be a\nGreat city to visit I think oh yeah you know typically plays into it as to whether or not a ... going to make the trip [noise]\nUm do you think there's a bad spot for the patriots dope considering bears coming off the last well could win and the patriots so have this thing hanging over them that I don't think it's that big of a deal and that is that they haven't won on the road I just think rain overall and their level of plays in a much different place now where it was a month ago well I think\nBecause of the way they came out of the gate on the road goes back to back wakes not good um they stress it this way so they should be focused that should be hitting on the hill towards mental mistakes that many today\nUh Saddam out here and working with the Lyman early just get it going I'm mentally they got to be ready for the gecko come up because I think this is a team you could get up on a naked I don't say pack it in but\nI Know they're sitting there are three and three you could say it's a bigger game for them I think it's a big one for New England I Do think it's a good spot for them or are you talking about maybe a tricky spot coming off a big win against Casey now you got to win on the road you're going anywhere in Italy you got to be able to win on the road this year two thousand Eighteenth starts for them today\n[noise]\nOkay [laughter] no yeah no we're good yeah I'm back here so I tried Clemens trip uh clipping nails no I'm I'm back here I got nothing else boy you covered it all alone and we're good man you know I was about the field but I Can't see it back to you know what the real quick\nHere too we did talk about the grass multiple times they replace described since ... longer than the normal natural surface because of the weather but it looks really good it looks really good in the middle\nWay so it's it's longer meaning what like they want to grow\nThe hey don't I'm not a tight yeah it's not a Miami in Jacksonville um even here you know the New England practice ills back home they're cut really really short really tight like a golf green yeah they say they're like ... this is the patriots of two thousand three and four type track\nSo it's like an old high school field looks good it's good green it's good green grass ...\nAbout ... your feelings you check do you like the music the music here is good\nYeah they got Jay ... he's a inhouse DJ so uh two the two stadiums we've been to Miami which is a zoo to freaking nightclub the plan and uh now all of a sudden the Chicago Bears having it on the job which is sad but you don't like that I thought you were elected and I thought the music I got to it so that wants to make deal that as a DJ\nSo so so you just found

surgeries that he's had but it seems function well while without a what a Super Bowl without himself concern not immediate because you have got like John scored now where I\nThink you could start to

... elements that go to guy yeah that was you're right\nIt's what Sony Michel potentially get another hundred yard game it's a really good ... going up again but you got Michelle James why use your

more so than to Leo Mac and for the ... they had him here today he's in uniform we watch them go through warm ups but he is still somewhat of a question mark because of ...\nHe looked like he was about forty to fifty percent of warm ups meaning\nHe's going to do what he has to do to make sure he's right again time doesn't want to put any stress on that ankle so it was kind of lollygag and

you know what I'm saying [noise]\nSo I think you know stay at home on the outside that porch what's going to come up with why let's see one of the middle of the things you can do to send somebody with your front I thought I heard from a lot of say a foreign country in the restaurant last\nIs within a designated patrolling area\nNights go for the makers of the road but they say that the data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot\nThey're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice scape says they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it costs between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts\n[noise] All right when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible\nTo them that's right and twenty six Tina drone came with in two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what if that collision has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of loony am twenty plane and then a drone\nWas a DJ I fandom to quad copped or it's two point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the phantom wasn't certain to his forty foot cannon released at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoon through chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the link to damage its\nMain weight bearing spar and other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to something even more frightening yes Facebook that's right I told you last week about the new Facebook video camera and microphone it looks like like a mini tablet it's a a home assistant they say it's got to compete against\nGoogle Home apples home pot and Amazon's Alexa and Facebook called their hardware the Porto\n... why would anyone trust Facebook enough to put a Facebook powered microphone and video camera in their living room or kitchen I mean you just look at Facebook's history of lack of privacy they don't care anything about our security\nSo the Web site Recode actually wrote that on their site I'm going to read it to you\nKnow data collected through portal even called logged at her ... usage data like the fact that you listen to this spot of fly will be used to target users with ads on Facebook ...\nA year right okay they say they wrote that because that's what they were told by Facebook executives are you ready here's the shocker\nThe data about who you call the data about which apps you use what you'd do on this portal\nWill be used to target you with ads on Facebook and other Facebook own property so yes Facebook gets another data stream where it's advertising targeting business which is where you again or the product\nYou buy this and as I like to say you really are a schmuck her Burke [noise]\nAlright Christmas is right around the corner and some of the hottest selling items this year for gifts or we're talking about smart speakers\nAnd of course you've got smart watches specifically the apple wash for they started about four hundred dollars depending upon storage and whether it works on Saturday there but why by that when you get the luck to watch for okay this is an apple watch for someone who loves boiling\nIt features Eighteen carat gold version comes in yellow rose were white gold an alligator strap

[noise]\nAll right everyone knows that sleep is important we all feel better when we have a great night sleep don't we I Know that I Do and it's so good for your health now the mattress you sleep on affects whether you have a good night's rest or not\nAnd a few minutes laying on a show room mattress let me tell you that's not a significant amount of time to truly know if this mattresses for you and that's why I Want to tell you about my new Casper Sleep mattress I sleep cool I sleep comfortable every single night because it's\nHas this unique combination of phones that provide the just the right pressure relief in a line that and I know that once you try Caspar I'm telling you you're in love yours as much as I Love mine I mean switching to Casper is a no brainer folks at the high quality mattress at an affordable price what's great\nIs Casper ships right to your door for free in a small alley heck did they do that size bucks and here's even better if you don't love it they're

well thank you Jim I appreciate that appreciate that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today well I should have minded my own business\nBut you didn't I\nDidn't have an acquaintance too recently\nAh reconnected with a a daughter he hadn't been buried when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born a racially reconnected to the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she was like a no avail us failed miserably\nOh man so you're going to wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years\nOld okay All right so she's Twenty years old and that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really\n... about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had ... origins a January twenty Eighteen oh that's not very much of a social you\nKnow not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend\nMore about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or what all all of\nThe above okay uh she does that for for money or they're not rich by any means ah ah the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nOh I'm sure and then all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay\nI I'm just a bystander and all that [noise] well\nHere are a good friend I mean you're worried about right you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned in a red leaf so uh I don't

because Germany click and other places are and then of course there's jobs surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and the you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out there\nI don't think he wants anybody ... think oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know oh [noise] boy you have a you have an uphill battle all around right\nWhat does your gut telling you a might get is telling me that\nShe is his daughter and I don't think she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's gonna be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you
