{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "She's just pop you sat guys there's a heck of a guy but I just love the ... just saying\nI just love the golly gee uh we didn't really want to come out in Tel Aviv about this\n[laughter] uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh\nSo it's a it's an interesting a race\nIn some ways I actually feel a little bad for will Crocker 'cause it in some ways I think he's just been outmaneuvered ah [noise]\nOn a level of political consultancy and a political radio ads are so it's it's interesting to watch how that's going to work out I don't know the scuttlebutt is is the ... got a problem in this race and you could see a um an upset from this newcomer and again I Want to emphasize everybody\nAbsolutely acknowledge this Paul ... particularly this metal that he got for his heroic actions wonderful stuff not putting it down at all just putting it in the context of local politics and\nTrying to be an unbiased observer of what I'm seeing playing out here and you've got all of the local newspaper and I do who doesn't love the local newspaper\nThere are all um they are all for ah you know it would seem a running stories that\nMaybe help out candidates that they you know one might say you kind of like a as opposed to the other guy just saying All right that's I put my I I put I put enough out there now to make somebody mad at me I'm sure if you'd like to comment on on that or any other politics that are going on I Do want to talk about these\nAre terrible story at this a synagogue or a Lebanon shot dead\nA ...\nHas to do with the anti Semitism has to do with a a gun control just an awful awful story and then of course this fellow mailing knees or a pipe bombs [noise]\nAh to all the uh ... uh outspoken Trump or people out there right before getting right before an election or how that's going to affect the national election do no one quick call gene and then take the break\nYou trust me okay a fiber wait seven seven five W actually can get you on everybody feel free to to comment on my buddy ... joined us John good morning you're an ws decay\nThank her bra at all fill in for you here for a little bit uh two quick points of the shooting down in Pennsylvania\nI'm just amazed Pennsylvania is a is a state where it's easy to carry firearms and nobody in the congregation at a firearm on them during this a celebration of a child birth\nI I just don't understand why nobody was able to fire back I mean even at two shot their injure within twenty feet is quite dangerous\nAnd that could have ended the entire scenario right there but it's just troubling but nobody took advantage of this and then secondly you have a number of democratic candidates on in the past and they all stated\nThey do not support the federal laws that prevent sanctuary cities in other words they won't immigrants to come in to Massachusetts and then just go on the backs of taxpayers to be with welfare\nOh why are you going for office then you're not going to uphold their oath of office which states that they must support the Massachusetts and the United States Constitution which includes immigration laws that they might not like what do you think\n[noise] well there are different opinions on this one to be cynical is that the Democrats tend to do that because these people one way or another maybe because they they become citizens legally\nOr they eventually will vote for Democrats so that's their fledgling a party or supporters but that's the cynical a a a point of view another point of view dawn and I think there is some validity to this\nIs is that are illegal immigrants a need to be afforded some protections are they are not all mass murderers or Democrats will tell you as the president will will tell you they they are murderers and rapists\nAnd they do ah contribute to the economy or they're not out breaking all kinds of laws and they do need to be afforded some protection in some uh help\nBut but shouldn't the people the mass of of the United states have laws that set of guidelines those who is to come here and shoot who shouldn't be we shouldn't take every three and math and then you know why would pile up here in this country we didn't have to winnow out and spend some people back why can't they just\nYou know lawfully and legally asked can be a citizen and if they're refugees after the problem is\nResolved back in their home country should go back home again and they shouldn't become American citizens while they are if they're just seeking refuge from a bad situation\nLike leave you with this thought because what you said the last part of what you just said I Would think everyone could come to agreement on yeah we ought to be able to clean up America ought to be able to streamline this thing better and do better at it but this is an old issue it's been going on before Donald Trump\nAnd for some reason our federal government can't seem to get its act together when it comes to\nAppropriately uh letting people into the country and streamlining it and making it work for everybody I have to think ... maybe they don't entirely believe it or not they really don't want to fix the immigration I'm\nSystems you know you're you're you're exactly right quickly is this the only way that Democrats can people can get people into their party noticed shameful\nNot only I but it's a point that that that that does come up Don thank you I appreciate the call we've got a a break we'll be back ... service on what looks like a pretty nice looking a Sunday Morning\nAnd a wouldn't take

eight eight W X. two K. nine or five one we're talking a lot of about politics a been a lousy Seventy two hour news cycle eleven dead at a uh a synagogue\nA in a Pittsburgh uh this guy down in Florida mailing a fourteen or so allegedly a mailing a pipe bombs to ah people who are critics of a President Trump President Trump out on the stump like he's campaigning for his life\nUh you would think it was a presidential year it's not them but he's smart guy and he's out there ah storming the country and Kee ah places of for Republicans because he does not want to lose the house of representatives the polls as I pointed out\nA few moments ago the polls clearly are in a favor for the Democrats whatever that's worth a look at the polls show that the Democrats will take the house if if if that happens\nAnd there is a blue wave in this country uh two things how will it affect races around the country at the local and state level good question\nUm the Cape cod you got a lot of races with a lot of new young or just new Democrats who've decided to take on very prominent you would think a solid um\nRepublicans and they're clearly here just on the Cape there are a few a local races there really worth watching it's not clear if the incumbents going to be able to survive and the blue wave may in fact um [noise]\nUh it may end up being a variable across the country and the other thing of course is this ...\nNot a who mailed these um a pipe bombs to people how will that play if at all in the election or with people does that fire up a the Democratic base which I Would submit to all of you is already fired up\nUh I think particularly on commercial talk radio there is a lack of appreciation\nI'm not saying you agree with that I'm not putting the president down I'm just saying I think there's a lack of appreciation or acknowledgment of just how deep and widespread the hatred of Donald Trump is among Democrats um\nI don't think I'm being dramatic on the radio when I say there are many many of them they are livid they are furious they hate his guts and they are going to strike\nAnd they're going to strike hard I may be wrong but I don't think that I Am in the polls say yeah that's would appear to be the situation Donald Trump cannot lose the house of representatives it will be a bloodbath politically speaking for his administration if those Democrats\nUm Maxine Waters and the Nancy Pelosi's of the world if they get into power on November the six they may not or they may try to impeach\nDonald Trump on what charge I don't know\nBut\nBelieve me they can come up with something and get articles of impeachment against president look what happened with Bill Clinton\n[noise] um but at the very least what they will do if the Democrats control the house of representatives they will absolutely torture Donald Trump they will form all kinds of committee to investigate him\nOr they will just torture that man a until the twenty twenty elections let's go to a phone calls and rich thanks so much for your patience man and good afternoon Iran WXXI decay\n... brought Cape Cod or Ron Paul functions that [noise] that deal with the um oh what a couple of things the crux of\nRhetoric crude like walk her up and you tell me what why we supported where Walker\n[noise] I'm not sure I understand what you're asking can I tell you why we supported locking Hillary Clinton up\nHere\nI I can but I'm not sure why are you asking the question\nThat's ... he's been although I speech ... one of the reason for\nWell over the counter now I get a shoe or a ... a lot of people think that Hillary Clinton uh she lied to the authorities are about or what information she had on computers and and what she using the appropriate computer for national security reasons\nShoo shoo rich Howard ... I I think I wrote it or whatever but I think it's I think though is fair to try to be fair\nAbout President Trump a memory I ... I voted for the guy so I'm not an anti Trump or but it got to be fair about this man and his rhetoric has his is his talk on on the stump\nOr even now sometimes rich it goes a little too far and one ... maybe one would think that the president is actually calling from violence sometimes with the way you said ...\nOkay well I think they don't want to talk to vote is the um [noise] what you call which one of our founding fathers that we are torturing requires a moral people you're you're ...\nOr ... or you don't mind your was but that if somebody said it and so when I asked you to work out\nHe worked in the yes he did volunteer work you\nDon't ... I guess because I Believe that the one book Oregon what the White House\nThey should've been rule or they go to a gym a lot but they should have been removed from the Democratic party [noise]\nNow I say this rich about that race between now will crack Ron Paul cue sac and yeah I I\nI work I go there\nBut I ... well yes yes he has and then ... doesn't deny that but I'm just telling me that is a very competitive race Mr ... Mr Cusack hasn't as a really good story to tell he's got the local newspaper who's helping tell part of a story\nUm and it's a competitive race\nCould be what they already do not moral standards they they they hit a wall standing up on the experiments that were sure there\nAre rich I find a lecture what it's like that perhaps just off to help us but I got the moral ... years old that to me that's why they are out there working\nWorking for all I noticed when uh you start talking about morality in either the Republican or the Democratic party it's a it's a it's a big glass house so you want to be careful when you start throwing sauce rich I got I got to move on to some of these other callers before I enjoy your your campaign thing a gun works\nOr enriched by by I think he said Jeff deal was was coming [noise] five oh wait seven seven five W ... eight eight eight ws decay nine five one have their body and good afternoon urine ws decay\nBad how are you a color in the last hour who was wondering why\nA no dust on either one of them they both stood there ah ground some disagreement burn respectable away both gentleman really good solid a debate there was ... there are some drama\nOr for you if you didn't get a chance to hear the debate or this morning from ten to eleven if you go to the I hard app type in ... there are all the shows in debates for you to look at the gym and sandwich joined us hey Jim and good afternoon your annexed decay\nI bet ... well thank you\nI'd like to just offer a couple of perspectives on the upcoming midterm I'm I'm One who generally votes democratic and I will be probably voting democratic in the midterms\nAre but one of the things I wanted to bring up is that I think a lot of Democrats like me are not interested in continuing with the leadership of I'm Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Chuck Schumer and the Congress\nAnd I I see a young Congress people like I'm Seth Moulton leading something of a palace revolt and I'm with them\nI think I'm posting Schumer who really stayed at the table too long I think a lot of Democrats are looking for leadership\n[noise] I Would not agree disagree with you I as I understand it Nancy Pelosi should the Democrats a gym a winner November six and they might I understand that this is what I read that that there's a lot of um\n... within the Democratic ranks about her continuing in a leadership role certainly being house speaker vows\nWell I've read that too and um I'd like to see if in fact the Democrats do take the house that they would be new leadership there the only thing I wanted to mention as uh\nThink I'm more of a typical water in that I don't go to straight chick\nI said I was going to be a probably voting more Democrats but I'm going to support the governor in the race or in this state and I'm also supporting Randy hunt and I'm\nOne of the things that has disturbed me I'm from Stan which has disturbed me about the people support a Jack Stanton is that they're playing the card that somehow Randy isn't a native hero stand with him that he's going to retire in Texas I read that and\nTo me that's really a low blow I Know Randy I Know that he's worked in town all it takes the spin rep for a number of years he's got a business out I think that's really a a really unfair slap on the knees or Republican I'm going to order\nFair enough well state a gym I appreciate it thank\nThank you appreciate you're listening I Know there are more people we're out of time my producer Jim TSE it's given me all kinds of hand signals no more of that\nReal quickly though I have just enough time or to do a little political handicapping if you are following local politics the Cape and islands state Senate race between John florists\nAnd Julie in Sierra that's another competitive race in my opinion I think it's going to be tough for John but I ... it's a competitive race\nA Julian seer is not going to be defeated ah the outer Cape Town the province towns of the world they are very strong the islands are very strong Democrat\nOr And Julian or is a tough competitor himself people underestimate a senator or see here but it's still a race I think uh the bears\nA close or watching the fat lady has not song and she wants thing until November sex on that race and then the or Barnes Noble state rep race between well Crocker or in this new fellow appalled Cusack um\nWill get this a new line of high tech eye glasses something called ... it's actually hoping to be the glasses that you'll light to where first they actually look\nNot too bad I mean they don't look like nerdy glasses like Google Glass did\nAh there's you can have a classic square shape around shape prescription non prescription\nBut there's a lot of taking those lenders a whole a graphic displays

update turn by turn directions you name it\nYou can also order over wow great do you want to go hands free you can say Alexa show me the weather and if you wear the smart glasses backwards it can read your mind All right maybe not\nAll right I ran across this next story over at the New York times I\nThink about this data collection speaking of technology how much do you think your personal data is worth I mean everything that you do every website that you visited everywhere you go the TV shows that you watch the products that you buy it's all fair game for advertisers\nNow even when you take the kids temperatures listen to this this flu season Clorox paid kittens at the tech start up\nThat sells Internet connected thermometers now these aren't the Mummers we used to have his kids like you know mercury Glasser monitors\nThis smarter on murder will sync up with a smartphone app that allows you to track fevers and symptoms okay get this\nThe data shows Clorox which ZIP codes around the country have increases in fevers\nClorox then directs more advertisement to those areas assuming that house oh they're going to be the market for products like what do you think this infecting wipes yes you follow me Kansas says they have sold more than five hundred thousands thermometers\nAnd the data's coming right out I'm In real time people don't have to visit a doctor to search for symptoms on Google or post something on Facebook about being sick so now Ken the is\nSelling its data to other companies pharmacies manufacturers to distribute medicines cough cold products right to the retailers show hasn't this genius sell a product that collects data that you can then sell and make even more money we should have thought about this\n[noise] I ride I mentioned this before but now we
