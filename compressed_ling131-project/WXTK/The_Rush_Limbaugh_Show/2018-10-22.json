{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Markets are still ... and we want to keep you informed get our weekly market ... by becoming a member of berries brigade visit financially string showed dot com and signed up today\n[noise]\nTime to talk of cars and we're joined now by Antwon Goodwin from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty ninth ... Toyota Avalon Anton thanks for joining us today\nHey how's it going we're doing well so I took a look at the apple and just because I always liked to you know look at the cars before we talk about him\nMy first question is what happened to the front of this car because it kind of looks like a giant mouse driving down the road facing right at you what's what's your thought on the styling or well the\nEvelyn front end is ridiculously aggressive this year I think that's the way it is making some large steps to kind of get away from the boring brand that sort of beige reputation that it had and it might have gone a tad far on the Avalon if he if you look at it from the side from the rear maybe even from certain angles\nAnd kind of see what they're going for with the aggressiveness but no one that I Know I really think that it worked out well for them\nSo let's get past kind of what the front end looks like a let's go first under the hood ... what what kind of engine do we have what what are we work with in terms of power there\nYou've got a couple of options are the main option for most people is going to be a three hundred horse Howard of effects engine that actually feels really good in this car\nIs going to be made it with a pretty smooth automatic transmission but if you are the kind of person who wants to really get fuel economy and you don't really care about having three hundred horse power you could step down to about a two hundred horsepower\nA hybrid version and that's going to get you around forty three forty four miles per gallon so if you're concerned with like a mood comfortable right go hybrid if you're looking for something more power\nOr for passing the veep stakes is definitely a solid option\nWhat about when when you get inside of this the Avalon is is you know Toyotas luxury cars that they make how close does it get to their brand elections in terms of overall quality and in the comfort that you can get from this\nWilliam theory is actually my favorite part of the Avalon um especially in the limited trend where they've got really nice leather really nice details like stitching and stuff like that uh\nThe interior the Avalon in my opinion a is about as good as what you're getting a Lexus yeah and so it kind of makes it a little bit of a toss up between whether you want to pay more for the Lakers ticket\nSlightly better fit and finish a or if you're really happy with what I Would argue able to be called a very luxurious inferior and Avalon just got most of the building with that you can expect from Alexis there something comparable but for a little less money\nWhat stands out as far as bells and whistles there anything in particular that stands out as far as uh the technology that's available in this car\nWell the Avalon makes the Toyota steak instance we standard though you're adaptive cruise\nControl your link keeping hearing is this your life by monitoring all of that standard teachers for twenty nine the model year so you don't have to pay extra\nTo get any of those things anymore where some of the competition you have to check on like a few thousand dollar a safety package to get something like that so out of the box he's got pretty much everything that you could want as far as a driver aid and comfort technology for long highway cruises are slugging through traffic\nUm and the only thing that you'd really have to pay more for then would be nice or things like ... ...\n... what are we looking at in terms of cost on the Avalon where do you start in how how can you end up\nThat's what I'm thirty five for the based model which again still comes with\nAll of that safety technology and is still a really nice looking car on the inside at the very least a top of the line you're looking around forty three depending on whether you go to the stakes are high right there in about this thing\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's hadn't been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nBlaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff\nTalk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want to laugh so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republican\nGas

bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow is it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report\nAnything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind wouldn't want this\nWho when their right mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this and wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that\nWhy\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this and they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting and one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nThey're being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed\nA bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting ends allowing may as well just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense\nTo support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't ... for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThe method provide the rock solid math foundation

show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people\nWorked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it ah in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces their way and I know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou would dare you you he may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this is it about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms it's a joke folks that the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian\nCommunists think always trying to get in an invasion either\nWay you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's on military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and\nEverybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump since a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but on the line get them on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot\nOf different ways\nWill be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it was off\nTo Russia and by be Mitt work\nVoters have a choice on election day liberals

more toss up up for grabs as Republicans strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised that Dr ... and their polling analysts that I'm here to tell you again I don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings have I mean you can you know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters\nIt just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican they could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it\nAnd then nine months later changed their minds but this is what they ask us to believe\nAnd that's why I Do this polling nine months out eight months out which doesn't mean anything other than a you know interesting talking points at the time [noise] so still lots to get to as the program on falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with

a rag getting\nGrowing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on the a P story a ragged growing army of migrants\nYeah even change the headline to replace the word army with caravan\nWell that's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army might away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicles are on a flatbed trucks there in ... whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny\nI've seen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this but I [noise] seven thousand dollars a person's\nEyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates this this is costing upwards of twenty million dollars\nAnd I don't know about that\nBut I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so the Democrat donors have that kinda money some of them are walking a lot of them are walking\nAnd now there's a

Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie\nTo the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these\nKinds of Bradley's these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed the turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in\nLouisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move\nDoesn't say anything the other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by this guy's making a spectacle and I watched them talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a shame that we lost of loyalty and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call it lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob\nThat is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe

story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not enough people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now Bible showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of Santa's last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I\nI Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way a would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as the collective that's communist language she was talking about Florida as\nLaw or a collective he hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy because of what he will do in wrecking\nA growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants to government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but\nThe Santa would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing any extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats\nI Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump to support it because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote democratic\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else\nIs going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy\nContent on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity
