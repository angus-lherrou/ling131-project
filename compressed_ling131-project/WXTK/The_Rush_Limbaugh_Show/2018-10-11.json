is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things uh Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guy he's winding dined

nonsense he's saying on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same knocked it and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working\nThe rats lying\nYep threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discouraging us enough to make it not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time

today is way worse than I Would ever have imagined\nDuring a live phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that to this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't wanna jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry\nUh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I used to talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little lead other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by as we had it on a great control I don't think really\nThe very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when they're dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you you better be careful what he's we're discussing ... is a very dangerous day for older what has held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is he's got some problems\nNot used to be intelligent like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans a whimper away or not even acknowledge or are they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder renting but but but much ... totally totally uncalled for and we we were kingly unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of the song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people look run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly take\nA bit of a financial hit\nTo their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling data people\nObviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms\nAnd so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm\nPaying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed that to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing\nThe Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going\nGreat my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so threatening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing\nWhat Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully just slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump run the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but no\nIn a day no way\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are as many financial institutions and not going to produce strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it they said there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down\nThat is actually that is I'm very that that you're you're ... you're as soon as you as a ... a ... is his

[noise]\n\nThe bumper here for a while to sort of kick him here in a minute\nWe go to the\nYou\nGot [noise] given the buffer of the [noise]\n\nNew York magazine and look at it as Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results is this not hilarious looking back which lets retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir\nAnd the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes in we counted the boats\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nDoes your knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nI didn't believe in saying this this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate was Clinton on October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical\nQuestion what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results so\nThis is not funny looking like there are hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and ... rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions rich by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions\nConfirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're gonna use your last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to\nValidate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame rush and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nStory New York magazine they think they're doing an edible here and they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that\nThere was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome ended up happening to the benefit of Hillary Clinton [noise] somebody some of the story over the Robert Mueller he may not find out about\nAnd that starving story again
