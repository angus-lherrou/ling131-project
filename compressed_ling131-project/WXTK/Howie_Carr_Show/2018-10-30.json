being in prison for the rest of his life I I'm happy I'm happy about that\nYeah because he also I think nowadays we don't know when people especially that max security like he's a big time player and the president you know what I mean like they have to make sure they're probably a lot of people watching him at once\nSo we don't know how comfortable their life as you know sometimes you have like a serial killer they could be living a pretty comfortable life in prison so I'm sure some of the families feel relieved that now he's just officially\nYet yeah well I mean it's it has something to do with just the fact that you know some of the people were killed have been dead for like\nForty plus years you know I mean he he lived all this time after after killing these people at the end he got away with it for so long and and he ... and you know people who came after we look at the look at the former ah a colonel in the state police lieutenant colonel a Jack o Donovan\nMean jacko Donovan was totally honest cops\nAnd he's the one who went after Whitey and try to uh put in and actually did put the bugs in the garage in the west in uh Boston Lancaster straight\nAnd a ... and in return

how could anyone get away with that nowadays you couldn't get to the phones and all that\nBut really if you have the cops and you're ... you can get away with a lot you know what I mean like if the people who make the lies or or who enforce collide are ... using you on both then you're dead that's why he got away with that wasn't there wasn't evidence or anything I was just because he had enough people and if that\nSee that's why I said this in the morning minute to you know which is I mean it was bad enough that he corrupted the cops but then\nThe honest cops he he punish them he tried to

reconsider\nThere is not the investigation but he's conducting is investigation of crimes that didn't exist they would still claim he was obstructing the investigation of nothing is could this possibly be true Joe\nThat is exactly what happened I can tell you on authority for members of Congress that I've spoken with that that is precisely what happened I Want you to go back and remember this is this is relating back to what happened in New York after the election\nRemember when president elect Trump was briefed\nBy the intelligence community ah right after he was elected and then they all agree that they would all leave the room and James Comey would give him a special briefing and that's the way home they told him about the salacious details in the ... right about the hotel in Moscow\nThat was a decision made by all the heads of the intelligence community that Komen was going to go in there and basically shake down the president and extort him into shutting up what Rod Rosenstein did the other day is exactly the same thing\nHe started the president of the United states is backing down from de classification by telling him in essence if you'd think if you order this the classification now I can guarantee you\nAt the end and this is the way Rosenstein would do it because he's such a ... ball\nMr President I wouldn't recommend is but I Know that Mr Mahler is going to say that by de classifying you obstructed his investigation and he will include that\nIn some report about what you should be impeached for that is precisely what happened I was told that by a member of the committee that her testimony or not about this specific thing what about other things but this is what I've been told by people who are familiar with the back off\nOn the on the decision to declassify\nThe documents for a while I don't know I'd special ... what really bothers\nMe about this is how can you obstruct an investigation of a crime but didn't occur\nWhat you can't you can't and and and in fact what's going on here is\nThe president has been given advice or by people around him look don't push the envelope there's this thing is over\nDon't cause a stink these things will be declassified later or it's not going to have any impact on the election don't get yourself and unnecessary trouble here just just wait wait Mr President and the hunting by giving this the Mike\nMichael Horowitz the inspector general and say he can declassify these things while he's invest the guy's a investigating the abuses of the Pfizer warrant this is this is an amazing scenario that you were watching and if it weren't for everything else going on in the world\nThe horrible things that happened in Pittsburgh and the the nutty non bomber and\nThe elections this would be

I don't think any of it is true but ... is trying to make himself look like a victim\nWhoa whoa how but but I mean this is outrageous to try to shake down a president of the United states especially ... what do you didn't do it and\nIt it it worked remember it worked they shut it down once before and if it hadn't been for Admiral Mike Rogers who went and visited him\nIn the tower on November seventh season sit by the way all that stuff you were told by Khomeini and all those people it's all the result of illegal activity by the FBI and some contractors remember remember this is really important\nOn November the seventeenth Mike Rogers the head of an essay went to visit the president without the knowledge of anybody in the administration including the president of the United states for Iraq Obama and told him\nThat his campaign had been spied upon even told him by the way that there was an agent inside the campaign at that very moment right\nThat it was someone who was in the offices who was in fact an informant for the FBI we now know who that person was by the way they ... it's been discovered ... ah I have to be very careful here because even though\nIt's not a crime to do with this person was doing if they were asked to do so by the FBI it is so significantly embarrassing that uh before I can from it I can tell you this it's someone that everybody listening would know\nThat he would not be unknown to the American people\nIs he is he in in a kind of leave and you know for me for all the special counsel is\nOh let me just tell you I don't think he's in criminal legal jeopardy because he was acting under authority of the FBI and coal me but here's but here's his jeopardy it's the Carter page lawsuit that can make him a very poor man\nYou know I Begin to see as I as I see this thing on an unraveling before my very eyes and everybody else does begin to see more about what you're saying about the Carter page lawsuit appears to be a a\n... a a a more likely way that we are going to get to the bottom of this than than certainly the inspector general's report who's I mean he's he's ... he's moving lower than cold molasses drove the job as well\n... well he's purposely trying to avoid doing anything before the election I mean and and I you know I I you know I think Michael are which is a nice guy and all that and I'm sure he's not a partisan but when he decided\nThat he could not conclude\nThat a ... at that prosecution decisions were influenced by the bias of the FBI agents that none of the uh the OJ lawyers were influenced by that I said that's bull BS excuse me I almost did a bad thing that's total BS that was a punt on his part\nTo protect people so I I'm not sure that Michael Horowitz is as independent as he might look in the sense that I think\nYou know he he may have stayed too long at the fair or inside the\nDarn thing goes to show how you Joe do you think that the Donald Trump ... Rosen steam or not\nOf course not oh God no this is all of this is all it is this is all an act the president is is trolling Rosenstein he's trolling him he's trying to make it look using Rosenstein because he wants to he wants to get the lowest thing over with I\nHave no idea when the ... thing is going to end but it's it's fairly obvious that this whole exercise by Mueller has been an absolute joke\nIt's a cut it into you know within and I know I I don't mean that I like the spirit the theorists but it it looks like it's less of an investigation and more of an attempt to cover up I mean this gives them a a\n... year old to hold over the president's head to prevent him from getting the bottom of this\nWell no the ... and the reason all of your instincts are correct tally is just look at it Rod Rosenstein signed the last extension of the Pfizer weren't on Carter Page he signed the memo recommending that combing the fire\nHe appoints smaller the day after Mueller is interview to the FBI Director and he doesn't get it I mean when you go back and you look at the history of how all this started it is not a conspiratorial crazy ideas the truth is\nThat is if I'm a former United States attorney I look at that I look at these facts in a in a crescendo\nRight and they've also got a they've also got to change these uh these Koch of made me laws on a refugee status in asylum status edge it's become a a giant skiing out and I'm Glad that the president of the United states is a is is\nAt least beginning to make the move to end these immigration refs that are recognized the

Center for Immigration Studies Jessica thanks for being with us here on the highway car show\nGood to talk with you\nSo is there going to be a problem here uh you know I think Paul Ryan the outgoing house speakers are claiming but he doesn't think that President Trump has the right to uh do away with birthright citizenship on an executive order what the what are your thoughts on that\nOh Paul Ryan the constitutional scholar [laughter]\nThis is the point [noise]\nThis has been basically a bar stool discussion among you know immigration walks for\nPractically the whole twenty five or so years that I've been involved in this issue you know Ken anything be done about does the constitution really the fourteenth amendment really require us to offer citizenship to children of illegal aliens because there's this place there that nobody really understands the meaning of that says\nYou are if their birthright citizenship to aliens\nSubject to the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and everybody debates with this really means and how it could be changed it possible no one knows what the president is doing is he's going to\nJumpstart real action on this to get clarification so we can find out if it can be done or not and many people believe that\nThe constant the fourteenth amendment has been misinterpreted to require us to issue birth certificates passports to not only illegal aliens but\nChildren a first tourists\nAnd anyone born on our soil and I think it's a great idea to get this going create a case of course you know if he writes an executive order on that there's going to be an immediate lawsuit right and then it'll go before the courts and they can decide\nOr just like there was a ... maybe a lawsuit on the ... of these so called the Muslim ban which were really wasn't a Muslim ban but the you know ultimately I didn't take all that long for the Supreme Court to upheld or uphold his right to to ensure that travel ban right\nThat's exactly right and and so now instead you know we can all get off our bar stool and make legal arguments instead of just you know arguing about it and it's a real problem\nIs more than three hundred thousand babies born to illegal aliens in our country every year and there are tens of thousands of birth tourism\nCitizenship created all the time they go back to their countries they you know they they're kids may or may not ever come to live in the United states they may join ISIS\nThey may uh you know come here for school and then they have kids who maybe have no ties to the United states plus as you mentioned in the ticket\nTo qualifying for welfare benefits in the United states if you're illegal alien parents you have a kid here all of a sudden the kid get Medicaid you get public housing money get access to food stamps\nAnd all kinds of you know I I remember program\nYeah I remember reading about this uh you know thirty thirty five years ago they were saying that you know a ... women are teenagers we get pregnant in Mexico and then they would somehow get across the border into Texas when there were eight or eight and a half months pregnant give birth to a kid and then they'd never have to work together day in their lives that that'd be all set up with this\nAnd I thought it was just the you know a handful of people doing this but it's like you say it's it's not a handful it's hundreds of thousands a year\nOr doing this tell us about the as a birthday Taurus I'm you know again a lot of people don't don't read the newspapers as carefully as they used to they may not know about this uh this amazing scam but it's going on with ah people flying into the country to give birth\nYes it's a big thing with a Chinese with Russians Turks\nLebanese Koreans they there are businesses set up to ... where women have to come here for a couple of months have a baby they ... they stay long enough for the state department to process their babies passport application\nAnd then they go home with a U.S citizen child and that child can come back anytime and go to school here or you know live here and sponsor the parents for ... for a green card and ultimately citizenship later in life\nNot all of them do you come back what many people don't realize is if if they never come back\nThat birth tourism baby gets to pass on US citizenship to their kids\nAnd then we're responsible for the citizens overseas I had a friend who was a consular officer in Lebanon and said you would not believe all the people here and carry us passports\nAnd they're pretty sketchy involved in you know terrorist organizations and so on they don't love America they just want the court and there was this case recently in uh queens about this\nSure maybe it's overkill maybe you don't need to be ready for every worst case scenario but that's what makes simply saves home security systems so great it is always ready\nSimply say could cost an arm and a leg but it doesn't instead they only charge you what's fair

Whitey Bulger's partners to admit that he was involved in\nUpwards of fifty to sixty murders fifty to sixty so\nCorrupt this is a ... it's pretty amazing that and why the\nWay it is amazing why now you know looking at this is exactly how white it bothers should have gone out it is it's\nA that's a lot of money now we don't have to keep them alive on life support in federal prison\nYeah what do you live here\nThis is what he always feared was that he would be ah he he would be a discovered is a rat and uh and he would be wiped out by his uh his gang land associates and uh you know what's better late than never in my opinion\nOn whether you on that one hour ago and I mean this is a guy who deserved exactly what he got the only thing that would have been better it is that it got so did I and his kids can get the cats is that perhaps the and I'm Steve is just a ...\nAnd ... and a and Billy Johnson and but the two ... that he killed who by the way it happened to be brothers in law of of ah his girlfriend Catherine Greg how weird is that you know uh and\nThen Brian ... who is just something look but wanted to get out of some trouble and uh they ... you know they're corrupt can alert gave him up and then like Donny who died and the results I mean that's the body after buddy up the body and these people right away to get his eyes gouged out I think it's a gesture toward\nAn and people like a Bucky Barrett I mean ... beaten to death is just a burglar they just want to steal some money from him and his sons\nEnd up killing themselves you know I mean they the the the death toll it goes down beyond the people they actually killed two generations of of people's lives destroyed devastated by you know losing their raw losing their relatives male and female alike\nAnd and this and and I was about all the why why why he doesn't get\nHe killed uh the uh the the Nepal upon all brothers he killed all these people\nAnd kill the O'Brien's\nPeople like Rob banks with he was just he was a he was just the the worst human being he ruin so many lives with a cocaine et cetera et cetera okay I Am leaving right now you can see me tonight in about a\nLittle over an hour with Martha my column on Fox News channel read my column tomorrow Steven grace are going to take over thanks VIPs for coming in Maui car [noise]\nAnd they\n\nWith the three around\nFeaturing\nBy\nWay I mean for only three thirty nine nine thirty twenty nine Ninety down for a New England di San\nStock market volatility make you scared like nervous while I'm steady panicking started praying Comey highly me damn good then thirty five financial planning TPA for workshop and financial planning on November sixteenth any down for details call one eight hundred ticks down in sixty five hundred that's one eight hundred six hundred and fifty five\nHundred and remember don't panic plan\nSecurity offered to help you out financial number ... ... and that many bite off into advisory group Alfie a registered indefinitely by their separate from al ... financial ... local news\nGood evening I'm Doug Bernie with this nobody likes to can't news update voters and province town said yes to six million dollars sewer expansion and to land bank purchases at a special town meeting on Monday Night\nOfficials will seek a federal grant of two million dollars and borrow the remaining four million for the project which is expected to increase the town's wastewater capacity by Fifteen Percent or one hundred and fifty five thousand gallons a day\nVoters also approved vending one million dollars just for a ... acre parcel of land near Bradford street known as the wire property to preserve the land is green space at one point four million dollars for a parcel of land along commercials street to be returned rather turned into a park\nVice president Mike Pence is supporting President Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship\nTrump is going to do so with an executive order pet says it's unclear if the fourteenth amendment applies to children of parents who are in the U.S illegally if Trump follows through he said he'd be stirring up a huge legal battle\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of trying to create a diversion the head of the mid term elections next week\nNBC ten Boston early warning mother calling for a clear night tonight with a lower I'm thirty four for Wednesday's sunny with wind you're fifty eight right now it's forty seven in Hyannis I'm Doug Bernie news radio Ninety five WICK we'll check keep good traffic coming up TK\nForeign and sad to more bridges are clear where it takes now major delays reported from is that the more down Cape to Arlene's ... no major delays or put it back up to the sad to more an hour at their trouble free en route twenty eight nothing in your way both ways between found that than the barn rotary\nIt's not exactly a soap opera round here is pretty darn\nUses radio Ninety five ...

now he's executive producer filling in for him he's\nHe's he's taken a slide on his own show to go beyond Fox News and and try and sell some books as the it's the most how we thing ever to leave your show for another [laughter] but he's pretty much been doing it all day during the commercial breaks he's been flipping out into the hallways to do interviews with the various TV personalities and you know his\nHis daughter texted me earlier and said hey can you can you tell me what TV programs how he's going to be on today so I can watch them and I said uh all of them\nAre so if you're if you're looking to have a little bit more highly car and your life tuned in to Fox News with Martha my column today at seven thirty seven thirty five around that area he'll be talking about the ... the late James Whitey Bolger\nAnd I know we've been talking about um all day and if you want to call in and you want to you know ... take a a victory dance so uh over the dead da da da da da Silva ... money for four or five hundred and forty to forty two\nBut I wanted to touch on a piece that you know this is this is I think a a feel good piece\nA that will give you a maybe a little bit of ... of hope for the Democratic republic we have here and this is a New Yorker magazine and it's called twelve young people on why they probably won't vote and it's just about one of the funniest things that I've read all day and it\nUh I have to say a number of these people are from Massachusetts but that should not be a surprise that some of these confused young people who don't know whether or not they're going to vote this year for Massachusetts but so they they in their own words are described to this a New Yorker journalist or I guess there's a couple of them why they're not voting and I just wanted to read a little bit of these and again this is a\nA young people speaking with the New Yorker magazine about why they're probably not going to vote and you know if we'd had more time to repair disgraced this would have been excellent masterpiece theater how we might have to have you read a couple of these uh\nAfter the break out but this is Samantha age twenty two from old bridge New Jersey she last voted in twenty sixteen\n[noise] going into the election I was so proud to be in this country at this moment so proud to be voting for Hillary Clinton I had my Clinton sweat shirt on all day I was on Twitter telling people that if they didn't go out and vote they were dead to me like the whole thing my face and the whole system was crushed pretty quickly\nBut there's still a lot of powerful people especially in the Democratic party that are centrists and that's just a little frustrating when it comes time to stand up to this president and the policies he's trying to pass like the Kavanaugh saying I get there the minority and then it was an uphill battle but I just feel like there wasn't a big enough fight put up to that\nSo as a as Samantha age twenty two of old bridge in New Jersey She feels like there are too many centrists and the Democrat Party really where all this interest in the Democratic party because I haven't found them and they didn't put up a tough enough fight against Kavanaugh\nI mean they had Michael Evan cook up gang rape allegations they they were they were submitting into the Senate record an allegation from Julie sweat neck\nThat he he was running train frequently on like ten occasions that's not fighting hard enough Samantha what else should they have done should they have like physically physically killed Brett Kavanaugh 'cause that's just about the next step that's a that's a next step that they could if they can to prevent them from being on the Supreme Court\nAh and then she goes on full disclosure I have a ballot sitting at home and twenty sixteen I voted absentee and I just marked off send me a a mail in ballot for every election I don't really get that argument that it's really hard like it's not that hard\nShe's still a lot a uncertain whether or not she's going to vote or the next one is\nA wreath age twenty three from Hudson, Ohio has never voted twenty three years old has never voted\nI'm not sure whether race is a guy name or a girl named uh he says he says she says I never felt certain enough to vote but I'm a political science student and the talk of voting is really big in my circle of friends and twenty sixteen I almost did of course\nI'm not a big fan of Trump but I didn't know if Trump was going to be a flash in the pan or I just didn't know what to do I didn't want to help something that might end up being wrong\nSo it's a very good portrait of a millennial voters just completely wracked with indecision and again this is the reason why I say this is the feel good story of the day is because these people probably aren't voting and you know I'm of a mind that the fewer people we have voting the better off we all are especially these idiots like what MTV comes out and does this rock the vote campaign\nLike I don't want the lowest common denominator voting like just like\nTen or Fifteen Percent of the country was voting I feel like it would be a lot better off but I Know that that would be like an elitist attitude but you know I don't care it's true\nOr so this again is ... I was particularly interested in voting and twenty sixteen because Donald Trump is so stupid it drove me up a wall he knew way less about government that I Do\nThis is the this is the twenty three year old ... student who's never voted before says he he knows a lot more about government than the current president United States he goes on\nI have ADHD it makes it hard for me to do certain tasks or the payoff is far off in the future abstract\nI don't find it intrinsically motivational the amount of work logically isn't that much filled form mail it go to a specific place on the specific day but those kinds of tasks can be hard for me to do if I'm not enthusiastic about it that's kind of a problem with social attitudes around you know it's your civic duty to vote\nI once told a co worker I didn't vote and she said that's really irresponsible in this judgmental voice you can't build policy around calling people irresponsible\nYou need to make people enthusiastic and engaged I mean you can tell he has ADHD definitely not lied about that he just jumped around in his explanation judgmental co workers are going to make them vote\nAnd he goes on the motivation is about the actual value my vote has it's more like a theoretical signaling value if that's the case I Would rather signal that Democrats should have more progressive candidates rather than assuming that everyone in the left will automatically vote for the candidates to run\nSo it was a racist sending a message to the Democrat Party that they need to be more progressive by a not voting for Democrats\nGood it let me let me know that turns out raise\nAll right this is another good one this is Megan aged twenty nine from San Francisco a last voted in two thousand fourteen [noise]", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "30"}
