we are short Halloween so I Want to we wanted to do a little more Whitey stuff that I Will do other stuff obviously as well and uh but I but I Do want to read that there are more Whitey stories to to share with you today and\nI'm going to tell you a Halloween story from from Whitey Bolger was this was probably about\nI don't know how close the thirty year maybe more than Thirty years ago now was in the Nineteen eighties\nThey were burying bodies at a at at this house I think it was on the east third straight\nAnd I was ... it was owned by one of the brothers of a gang member and they the the brother didn't know that they were burying the bodies in the house but I but they were in the basement\nAnd so he decided to sell the house so this is when a white and Steve you were making like a million bucks\nWhen the Jo Marie would bring in a load of marijuana boatload of marijuana into Boston Harbor\nSo they are so this guy decides to sell the house and instead of instead of the spring and for like probably a hundred thousand two hundred thousand maybe I don't pops three hundred thousand to buy the house even though they got even though their role in cash they say no we're not going to spend the money we don't need that house\nSo they they said we're going to dig up the bodies and move the body's power straight for the the parking lot it's not a parking lot anymore but it used to be a parking lot across the street from a Florian hall and so they told the\nKevin Weeks and pat needed they got they got the bodies and you don't want you know how Bones Are you know after a while you know change when you think of chicken bones or something you know you got all these little bones that come apart to say I hate to say I hate to be so\nWant but it's it's the same with human bones you got all these little bones they fall apart\nUp a little bones in your ear to I I don't know where they're just\nAll over the place but anyway so they they make a week's and are in need they've got these bodies and they're having to sift through the dirt what can through looking for the little bones to make sure they get all the bones before they moved the bodies so they they dig up all the ... they dig up to three bodies and uh they put them in bags\nAnd then they tell me to get lost 'cause they don't trust me they think ... they don't want 'em knowing where the bodies are\nSo white he's already dug a big hole that they're going to bury a mint on on ... street in Dorchester and so he goes they go down there and it's dark and it's Halloween and so they give they give Kevin Weeks AKA Kevin squeaks ... eight two weeks at a machine gun and they say you ... that you stand here and guard that make\nSure nothing happens while we're ah we're\nRe entering these bones of our victims and so this guy pulls up in a car you know the you know Halloween everybody's going to\nIt was right to drink and everything it's night time so this guy pulls up and he's just got to take a leak so he he gets out of the car and they all fall to the ground and you know Whitey and Steve you're in the hall and or weeks is up closer to the street and the guy comes it gets out of his car relieves himself and it gets back in the car\nAnd drives away the Whitey jumps up after the guys gone\nAnd runs\nTo weeks wraps the gun starts yelling at\nWhy didn't you show them we had plenty of climate not hall\n\nThat's my that's my trick or treat story to begin\nThe show by the way you're going to keep your lights off a tonight as for how we cart Halloween tradition\nNo I keep the lights on and they

talk about the debate last night I just did a great job and I thought this was the most we saw lives Warren kind of put back on our heels especially when the moderator\nShe's such a dope she really is she can't think on our feet I haven't seen anything like it for a long time\nBut you know what I should she should be the disadvantage debating most state reps\nWithout a doubt right watching it tried to debate Donald Trump the [laughter] last night watching when Mike Tyson box of Ninety year old that\nThe kind of her and just talking about the illegal fundraising is a pretty long cut but let's just play and see how far we get pretty good\nAnd one of the thing that really we found out recently I think is pretty unconscionable is the fact that Senator Warren\nWas fundraising illegally using the vote on justice Kevin on the confirmation vote to try to raise money for her campaign that just came out\nYou know is that something that you should not be doing first of all when we were having a national discussion about the Supreme Court trying to fundraise off it but he did and it turns out it's illegal [noise]\nCan I say no go ahead please yeah question here I I hear Mr tales a statement about how wrong it was the way that Dr foreign was traded but I don't remember Mr tail speaking up when Donald Trump made fun of her [laughter] I don't remember Mr Taylor\nThat and that's representative ... yeah I Know he's calling her Senator Warren is an e and she's calling the Mr deal I mean you know how how a condescending could she be\nThe funny thing is though that the moderator thought she was going to respond to the accusations so he went of course of course like you can read about that\nBecause you know they just accuse you of doing something illegal and in centuries pretend that he didn't say it doesn't offer and that's a really good definition of lives Warren like doesn't have to offer any explanation doesn't have to\nPeople's does it have any explanation right and doesn't care and just expect everyone to go along and then the moderator had to stay at the end\nAh actually we'd really like to know about that and she's like oh I I\nI I don't know I don't know I had no idea\nYeah she ... she doesn't know the complaint has been filed against or I mean it was on the Internet it was in every newspaper she didn't see that any of that no she didn't she claimed cheated\nGuys this segment is powered by the Whitey gadget that show it going fast so get your book now we haven't seen how eat this happy since I Would say probably since Trump won the election you've really been floating\nWhitey he's dead I'm going to ride on the I I'm not personally inscribed every book are we doing my auto ... white he's dead exclamation point ten thirty Eighteen right at the top\nThere at the collectors item for sure don't let this historic moment go by without having that and um I think quickly Steve if we could just play um [noise] let's play the ... eight\nWhen Donald Trump preferred country like Haiti in El Salvador Africa\nRepresented deal ... on you or to test with Donald Trump the baby because you're fixated on the White House [noise]\nLet me tell you what is costing disgusting is\nProtesting down in Washington arm in arm with Linda sauce for a noted anti Semite anti American and prosciutto ... advocate that is not leadership down in Washington\nGood I'm Glad he brought up a ... what is it what it was a ... law say about gay people killed them that's what it says and and uh in Warren is campaigning with a woman who supports your real off shame on you senator\nYou don't know about you compared to solve season much season a black flies season the election season seems to be more caustic more messy and even more invasive to your eyes and ears and what we hear it matches brothers may pay some attention to these annoying creatures we don't let them into was one bit believe me on this instead we focus on things like our favorite model\nWhich is confident organizations very frequently and gender fantastic even or group therapy for short this motor reminds us that passion combined with no combined with the more usually produces it does it get incredible amazing results you know ... therapy\nMost recently the spirit of good therapies for those with gender yet another fantastic event in the long line of fantastic events that

governor down at mar a Lago a couple of years ago when he was a stopping mine\nWhen he was stopping by\nAnyway aid for four or five hundred a forty to forty\nTwo um [noise] the uh the the main story though I think is still ... other than a Whitey Bolger you know which is again a big story they've they they've identified the suspect in the slaying of Whitey Bolger\nHe's a a he's a mobster a sort of a low level mobster from Springfield, Massachusetts not the kind of person you'd you'd think would do something like this I've uh I I ... I keep up with the Springfield mob\nJust just by reading the uh the local newspaper in the court filings and I heard of this guy but I Would never in a million years of thought that he would take it upon himself to kill Whitey Bolger but he's doing life without parole so I guess he had nothing to lose this makes a big shot\nAnd I just said I'm doing I I've been doing a rabbit uh uh ask me anything are\nA threat all day and uh I said\nThis I think this makes this guy's name is Freddie I ... I think this makes him the biggest Greek and organized crime since gossip Alex who was a big a\nBig shot in the fat in Chicago\nBack in the day came I came out of them out of a late thirties he was doing hits and then he just sort of rose through the ranks and I think he's been dead for a while now but he was a he was a big shot\nAnd uh I guess he's the he's about the skinny ... used to work for Jerry Andrew Lo here in Boston but he was never he was never much of a a a a contender shall we say anyway this guy is I guess if you want to call them that ate what talk more about why\nThe ah later on and it it is Halloween wanna Whitey ... favorite holidays is when he liked to move bodies around a when ... when he was moving them out of sellers about the public land\nBut anyway I think the big story here today once again is the is the is the gravy train that is rolling north and as he had to as it gets closer and closer and is it it seems to be having a a\nA devastating effect on the Democratic prospects in the\nUpcoming midterm elections the or the mainstream media is becoming more and more hysterical about how they they're claiming that either the caravan doesn't exist literally doesn't exist or it's just a a\nA handful of people or that it's just women and children now if you've seen them do also it's so far away that it doesn't really matter right\n[laughter]\nWe don't want to comment gets within like two million miles of earth they have these uh hysterical reports on the on the network newscast saying but the you know the comedy is good this is the closest the common has come to the to the earth in a in a half a million years or something like that\nBut the but this caravan is a a thousand miles away the gravy train of a welfare would be welfare recipients in that that's that's okay no we're not going to worry about it\nBut you've seen that you've seen the pictures are the interviews actually one guy has been convicted of attempted murder and I don't know if he fled or did this time but he wants to come back to the United states and get a part\nThat's great that's\nWhere our we oh sure sure\nMeanwhile the ambassador to the U.S for Mexico a guy named ... Gutierrez is blasting\nDemocrats were saying everyone in the migrants caravan are are peaceful refugees seeking asylum yesterday ... explain there have been multiple instances where the migrants have

Latino and guess what they said stay there were super still to have the caravan come and undercut their wages are\nActually they put their playing out to switch their votes to Republicans because they're so concerned about the same things that oh I don't know white voters in Texas and elsewhere and black voters in Texas in elsewhere\nBizarre with the Democrats are told me that all Hispanics care about is illegal immigration\nI here's what one of the voters told us so this woman from ah MSNBC I Do believe that if somebody wants to live in the U.S they should go through the official process so as a result\nI tend to ally myself with people who agree with that in other words Americans in other words tax payers so the reporter said when you see images like the migrant caravan and President Trump talking about the caravan does that motivate you to want to vote in a certain way this is\nWhat's the tax the Texas a Mexican American said yes\nIt makes me want to vote Republican I think if you want to live in this country you need to abide by its laws\nThat one year micro aggressions from\nOh\nHate speech triggering so they they went back to the MSNBC hosted doesn't say a

I was glad that you brought up Linda socks or and I think a lot of people still forgotten this woman they only see her occasionally she appears at these rallies and\nTalks about ah you know we've got to a overcome Islamophobia and all this but why don't you tell people this this woman that appears at these rallies with a Elizabeth Warren what she's all about\nReligious our story is somebody who um you know comes from the middle east is I'm a believer a firm believer in sharia law which as I think many people know really subjugate swimming in a way that I don't think even Elizabeth Warren would say is right but for some reason she works\nMarches arm in arm with her at rallies or especially the one at the cabinet or in a anti Kevin our valley down to Washington but all interest stories probably one of the most noted anti Semite in\nThe United states she's anti American and here's Elizabeth Warren a happily sharing a microphone with her against Kavanaugh was just a few weeks ago um and she won't even acknowledge that she herself is aligned yourself with somebody who does not have American interests at heart and so I think you know with Elizabeth Warren it's so hypocritical she talks about\nUm the evils of the president and anybody associated with him and meanwhile she has courted with people that you know I don't think normally we would want to associate themselves with and and at the same time into the discussion of civility is out there as well and you know Senator Warren has talked about you know having\nScience a scientist or whatever doctors cut open you know a Republican body she's talked about how Republicans wants to lead me from the American people and they're trying to fix health care so you know getting a senator wind up what she does does what she says who she associates with very questionable but she doesn't want to balance that these debates\n... let's go back to shore real law for a moment doesn't it make a homosexuality a capital crime um you could be executed in countries that have ... you wouldn't gauging the homosexual activity\nI Believe I Believe that you can also of your hand dropped off for shoplifting to how does how does she says the among the Trump on your hands off for shoplifting or a part of a surreal law\nWell look she through due process and presumption of innocence out the window with Brett Kavanaugh so I suppose civil rights for her optional I mean I I I guess that must be the new philosophy for the Democrat or progressive wing of the Democratic party\nYou know did did you see how she will you obviously sought to being a kid can you believe how she she couldn't even answer the question you know you think she wouldn't be able to like a Bill Clinton tap dance around it when she gets called out on this uh this report of an ethics violation\nBut she just does the ... she can't she she can't even put together a coherent sentence let's\nListen a let's listen to the cuts you got it there Steve this is the ...\nOkay I Want the cut of uh her uh her talking about the um\nUh about uh the uh ...\nYeah the fund ... cut cut cut\nTo one of the thing that really we found out recently I think it's pretty unconscionable and the fact that senator one\nWas fundraising illegally using the vote on Kavanaugh the confirmation vote to try to raise money for her campaign that just came out\nYou know that's something that you cannot be doing first of all when we were having a national discussion about the Supreme Court is trying to find ways off it but you did and it turns out it illegal [noise]\nCan I have no go ahead please yeah question here I I hear tales a statement about how wrong it was the way that Dr foreign was treated but I don't remember Mr Dale speaking help when Donald Trump made fun of her [laughter]\nI don't remember Mr deal speaking out pointing Republican or actually ram running through the Kavanaugh nomination I I may have just missed it but I\nI don't remember I you know that's because they're in a war and I don't look for every opportunity to try to grandstand now I didn't want to call you responding to the mayor Somerville Somerville making a pretty negative statement this last week but the fact of the matter is\nThat was such an intense moment in our country's history as far as trying to deal\nWith presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our legal system and you were willing to throw it right out the window because you were part of the Senate Democrats who are trying to score political points by using poor Dr Ford testimony as a way to drag down a man without any corroborating evidence ...\nSo I don't think I quite understand the answer\nSo she could but then what happens is the uh\nI guess it's a ... at a Harding says what about those these ... these charges against you and then she starts doing the ...
