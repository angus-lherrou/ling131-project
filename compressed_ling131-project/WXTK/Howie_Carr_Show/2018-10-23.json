his really big line or is that everyone should remember how the recovery started and that was with the Obama administration\nAre so bad that we elect the Trump\nThat so in in in that sense he is\nThe father of the economic recovery well walked in office ten years ago\nWe were in the middle of the worst economic crisis in my lifetime that was the last time but the other party was in charge of
