of your stories of the year but we need to see the receipt we need to know how is this broken down was mostly drinks are mostly strippers will always\nSaid definitely mostly drinks I think\nThey said that they started out with like these four hundred and fifty dollar bottles of champagne which they thought was ... they were being caught but I'm I was doing the math like but I don't think they have a hundred thirty\nBottle no past what I'm saying it's going to be mostly strippers right and what if you can kind of justified because they're trying to get to take care of their mental health you know relax a little\nBit if you if you are spending money on stripper that's usually stop you have on hand you don't usually like charging like I Want to give that to pretend dollars targeted to my bill how would you do music videos when they make it rain um actually\nNo funny story of my parents were actually in London to visit my sister who's studying abroad and hanging out with the jaguars and know what they say they thought eagles fans everywhere and an eagles fan said to my dad I hate to tell you that the Tom Brady does he over for him and my dad was like yeah I Know right it really

[noise]\nThis reminds me of when you get a bottle of sparkling water and then they just assumed that for the rest of the night you want more bottles and you just really wanted a taste of the highlights life and you didn't want\nLike forty five dollars worth of sparkling water you have to let people know if you're giving them a little piece of champagne and then they keep drinking at you have to say by the way you're officially off our cat you're on your own so I'm kind of team jaguar on this one\nAnd my writing\nI still think the most of it was spent on strippers even at even at four hundred and fifty dollars a bottle there's no way you get up to sixty\nFive five ... and then they got the ... the bill and they tried to run out the door I mean I I just I Would love to you know see what the conversation was you know I mean there was a what we thought they were being caught or at least that's what they said yesterday after the game\nYou know there is a pre conversation to buy the the bar management there were like hey keep an eye on those guys they're running up a tab we think they're I Try and make or break for the door they looked fast\nYeah well when I was a way that you had a table that with you know spending a lot of money all night you're keeping your eyes on them like yeah I'm about to make bank so if I'm the person taking care of their little spot in the strip club and I see them heading towards the door on my oh hell no yeah I just spent five hours waiting on these guys and they're going to leave\nIt might be in a different country and I know we lost the

Duncan when the patriots when we're not really climbing light poles\nBe per se but he insists that sixty five thousand dollar bill rivals your tablet late great whiskey produced\nOn the tab great currently spending at a bar it's sixty five dollars minus the last three zeroes I'm also how did you hear about Angela Merkel\nYes she's gone she's going to sketch out to be gone but it takes three years to get rid of her as she stepping down to twenty Twenty one yeah I Know it's what the what takes so long that that's like I don't know fifty thousand migrants from now\nProbably more than that

station news radio Ninety five WMGK\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News around like stone the man accused of shooting and killing a ...\nThis isn't the daily mail from the u._k. oh that's great but it's also the judicial watch has said the same thing they had a a they had somebody embedded in there there's all kinds of a gang bangers in there I mean you you know the the the good news is some of them are only coming over here to go on welfare the bad news as some of them are coming over here\nTo be gang bangers and part of joined MS Thirteen\nPart of me thinks it's a mistake for conservatives to focus on the possible you know ISIS terrorists are MS Thirteen because\nEven if there it doesn't really matter whether there is or isn't terrorist in the group it's still bad they shouldn't be allowed to come into the country and it just kind of makes our arguments stronger I think but then they focus on well you can't prove that you can't prove that\nWell where are these diseases coming from by the way they we have all these new these are new old diseases the word or radical jaded from the U.S a half century or a century ago\nThey're now making a miraculous comeback now that now that we have all these illegal aliens from the third world coming into the country you have these ... these weird\nMutant polio type a maladies or are spreading again not to mention all the other a horrible things like a tuberculosis a whooping cough that theory or even leprosy is coming back\nAnd the odd thing is that the same liberals who are welcoming these people across the border are also refusing to vaccinate their children\nYeah I I Know it's a a Victor Davis Hanson has a\nGood column about this we're going to have I Am colds or on a later on today and and it had again I I Am I finished up the it's on Kennedy Babylon to pretty much and I have a I have a quote in there I did a chapter on that Ted Kennedy and an immigration and the immigration reform act of Nineteen sixty five and all the other a terrible law\nReforms that he was involved in that have that have led to this ah this ah for these hordes of a\nOf uh illegal aliens swarming into the country and uh you know the the the one quote that really stands out I looked it up again was a Milton Friedman he says you cannot have open borders when you have a welfare\nSociety and that's what we're proving right now because what you have is a people who don't want to work or coming in to the country and it's just it it's it's a recipe for catastrophe and the and and that's what we're getting\nThey did a poll in the union leader today somebody sent it to me the Manchester union leader and they said the do you what do you want the the the caravan to come into the U.S eighty five percent said no I Know what to self selecting a sample the union leader isn't this conservative papers that used to be New Hampshire isn't this conservative state but it's still eighty five\nPercent nobody who's a taxpayer I don't think wants this these people to come into the country\nI mean there there could be\nImmigration system has to be set up\nFor the benefit of the people who are already here in the country not for the benefit of everybody who wants to come in this is like you better watch your micro aggression from this is like you know having a resort somewhere and allowing people to come to the resort and stay forever for free I mean what what is the difference\nVictor Davis Hanson\nDo the migrants ever pause and wonder whether their own past and present at present attitude to the law in the abstract man some small part explain why their own countries in the concrete are often prone to lawlessness in other words why would a host country welcome in aliens who break the law and order to\nEnter it because of their own home is lawless\n\nIt is Orwellian to leave a nation because of its lawlessness and then first whether another country illegally and second to continue to reside in Contra invention of the loss\n[laughter] [noise]\nMost most of the migrants claim they have no intention of diverting their odyssey to another country only America\nWill do often Central American government's the Mexican elite wouldn't be illegal aliens in their sympathizers than the American progress about identity politics movements obsess on the supposed xenophobia racism that nativism and in hospitality of the United states\nSo what exactly is America the moniker defied why would anyone wish the editor such an ill the rope country so different from the customs and traditions of Central America\nWould not Mexico be much better place for a refuge or a refuge for the caravan people given multiple if entities of ethnicity language culture and history\nYeah\nI mean why do they want to come here and and and again they they keep then now they're marching with the flags of two of the U.S a\nLittle countries from Central America in front of them so if they if they if these countries are so terrible and there are oppressing them why are they why are they carrying their flags I I'm just I'm perplexed by this\nEight for four or five hundred a forty to forty two you know why can't we have people coming into this country we're actually going to contribute something to the country other than infectious diseases and ...\nYou know\nI mean I Know I Know not all of them are going to be

[noise]\nLive from them Matthews brothers [noise]\nA four for five hundred forty to forty two\n[noise] we have a [noise]\nOkay we were going to talk to the\nFor secretary of state was out in the Springfield today there's a a ... they call it a scandal or the or the there's a race for a register\nDeeds I mean that's that's what you call a ... I mean a minor office and the larger scheme of things for Hampton county register these was held by got him to ask for many many decades and he died and a ... a state\nRap Sheryl ... Rivera decided to get into the race against or a Republican woman who worked in the office for a number of years and so she got all these signatures in these ... and the signatures are are just\nApparently totally fraudulent there but a bunch of people have step forward and said that they are\nThat they didn't sign these petitions and some of them the signatures are ... are written out in block letters it's just it's it's ridiculous a so Anthony ... is the Republican candidate for ... for secretary of state and the secretary of state is that ... is the election cheap electrodes officer of the commonwealth\nAnd he's supposed to make the decision on whether or not these signatures are okay and and a ... a a\nAngel ... who's the Republican candidate she missed the opportunity to to complain she's filed a complaint now so but the deadline has passed but I had the more I went out there today to what to do was hold a press conference about this Anthony what's the what's the problem here with all these uh Cheryl Coakley Rivera signatures\nYou there\nNow we've got we've got a bad connection we're gonna have to get him back in a second here eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nOr Galvin a bill Galvin the or the secretary of state currently who's running for reelection his spokesman said that window closed months and months ago we're now counting ballots the candidate if the candidates alleging violations of elections law we're not in Fort Smith agency and we will refer the matter to the correct one such as the district attorney's office\nWe're the attorney general okay we got them back a Anthony what's the problem with the signatures thanks for being with us\nBut thank you how you know it's I I got a chance to see a number of them and they are are in my opinion they're blatantly ah just copy straight down a page you know numerous um people's names every individual name is different but the signatures are the same now the secretary of state's office told\nThe clerk's office you know we don't want you to you don't need to be Colombo\nAre investigating these but it I mentioned today inspector clue so could tell that these things are just a straight list of ... ... it's really shameless and it's a disservice to a ...\nAnd ... but it's too but he isn't it too late now to what to do anything\nWell that seems to be the the problem I mean I don't know if it's too late for the statute of limitations they as a crime to ah to falsify names on these documents say a year in prison than a thousand dollars for each instance so I don't know about the statute in terms of criminal\nActivity but in terms of filing a complaint it's too late but let me say highly that's the problem I mean you submit thousands of signatures for view on may thirtieth and you only have to kill a third or fourth to\nFile a complaint you didn't leave much time for her to um to get to the east or you know get them from the secretary's office to review them it's really an unfair situation for a Republican candidate\nYeah I mean I mean apparently a you know I was looking at the story in the U.S refill Republican in the ... and uh the the Republican number ... came out she found a lot of people\nWhose names were on the uh that were signed in and they didn't uh they they didn't sign it I mean it's it's you know it's ridiculous and number one and the other thing too is a lot of these you've seen them and now I haven't seen the actual ... petitions\nA lot of these are are ah written out enough block\nHand printed letter is not is not a real lot cursive signature right\nRight and there is all it appears to be the same pen have bother changing and the vaccine\nI shouldn't say handwriting it's basically printed names um and there doesn't seem to be a lot of concern about fraud from from the secretary of state's office or from the clerk's office just seems like a you know it's in comedy was incumbent upon the Republican candidate to figure this out ourselves I don't know how she was to do that\nYeah ... it it's a ... it's not that tough but you don't get I I've been involved in like state wide\nA signature gathering campaigns we have to get a you know Seventy thousand from all across the state and then you have to go back then the legislature voted down and you have to go out and get ten thousand more I mean I Know they're only in one county but all you got to get is a thousand signatures he can't be that tough to get a thousand signatures in Hampton county\n... well no I mean it it's it's not that ... that it will she did it ethically I mean these are from what I understand that could be could be hundreds of them better um ... and\nThere's nothing that she can do about it has nothing to be done about it and I think that uh our state secretary of state and that how clerk or I don't know if it's her fault they were told\nDon't investigate these too closely so I don't know what they were to do um it's really unfair for the Republican candidate it's shameful\nYeah the reason I the reason I'm interested in this case Anthony's I mean I've I've I've run into a ... out on the ah out on the on the west coast as Elizabeth Warren would call it of\nMad [laughter] but yeah you know if this is you\nKnow people are concerned about the voter fraud or as they are the Democrats like to call it voter suppression but you know they're it's it's not just the people you know being bus stop for Massachusetts the New Hampshire there's there's all kinds of different voter fraud isn't there and this is a this is an example of a
