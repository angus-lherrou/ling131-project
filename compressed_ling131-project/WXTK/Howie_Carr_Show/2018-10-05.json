local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believed that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard\nAnd it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign that didn't that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I CNN and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\n\nBut I have to keep
