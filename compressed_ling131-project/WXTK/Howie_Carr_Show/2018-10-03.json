I Would say any female should be concerned because ah you know what always happens when in the in these kinds of situations is\nThe original oppressor group they eventually the oppressors get tired of oppressing them and they move on to another group which will be females nobody safe in this kind of an environment this is this is these are this is\nMob a rule here or that that they're they're

WICK news breaks out we break in that when you watch the gay West Germany Cape Cod and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News\nIsland to love as the White House says President Trump wasn't mocking Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford during a rally last night\nOr the spawn melt in a very highly educated listener so I don't know if it had to go into detail about what a Brazilian waxes but it's\n... it's the removal of the hair around your your private parts how about we leave it at that\nThat sounds good as you've seen the complaint the German one and two specific details to what he\nMeant by Brazilian wax like I said it's it's very intimate so uh the the woman who owns a spa a declines to offer that service because they don't perform a service on a and this was clearly a man he goes into\nA lot of detail again in this five page handwritten complaint about the fact that he still has male genitalia 'em and watch them waxed and so she declined because they don't do this procedure for\nFor men to do it for women and that made her now a subject of a complaint filed attorney general's office because under this\nBathroom law which applies to all public accommodations\nThis man who identifies as a woman has been denied the service\nI ... I didn't write down and read that I Am really a reluctance to read very much of a complaint but I've been reluctant to tweet it out or to your or to put a link you know I Know it's it's just so so graphic\nAnd so hard but I can read the uh the the uh the get the page one here I Am a transgender woman being told by spa owner that I Am a man and therefore she will not provide same services to me because I Am a man and\nNot a woman but yet he says later on in the complaint or she says or whatever as says that ah that he still has male genitalia but he says he's a woman so he should be so the the the female or a\nWorker is at the spa should provide him with a Brazilian just like they would for a woman\nThat's right but that that is how this law works out is that the definition of gender identity in Massachusetts law is extremely broad and fake and it doesn't require surgery as in this case you there's no surgery doesn't require hormones that doctors a diagnosis it doesn't even require consistency\nSo he could walk into the place the next day and say I actually am a man a today\nI'm all requires as they sincerely held gender identity\nThat's it so to ripe for abuse and that's one of our real concerns about what this law\nYeah I told her this is this ... this is from the complaint I told her my body has started to change considerably colon my skin is soft they're a\nHormonal hair hairs do not grow back as fast and the hairs themselves have become softer and fine and my breasts are just starting to develop in my hips and what are changing too\nYeah so I think the males on is on estrogen but he's still again as intact male genitalia which the women at the spa do not want to have to interact with but here you have a man of biological anatomical chromosomal man\nUh using this law to try and force women to touch just in the tail and he actually is I think you've seen probably later on they complain his demands are that he gets to select the ah\nThe one of his choice to do this procedure to him if the owner herself won't do it\nAnd he said he says here they see that's the owner has damned Mason she has taken my dignity from ... and has left me on whole right\nI think she's left me on hold so what's what's gonna happen now now what is uh what are the possible penalties against the a ballot massage if they're found guilty of a disorder may run against this a transgender\nI mean if if this if there were repeated violations like this was say uh he was turned away three times for three or four men were turned away it could be up to fifty thousand dollars or a year in jail for these are pretty extreme penalty\nYear in jail\nIs there because this is this is built on existing civil rights laws so they added to gender identity along with you know race sex religion and things like that so they're very stringent penalties and the same would be true if I as a father if I'm waiting at the local Y. for my ... year old daughter to come out of the\nLocker room 'cause she's changing over after swim lessons and I see a guy start to go into the women's locker room and I say excuse me sir I needed away from it to my daughter comes out I Would be in violation than just the same way and could face those kind of penalties\nWere speaking most people don't know\nWe're speaking the Andrew back with from the Massachusetts family Institute which is a pushing this vote no one question three which would repeal this law ... so ... well before this law was passed two years ago would would would this guy had been able to ah to complain a and get the attention of the attorney general\nNo I wouldn't I mean this is the small as a public accommodation and you you did have people filing successfully claims for gender identity discrimination or under sex discrimination it was included under our state\nHuman rights commission masters Michigan discrimination they have that same ... vomiting restoration did that gender identity and put under sex discrimination bought under Massachusetts law it is not a lawful sex discrimination to treat men and women differently in certain circumstances like bathrooms locker and showers and I would assume\nBrazilian wax is so you would not be able to do this but the vast majority of ... of\nUm examples that you hear from the other side from the U.S on three campaign have already been covered under Massachusetts law for years\nAnd what's interesting about this case is that the attorney who helped this man filed a claim\nIs the co chair of the yes on three campaign Mason done so they know exactly what this law does and they wanted to do that they want to use this law to force women to touch men's genitals because in their mind that man is on identifies as is a woman because of his identity\nSo why people want to learn more about the question three ... and your organization where should they go\nSure of it a website called keep and a safe dot ORG keep em a safe dot org and we've got all kinds of examples their people said there haven't been any problems\nWith this law there's all kinds of examples on the website of men abusing access to women's private space is to take advantage of those when we're trying to stop\nIs this the most egregious example of of what's going on under the law\n[noise] it it's definitely the it's one that I didn't even as a fan and I've been working on this issue for years now and I did not see this coming which means who knows what else is coming if this law repealed\nAll right so the vote is uh the voters November sex this it's the statewide vote and uh I I see that they're claiming that they're way ahead yes people are way ahead but do you think that's true\nNo I mean if you look at the question for that it it just asked people if they want to remove antidiscrimination laws\nAll I see okay hope\nSo but when you asked actually tell people what the law does that involves men gaining access to women you know private space is a at those numbers change very quickly\nAll righty a Andrew back with a mask family Institute a thank you for being with us and thanks for explaining this and like I said usually I'd say we are going to post something but I think we're going to not post anything on this one it's just too gross\nI did we need to have you twist Steve pointed that out so if you if you fall asleep [laughter]\nEven if they would okay All right now I feel like I have to have to read my tweet or a [laughter] a Massachusetts woman is doing a salon because the owner refuse to give her a Brazilian wax why did the salon
