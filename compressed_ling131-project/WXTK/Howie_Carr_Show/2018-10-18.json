these cousins yeah but she has\nCousins who are ... tribal sisters I read that\nMyself and I thought to myself okay you know what I have Greek cousins because one of my cousins married married a Greek

with your ideals as an organization so you try to keep a lie under wraps is that part of it is that your your ideal is an organization the Wellesley College Democrats\nWe do not could do this act of

ancestry oh she's right Trump has to pay up on the bet that he didn't make but now they're saying no no no she was just bringing out the dead bodies right or is it a dead body or is it complete vindication of her claims and in a parasitic defeat for President Trump\nYeah but it confirming it I mean what does that mean confirming ancestry you ... everybody has ancestors right so why do you need to confirm ancestry I at least confirm she's human [laughter]\nUh\nDo you think someone says Warren has probably been going crazy worrying about someone snagging her DNA that you know what\nIf if

forty to forty two that's the toll free number of the highway car show up to like to join us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon\nThis weekend in Boston I have very him for a long awaited trial has be gone and there there's a group that's representing a Asian students\nIs suing Harvard University\nOr discriminating against the Asian students in the admissions process and it's in federal court in Boston and it's the trials expected the last several weeks it says it's a a jury wave trial it'd be a judge will be deciding in probably go to before the Supreme Court very quickly\nBut it's a it's a it's an extremely interesting case and uh one of the people who's written written extensively on it is a Stuart Taylor junior he's the author or one of the coauthors of mismatch how affirmative action hurt students it's intended to help and why universities won't admit it\nAnd he wrote he's got the uh the cover story in the Weekly Standard this week Harvard on trial and it's about the whole the whole case\nAnd we just wanted to throw away the case I Will try to keep an eye on it as a as it goes through the courts it's some of the testimony is kind of dry but it's a it's something that affects every body a store Taylor thanks for being with us here on the highway car show\nThanks for having me nice to be with you\nWhile he I think I think the take away so far and then a lot of this has been has come out in the uh the filings over the course of the the discovery process is that if if it was just based on a academic test scores\nThe Asian American percentage of the ... of the freshman class at Harvard would be forty three percent and the African American percentage of the freshman class would be less than one person is that correct\nThat's correct that was in my article about a week ago and it came out\nOf class or the first time at the trial yesterday I think yeah\nAnd I and so how how does harm by the\nWay one this one of the surprises is that it was sitting there and a public document or in the court has since June fifteenth and not one\nNewspaper the United states or magazine that I'm aware of saw fit to publish those numbers until uh until they were you know talked about at the trial\nYeah well I'd be on your credit worthy numbers\nI that was that's what that's what I led with well why don't you why don't you give me some more than a newsworthy numbers but people probably have to have\nA scene there oh nobody\nNobody here is New York times or the Washington Post knows about those numbers yet or watches and needed major television networks but I'm Glad that people on your radio show no\nYeah it's so how does how does Harvard get away with this I you know I I don't I don't understand it the ... and and the who's this guy William ... he has an Irish name but he's a he doesn't seem to be a friend of a Irish people or Asians who are white people who is this guy\nIs a is an up from a from working class guy but I Hope case of George to Harvard a motif but yeah the way they get away with it is that nobody is one is that nobody should them about it until now the two you know like all\nAll universities colleges they're pretty complicated admissions process nobody\nExcept maybe Cal Tech admits solely on the basis of grades they consider\nA you know extra curricular activities they consider athletic a talent\nThey consider a lot of um alumni connections and\nVarious other things but what a what Harvard does that ... center this trial is they also right people on so called personal qualities personality characters at a night do you have like this person that cetera and they rank the Asian Americans at the bottom of the heap and those qualities\nEven though they're on alumni interviews interviewers throughout the Asian Americans were fine and so this trial is going to focus a lot on whether Harvard has been deliberately using racial stereotypes are just flat out racial discrimination\nTo limit the number of raising the agents who get admitted to of course a lot of them get mad at the claim as if that a lot don't get admitted who are better qualified than some of the whites blacks and Hispanics\nRight well I mean it hasn't harbored a publicly acknowledged that the the the Jewish voters that they have a hundred years ago were a totally wrong and ah and racist and discriminatory\nSort of interesting you should ask during depositions in this case drew fast than the president of Harvard University with us she ...\nShe said oh no I don't really know much about the call that's NATO or so they usually has the right she's this story yeah\n[laughter] right I didn't really know that but\nYeah no it's very clear that are discriminating in history just clear and it was interesting that ah that you know when it came up she didn't just shooting at seven I think it was similar yeah they just say yeah that was terrible that was a long time ago we don't do that uh they said gee you know we don't know about that\nUh which um I mean the end of my article I\nSay quality close by a back how the president of Harvard and the current president at Yale salad the both of them said in essence we don't discriminate against anybody\nAnd those I send my article and I believe strongly were bald chase flies a bald face flies now it you know it it's a it's a trial issue or whether they discriminate

is is suffering this a great embarrassment or they wouldn't be suffering this great embarrassment if the if the mainstream media were covered in the case\nYou know and these guys are so in other people too I've I've told you they're suing the University of North Carolina uh my alma mater as well and uh you know there are other cases before the Supreme Court the probably the University of Texas which was before and also used to teach at University of\nMichigan but this is the big one this is the big one 'cause it's Harvard and I ...\nI Hope Harvard loses I just hope they lose so much I just this is so wrong what they're doing it for four or five hundred forty to forty two and and apartment wasn't so hung up on race Elizabeth Warren never could have gotten away with this ah with the script\nThe scam this call on that she right ran and that's what it was mark your next with highway car go ahead mark\nThank you ... and by the way a graces imitation of life walk the Warren was one of the funniest things I've ever heard you at the gym that woman is a gym but my point is that\nWhen President Trump calls Democrats party of crime the facts show is right in fact the fake news won't record for example in California they've been giving early release two convicted criminals are men and women and\nNow a pack a prize show\nThat crime is increase\nThe I I Know mark they're only about prosecuting people for shoplifting and it it's it's like the whole thing but you know Giuliani and the bill Bratton head a New Yorker by broken windows you know if you don't if you don't enforce my on on minor\nSo called crimes that people are going to commit bigger crimes and and you know if you if you let him get away with a property crime they're going to commit a crime against a person and a California has totally forgotten all the lessons of the Giuliani here in New York\nYeah I'll eat like maybe like the guy in New York got slashed but they're also the Democrats or decriminalize drugs which increases crime also okay yeah\nNo I I look at look at it here in Massachusetts I mean you have judges who are refusing to was imprisoned heroin dealers because they're illegal aliens because they would otherwise be deported so they give them a a\nA suspended sentence and I mean it's ridiculous I mean a heroin kills people you know [noise]\nAnd because at the end of the American would go to prison for selling heroin and an illegal alien doesn't [noise] if you if\nIf you have two sets of laws for different groups of people [noise] pretty soon you have no laws for any fine thanks for

viewing GMC in Concord New Hampshire thanks autos dot com\nParty WICK west you are much Cape Cod and I argue radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK [noise]\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Brian clock sixteen days ago\nJournalist Jamal ... walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and has not been seen since the Turks say he was killed in dismembered but the Saudis deny involvement without saying what he's basing that conclusion on\nCausing this uh this uh self immolation apparently I was involved in it she didn't want me being a me outing her so she decided to out herself I mean that's a pathetic excuse but that's that's what she's reduced to now she says she's just our\nOur our cars that you did this\nAnd and the funny thing is you know and I think maybe the president had a little bit to do with it I don't want to take all your\nI I don't know I must share the credit yes with someone else of yours\nBut then again I don't know who is that by using many people on on on the Democratic side but who sends out twenty six tweets directed the president in a very short period of time and one after the other she seemed\nUnhinged I think the guy who could be Trump or the girl that could be Trump is the type of person that doesn't\nTake the bait from him and tries to out Trump Trump because whenever we've seen that happen whether it be Marco Rubio during the primaries or Jeb Bush would they get taken out of their element and their personality and they tried to out Trump Trump it blows up spectacularly so whether it's her or Korea hair or Cory Booker Kamala\nHarris that's not the type of person who could really challenge chocolate twenty twenty it'll be somebody who is just more measured and centrists and just kind of dismisses ... any personal barred from Trump like yeah I'm just going to concentrate on the issues that matter the American people and she has shown already\nThat she is not ready for twenty twenty if that's the way she's going to act on Twitter which was like a lunatic\nRank right judge Cherokee Nation sent out that the excoriated press release about about six o'clock Seventy two hours ago and and less than an hour later she went on this weather rage\nAnd and you're right she seemed demented and my my favorite of the twenty six or twenty twenty six weeks that she sent out in Seventy four minutes was\nHe's a bully and he scares very easy and I'm thinking to myself talking about so he scares very easy this is your ... in\nIn in an hour and you're the one who's coming across as a\nAs as petrified to mortified here you know she's she gave away the game and and\nAnd our media is that such a great job political maybe I Want to narrow it down to that I still think local\nNews always New York I think they do an excellent job but that's another conversation for another time but the fact that when this first came out and you see all the headlines strong evidence proof that she is Native American they jumped to the narrative they want it before they really looked at what the study was including the Boston Globe by the way which as you know\nHad to make not one but two corrections on simple math\nSuch a big story like this you think they checked that part out a little bit better but no it's a matter of being first set of accurate and everybody followed suit to say see Elizabeth Warren has been to ... and then once Cherokee Nation came out that was the big big\nTurning point then suddenly now you don't hear much about the story anymore let's put it this way out let's play a little game but the show and the other foot\nDonald Trump lies about his heritage says he's a Native American so he can get into the University of Pennsylvania do you think that story would have gone away the way this one has abide by Thursday if you said that on Monday no the apocalypse will be upon us and the and the end and basically that the planet we'll just shrink into a big ball of lava that what it would be the end\nSo yeah that's the funny part about this right to be mockery ... ready to kill instead it's been kind of muted for the most part except from conservative media and that's why there's a good counter balance with our media now which Twenty years ago we did not have\nYeah I I I said my column the next day I sent a memo to the Boston Globe fake news is tough make math is tougher\nIt really is and and\nI really I really have enjoyed the whole story but listen there's there's other news breaking that you wanted to talk about like this or Elle magazine or what would tell us about what's going on with them\nElle magazine alley puts out a tweet saying that Kim car Daschle and Kanye West been married for a couple of years I Believe they have two children together or they are getting a divorce\nRight and you see this and it's not like it's from the onion and it's not like it's from a a typical type of publication where he is the question is el magazine but you think I guess is that nine right I mean it's basically a fashion magazine and then they probably want to have a story like that and then sure enough you click on it and it's a register to vote page in other words\nThey can't line fake news you can go to a page and vote and it's just so funny that they pick two people to celebrities that have actually shown they support this president and that that's that's the couple that's divorced thanks\nAgain our media is so completely ... has no stop awareness when they do this stuff how much it hurts the profession and every day you could come up with at least one example and then Chris ... is the editor at large at CNN twenty found he says oh this was brilliant\nOh really oh really it's really end up without fake headlines that you're actually in doors thing this I don't even know what the painting or how he has a media reporter I Can't even be shocked because it happened so often I'm nothing by the whole thing I mean I'm sure you weren't there was a radio host\nFence that's what that's what Mussolini used to say you know he was a tabloid editor before he got into politics and and you know his his owners would that that's the turn on a dime they go from being right wing or left wing and he said as long as it's entertaining nobody cares you know as long as you write of entertaining headlines it doesn't really matter and\nI mean we've come full circle a hundred years later and that's the that's the attitude and they're gone back to the needle Mussolini days\nIt seems that way I wasn't around to that unfortunately I Believe you call that sophomore year but may I I wasn't around [laughter] anyway just having some fun\nBut yeah look you look at the last couple of weeks and you look at the way the Capitol hearing\nFor recovered and just how horribly that whole thing was presented and the boomerang effect it's had on Democrats in terms of Republicans as I'm not going through the roof ... terms and suddenly you are seeing some real momentum behind the ...\nAnd then you see Elizabeth Warren and and this stunt which at least for two or three days again galvanize that ... to say we got to get out to the polls so I think\nOctober has gotten very bad for Democrats I'm not saying they don't take back the house but I think I would've said it was Ninety percent that even three weeks ago I think it's a toss up not quite frankly end up probably gain seats in the second one I thought that that was even in jeopardy\nYeah you you know and another thing we just we we just had a guy on talking about the uh the the Harvard a race discrimination suit which is a big I'm very very big case and Elizabeth Warren dropped her quote unquote bombshell about which is another just another affirmative action scam\nThe same day that this case\nBegan in in us federal district court shooting so she doesn't care she ... she doesn't care about anyone else about her you know her institution they gave her her ... she just drags them into this uh to the dumpster fire the chiefs created for herself\nYou know it's it's really it really is amazing the way the the news cycle works now nobody cares about anything else but themselves and and\nHere's the thing it's not like Republicans are are mocking Elizabeth Warren and saying what are you doing I mean Jim Messina who is President Obama's campaign manager in two thousand twelve even says\nDemocrats can't focus what what what was she thinking base 'cause I don't have it in front of me yeah paraphrasing ... what are you doing this is the stupidest thing now three weeks before the mid term you had to put this out\nAnd no one cares about your twenty twenty Rodney in January when you're when you're thinking about doing it now I get everybody it's not just not being self aware selfish on her part\nAnd it's a shame that the Boston Globe just can't say you know I'd be screwed this up and and not one writer there no one op ed can go out just challenging or on this I it's sad rarely I mean\nWhen you rather be a contrarian than than just be part of an echo chamber disagrees with everything and everybody in our media so afraid now not giving comfort food to what they think their audiences want to hear instead of what they should here and they're all cowards basically that that's a shame\nJoe will fund with the with these people are never going to realize is it's fun being a reporter it's fun\nYou know going on digging up news and and no one you gotta buy yourself and it's a scoop and you you know it makes you look really like a cool guy as opposed to just being another another person in the uh the ... courses Pat Buchanan used to call in on whatever side you're on you know\nYeah I had I had I had a lot of respect for unfair I did with that Harvey Weinstein thing the way he went about it and went to another ... ... what's clearly did\nAnd then during the justice Kavanaugh thing I got to tell you you know when he came out that second accuser and there was almost no verification around it affect the occasion around that that was a story about how Kavanaugh exposed himself during a dorm party at Yale you know five\nYears ago but then they couldn't find one person to corroborate it ah that's that was very unfair liking it seemed very politically motivated I'm like he's boy I really thought there was hope we are and how even showed me that that he\nHe I I Know he's confirmed that he said well we wanted to show that maybe there was a pattern maybe there's a\nPattern come on now hey you know where I was trying to\nGet a girl pregnant and got a girlfriend it maybe go with the story you have to verify trust but verify [laughter]\nAll right Joe ...

called the lacy um address from Eighteen thirty eight it was I guess ... ... it was a Abraham Lincoln's first big speech when he was just twenty eight years old\nAnd he was talking about the mob violence and ah you know his his comments I they're they're pretty basic\nYou know if you study history the you know this but he he put it very well been some uh they've been the lynching of five gamblers believe it or not and Vicksburg, Mississippi they were trying to clean up the pharaoh dealers and these guys put up a fight and they went to them and then\nThey had uh that that led stay a black burned to death of a black guy in St Louis who was murdered I a\nWhite a pillar of the community so called and so he's talking about Abraham Lincoln talking about how you know that gamblers art much good in this the black guy was a murderer but you know you don't want mob violence in it and it really applies for what's going on with these Democrat mobs\nMainly white Democrats is that at in Arkansas said may these white Democrat mobs\nThis what Abraham Lincoln said an Eighteen thirty eight\nWhen men take it take it in their heads today\nTo hang gamblers or burn murderers they shouldn't recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely the hangar burn someone who was neither a gambler nor murder as want a whiz\nAnd that acting upon the example they set the mob of tomorrow may and probably will hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake\nAnd not only so the innocent\nThose who have never set their faces against violations of laws in
