past his latest news hook however they devoted only a miniscule portion of the cabinet coverage to the memo that was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel metro\nAnd of course again that was if it was a pretty thorough or a deep bond king of or many of her rock claims\nWe've actually got a new allegation and ... what's that there was a party at a frat after Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence that Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant but senator Coons has decided before the allegations to Grassley anyways\nOkay so Grassley basically just sent them back a letter that said you basically can they may\nYeah so this is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he and a judge or were charged with rape being a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and or at Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that to uh to to Lindsey Graham\nValue aside Grassley rights we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party with the accuser himself\n[laughter] if there's another one to here I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now\nBut a ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggest capital I wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers and a ... and ... before she could decide the Capitol I may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this

riches from his father he inherited money and then a\nHere's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way is a is a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built when I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich can not be reduced to handouts from his father\nBut that's what we've done in the headlines we've reduced it the handouts from his father 'cause that's all anyone's gonna read no who's ... who's got time to read all this they say that\nA Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year as

less than aggressive journalism or back to this again I'm just you know I Can't even got time to read the whole thing\nIt at a better by less than aggressive journalism Mr Trump has made sure his

police saying where they were they wearing a swayed jacket ruined my life jacket or could add if I let this ice cubes sit on my shoulder long enough suddenly Chuck Connors with a battery on her shoulder but it's an ice cube offended to the point that there has to be\nAn argument over an ice cube I mean I Would say we're at the point of absurdity but we didn't even stone when we cross that line we hit like speed when we got to the point of absurdity now you've got MSNBC and NBC News running in an interview with Julie sweat Nick in\nWhich she says oh yeah I got troops here some names go

that story\nBut they gave twenty minutes to that story yesterday on MSNBC and one clip drawing\nMelbourne show and clips of it played on the nightly news I tape journalism is dead but it's been

politicians\nWould try to make plausible lies you know you weren't being right through you know the truth was being sized and that was sort of part and parcel for politics\nNow they don't even try any more they throw it out there and then they walk away from it like they didn't have anything to do with it and they're on to the next one Senator Grassley sent a letter to Chris Coons today it's pretty brutal it's so ... that's circulating now in social media about an allegation that Chris Coons sent his office\nWith no substance whatsoever that alleges that judge\nKavanaugh may have attended a party after he graduated Yale\nAre strippers were in ... and it's at his old frack ... like he's not sure he was there but he wants the Senate to looking to judge Kavanaugh's calendar for that year to

sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed no drinking Han consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high end hooker call girl because at the time I weighed three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what what\nWhat what someone like her with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a Barbie so he starts um he he uh ... you start seeing\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well now\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time\nIn fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay in our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you get first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still liked it from time to time she brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma do I reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family

aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two so this is a Grassley who's writing to Coons talking about how ridiculous this letter that he said it was from this uh this guy who created a TV show in which people strip while dancing to their favorite music\nThis allegation says Senator Grassley has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem the accuser freely admits that having no evidence whatsoever the judge Kavanaugh even attended this party\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh's attendance the advisor provide some investigative advice he proposes that someone search judge Kavanaugh's calendars the very same calendars that your colleagues have dismissed them\nRide with regard to Dr Ford's allegations to determine whether he attended a fraternity party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven or Nineteen eighty eight and that's at\nAll he alleges that he wants to witness a salacious party at a house owned by judge Kavanaugh's undergraduate fraternity he then separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars did the term determine if he attended\nHe wraps up Senator Grassley in this letter to senator Coons we've reached a new level\nOf absurdity with this allegation there was no evidence the judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near this party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser himself\nThe loan connection between judge Kavanaugh and the events described by the accuser is that as an undergraduate judge Kaplan I was a member of the fraternity that hosted the party\nThe purpose of this allegation is playing to smear judge Kavanaugh's name again by associating him with the party's house this guilt by association tactic is the basis form of political attack and deserves unqualified condemnation\n\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two are on our local news last night the the NC State
