L. but it's it's the same company now we're we're right in the we're right in the ... studios base where we are in the ... studios actually 'cause this is where they\nDo the uh the damned ratio later in the later in the evening aid for so but tonight tonight it will be the uh the debate at\nLeast for the first hour or so or the hour and a half\nAnyway aid for four or five hundred forty to forty to aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm a I'm happy to have ah two worked on the Elizabeth Warren story and uh you know I\nI pushed it as much as I could and you know people said I was crazy and they said I was a racist and all this uh but you know you know who put it over the top\nElizabeth Warren yeah the fake Indian she gave it to ... yeah I couldn't have done it without Elizabeth Warren\nDid hear on the train now\nAnd and and also like to think the president of the United states [laughter] for keeping\nI I was a supporting actor he he's the one who basically put\nIt over that's why that's why she thought that she could get a lot of ... [laughter] I don't\nWant to thank our white [laughter] but anyway\nThere's a couple of more a decent story so that we should read before we wrap up the week here tonight to Rebecca ... is a a Cherokee member of the Cherokee Nation and she's a writer and she's a Cherokee historian and she wrote something for USA Today\nElizabeth Warren's part Cherokee claim as a joke and a racist insult to natives like me Cherokee Nation\nThe largest tribe and the United states in a public statement said the Warren juice of a DNA test was inappropriate and wrong and said the senator is quote undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage unquote neither Warren nor the Democratic party has responded to the statement\nThis is Rebecca and they go in USA Today as Cherokee genealogist of research and I have repeatedly written about Warren descend from a long line of well documented white people I Love that phrase well documented why people [laughter]\nWas it the blonde hair blue eyes that uh they gave it away well Warren no longer identifies herself as Native American chief still publicly claimed her family is quote unquote part Cherokee\nThere is nothing innocent about a white woman claiming her ancestors experience genocide an ethnic cleansing in inescapable\nFact for Cherokee families when they did not why is this so hard to understand\nAnd then she mentioned that uh you know her her a ridiculous statements that she knew but she she was part Cherokee because some relatives had high cheekbones quote like all the Indians do let me think of a Republican said something like that\nThey're saying the debate is also the debate tonight is also on CSPAN so you can see it on C SPAN or on the channel thirty eight\nBut DNA test Warren took only shows and not conclusively a bat that she may have an ancestor who was indigenous to Mexico Colombia or Peru\nUsing this test to support her claim of Cherokee heritage is not only false based on the science but also perpetuates a common and racist stereotype the Native Americans or a hot homogenous group\nIs good\nI'm Glad I'm Glad they're calling her out and she deserves to be called out\nHow the other thing is I think she\nElizabeth Warren thought that you were the only person who was offended by that and she was so condescending like every year at the breakfast to St Patrick's Day breakfast she said well I was only tally cars not here and make some joke I think you were the only person who cared about that and now it's obvious because of her\nBringing it up that a lot of people are offended by that they just probably didn't know that much about it and now she's come out and laid on the table and people are thinking\nOh wow this really is a horrible thing to take advantage of and\nAnd I thought everybody had forgotten about it because it when when she first was outed in the twenty twelve election\nThat were there were Cherokee groups that actually came here to Massachusetts they weren't even from around here they came and they demand that the they went to her campaign offices and the demand that are asked to speak to her and she refused to see him\nAnd you know she she got away with it and she was getting away with it it's a ... I'm\nI'm Glad she's busted and here's one more from a Jennifer ... who went to Harvard law school when all this when she first got the job and she's talking about how her uh her maybe she says maybe a Elizabeth Warren's uh\nParents for her uh relatives did tell her that she was a that she was part Indian but the Jennifer ... says but such tales belong\nIn the realm of family lore not in the realm of racial preferences the reason we're talking about Elizabeth Warren's ancestry today more than six years after the story originally broke\nThis because she used this family story to boost her chances of obtaining teaching jobs is a time when the elite law schools were desperate to hire racial and ethnic minorities\nHarvard law was no exception so this woman Jennifer ... was going to Harvard law school in the early nineties when when Elizabeth Warren was hired", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "19"}
