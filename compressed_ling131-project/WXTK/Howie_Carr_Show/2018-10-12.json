talking to how we about during the break I Want to read this story it just stumbled across from the a P which you know the a P is they used to be\nConsidered pretty down in the middle keyword rush said it's state controlled media yeah so now they're ... they're just is left is any anyone else so you know if they're writing this that things are looking pretty bad for the blue wave\nThis with the title can we talk Trump's riding high and he's got a lot to say\nSo basically the entire article which I suggest everyone read and just talking about how Trump is doing these rallies every night he hasn't had a bad story and a couple and what he considers he hasn't had a bad story in a week I mean there had been raped by him but nothing that really is bothering him\nAnd he's getting all amped up from these rallies he's taking questions he's letting people in air force one he's taking so many questions that it says\nThis is a quote it said any other questions Trump asked to stun styling the reporters can't come up with questions out they complain so much that you know he's not having enough\nProbably young fallback questions like are you still getting two scoops of ice cream every night what happened to the west of Martin Luther king\n... one of his guy that I think he's having a lot of fun right now he's had a couple of successes recently and now he's just really riding that's high and it seems like it's working and the more ... ... women by the you know what\nThe more he the question if you take like that that was one of the most amazing things as a couple of weeks ago when he was just taking question after question and then Jim Acosta was like do you mind sir I'm when I'm done if you'll take a question from a female colleague of mine and he just looked at him and goes\nWhat what is he talking about like healthy questions or anybody any station like he doesn't care now because you know with Jim Acosta is grace uses the oh he is a day and capital be\nYeah he's a showboat to either show horse like there's nothing really to questions he just as there he's there for Jim Acosta he's not there to act right get anything done\nAnd I I Want to know what are people at CNN when Jim does this does his routine in the White House press briefing today is a good job job that was great thanks for taking a stab\nI Know it's so bizarre and I just think that um it it it is true what they said that it it knew a lot of\nDanger you know he could he could he could be cut now is any moment for the weekly like him he really is and physical dangerous if brief could blow 'em over\nThey say about when I'm Sean Spicer what the press secretary they they would say oh my God you've got to get him out of their trumpeted best messenger\nAnd I do think Sarah Huckabee Sanders on a daily basis doesn't amazing job but that is really the truth is that when he gets out there and answer those questions he just had the way if he can respond to things so quickly and he throws these people back in their heels and so I don't know about the blue wave by if things keep going the way they're going fingers crossed it's looking pretty good for Republicans\nWhy is why is Trump giving an interviewer sixty minutes so what's the\nWord of it there's part of him that ... that enjoys you know the liberal media right yeah I mean he talks with the New York times quite a bit as much as he's called at the failing New York times and says it's fake news\nSaid he's talking to a Lesley Stahl who's you know the Republican on the as as it were on on sixty minutes but still I mean what's the I just don't get the the upside of that\nWhat I Want to talk about it is to an end I did something today for the first time that I've never done before I issued a complaint to CNN 'cause actually filed a complaint through what what their ... their feedback paid I looked it up I said CNN feedback and they said hey like\nIt's the feedback we've allowed this bin Laden and so we did\nHave a file grace you can play a clip here is finding the trash can end up you're out washing up yes\nBut I just wanted them to know that I Am just stopped dead absolutely disgusted with John Lennon I watched him this entire morning had to look at all um clips of him from last night\nJust so condescending rolling his eyes to anyone who disagrees with them than ... mother would be rolling out a great just so rude and\nI mean I'm Still not over the whole token negro thing that with a couple of days ago and so you had to write it I said this is disgusting and you guys she making issued an apology and it isn't helping anyone he's just a man expressing his opinion and using his mental illness as some sort of stigma to get him to say what you want it's not right\nI think if you had a flood on CNN he'd get better ratings the Don lemon\nMy God I think if I had one I think we had one and only one\nGovernor would get better ratings nobody none of nobody on that channel has any ratings\nAnd you know when he died okay if I had this morning there's a lot of anger and ... and stuff like I Can't stand how you know you know like you said it sometimes they'll come in and out and like ... is the worst John Lennon may be the worst ever because this is what he does and someone disagrees then it's just made it to ... and you can play that clip later on we don't have time and now\nEven crappy quarterbacks occasionally I have a good game you know I mean you can how can you say that one is better than no no no no I'm you know he\nWent like that since he has his making points against him gathering while

uh there are few college educated white women what you have is white women with pen that college\nAge four for five hundred forty to forty two by the way a to a seven says I'm not sure if you've heard the news but the New York times just wrote a story about Maine Republican candidate for governor Sean moody and an alleged sex discrimination case in two thousand six yeah that's that's\nMore jive apparently he you know the guy ran a he runs a big auto parts company and it's we have a lot of female employees so this woman's left\nOr to have a kid and then she came back and she wasn't doing very well so she lost her job for for whatever reason so she sued and you know rather than go through you know spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills a lot of times uh employers just saddle up\nAnd you sign a a a a a confidentiality agreement so it's not it's not it's not like he was wrapping her or anything she he claims that she she didn't do her job after she had the kid\nAnd so she said I Want a you know I Want some money so we gave her some money to go away and she signed day confidentiality agreement but guess what\nSean ... the Republican candidate for governor has had ... ...\nThat's the weirdest thing that this didn't come out in any of his previous campaigns yeah strange time if you had the U.S happened that\nHappened twelve years ago this happened twelve years ago in both sleuths\nAt the New York times has somehow were able to on earth these ah these nuggets of information and by the way she opens herself and so he can't ... can't comment because he too is bound by the the confidentiality agreement\nAnd being a Republican he has to observe the the the contract because he's required to under the law but ... ...\nUh you know he has integrity to yeah he's a guy who won the ... what's his name on something he follows it\n[laughter] this is just this is complete jive let's ah you know let's go after the the real uh the the real events that happened like ah like the the Senate candidate in Arizona\nSaying that everybody in her home state is crazy and that the Arizona is the meth lab of democracy\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty to Jim your

political seemed like\nA lot more than I ever have I have to question I Know there's something in the founding fathers writing that talks about not Slater influenced by entertainers and I just thinking out of the philosophical principle ... could expound on that and maybe you\nKnow I don't doubt for Bill you're with that I I heard\nSomewhere I second but it is that what exactly is the\nFights that like what is going on with this whole thing I understand what had happened but I'm going to go and fight\nISIS is be it ... it refers to the foreign intelligence surveillance court\nAnd these courts were set up in the uh the Nineteen seventies and they they they weren't used all that often I think until after uh nine eleven\nBut what you do is you have the government goes in it's a secret court and the the the the judges on their federal judges in their ... by the uh the chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court in this case Roberts\nAnd ah so they hear the these are secret there it's a secret court and they go in and image you're only supposed to use the court if you if you you can't if if you'd be giving away a ... impact counter intelligence a\nState secrets national security uh\nQuestions would be raised if you went into an open court like a U.S district court and so the these ... these are it's a secret it's a secret court and so the thing is in a secret court obviously a guy like Carter Page who get surveilled\nHeating he doesn't get a get notification that there are about the surveillance so you have to you have to have\nHonesty\nBy the prosecutors by the federal government because otherwise it could be ... the process could be totally abused at what happened here to him\nIs that a is that the or the FBI the corrupt FBI the corrupt Justice Department the corrupt Obama administration was taking a it was taking campaign smear material for Hillary Clinton and going to the court and telling the court\nBut that they that this was a real intelligence rather than just a made up nonsense paid for by Hillary Clinton\nAnd and again because it was a secret court there was no pushback\nFrom any defense witnesses are defense attorneys and that that's where the that's that's how this terrible abuses occurred\nHoly crap so why aren't people in jail on I Know that sounds silly but like what what is the process like live give us the bike millennials to all of this thing can you give us ...\nYeah ... where people are being taught in lies and\nWe don't know well I mean they've ... they've been well they ... we know they've been caught in lies on this Carter Page that's that's just what Joe the ... the former U.S attorney was saying but Carter Page they they they went into in October of two thousand sixteen using these Clinton\nCampaign documents totally concocted fabricated and pretend that they were raw intelligence they didn't tell the judge but they ... that you know where these are where these allegations said come from and then they renewed\nThe or the war and there was only for Ninety Days they renewed it three times three times and the last renewal was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd he claims that they
