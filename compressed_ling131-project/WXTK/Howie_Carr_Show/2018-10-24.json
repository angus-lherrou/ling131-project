I'm Serious about illegal immigration and border security for all kinds of reasons including keeping opioids poison out of our country asking me heroin rather to substitute for opioid pills and also to make sure we know who's in the country they've got to do this\nIllegally is a very serious issue\nThe stakes are very high in this election\nAnd your uh your your opponent though is ah is is saying that the you know he he wants to make it all about the uh about the health care doesn't me\nYeah and you know this doesn't make any sense to me how he is is to a push everybody into a one hundred percent government run bureaucracy it'll cost thirty two trillion dollars double everybody's taxes\nUh enroll in Medicare uh you know and and if you have insurance through your employer\nIt's

people appear to uh uh to when we don't think that's going to happen I'm committed a that's not going to happen we're meeting with\nHundreds of people on the ground every day and we get a heck of a lot of support and I and I think when it comes to Shaun ... who's running for governor another business professional I'm a business professional I spent thirty five years creating jobs and my opponent has absolutely\nZero experience creating jobs and I'm On top of that he has a horrible record\nUh when it comes to a Second Amendment\nOr where I've repeatedly or stood up for a Second Amendment rights and Jared Golden it's not\nThat should be enough to win right there and the second desperate the main should not I mean everybody's everybody's got a gun right\nAh yeah it's a very big deal up here and I'm the only candidate who is repeatedly stood up for a Second Amendment rights in your goals and has a duty rating an F rating which you know the n._r._a. and the gun owners in Maine but I'll tell you another thing that's really important is our economy\nIs doing better all the time we are at\nTwo point seven percent unemployment in the state of Maine we have a more jobs than we have folks are able to fill those jobs we've got\nTo continue to go forward and continue to improve our economy not go back in the ditch and in an example on the ballot how you won't believe this uh on the first question on the on on the ballot first referendum question is do you want to add three point eight\nPercentage points to are already high state income tax\nUh and uh that would put us uh almost at eleven percent double what the Massachusetts' highest rate is and Jared Golden is the only visible political figure up here that supports it including among the folks running for governor he would put us in the hole in the heck would come up to me\nAnd and start a small business or move up here if you got to pay eleven percent almost eleven percent\nA personal income tax rate or a small business it's a crazy idea I've ever seen in my life but that's the difference\nYou level ... eleven percent income tax rate eleven worse than right now it's\n... well right now at seven point one five you add three point eight to it it's ten point nine five percent that's what golden support\nWell to be clear how was it that that tax only apply to millionaires and billionaires like basically people making more than a hundred and twenty thousand dollars [laughter]\nYeah right that's the ultimate Trojan Horse we we dodged the bullet down here in Massachusetts on that they wanted to put the millionaires tax and we all know it's going to be like on people making forty fifty thousand bucks a year that pushed to throw it will be the same thing in Maine it's ridiculous slow by about\n...

collar jobs the economy has got to continue to go forward that's why I've worked so hard to lower rates ... fair trade deals in my opponent has\nZero experience in that area was it Jack up taxes and throw everybody into a one hundred percent run government bureaucracy when it comes to health care\nSo if you if you want higher taxes crappy health insurance and no guns\nFantasies about\nKilling
