I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the Web site called five her but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for

here all my question and it's a ... to ... all along reputation management I guess my first let them would be like well with me the best oh yeah that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you can search and then the field that search engine optimization ethical would all fall out\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nAll the problem all been with them or if it's obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bad reviews balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go online and foot post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so what am I here mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I needed to find something someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay [noise]\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do with and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right [noise] right\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the way it's like ... grade a car okay all lady they use excel\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews the with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive or do you think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you help on line and\nJust kept coming up in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay\nOkay so that's the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can\nIs with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay\nUm there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I guess\nI get it but where if you pay them a certain fee that they will spotlight your business you'll\nHave more tools available to you\nYou'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay\nAnd to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the

because I'm concerned that if a mistake is made there's going to be a problem\nSo I don't really like this particular track but yeah there are ways out there that it can be done\nVery very important item and you know over the years on Monday talk or for our regular listeners and we thank you for that by the way while we're on the thought\nSo many of our listeners over the years have called about rip offs and I was reading an article this weekend in the New York times about this very topic a very good article that appeared in the Saturday New York times and it really is a cautionary tale\nFor those of you involved with for example with your parents money\nMaybe involving business with the brokerage and how many times uh we had callers on money talks has talked about this very topic where they have a problem\nThis particular story that I reference and I recommend to money talkers involves a brokerage account\nAt a major US Bank you know a lot of the banks have brokerage arms so this account was at one of those brokerage arms the details are named in the article\nSo\nThe daughter of of the individual that was the focus of the article the daughter of that individual\nFound that there was unusual activity in her mother's account was she was overseeing and had been overseeing in recent years and one of the things that caught our attention\nWas that the account dropped one hundred thousand dollars in just one month during a period while the market was increasing most of this money was in the market despite the fact that her mother was in her eighties which doesn't make a lot of sense to me but that's what the article says and I'm sure that was the case\nSo the account was very very heavily in the stock market despite the advanced age of the owner of the account so the daughter hired council hired a forensic accountant or a forensic consultant one of the other\nAnd they found commissions and the account for the year\nOf one hundred twenty eight thousand dollars\nOne hundred twenty eight thousand in commission's charge that the count for the year which was about ten percent of the total value\nOf the account\nThere's some out being paid out then commissions in a relatively short period of time well what happened was most of the portfolio had been sold out and then the money to reinvest it and of course the commission's piling up on all of these transactions and in one month alone\nThey found three hundred forty four traits\nThis is really staggering and it's real and these were in the unsolicited category well unsolicited means directed by the customer but of course that was not true the the mother of this daughter was not directing these trades in any way shape or form\nAlso another thing they found when they did their forensic work was pieces of stock we're being sold in small watts so if you had a thousand shares you might sell Seventy five than a hundred and twenty five and so on and so on even in the same day\nAnd of course that can pile up the commission says well sometimes the commission's can be larger on usually they are larger on the smaller lots\nSet ups the commission costs as well another thing they found was that was a margin account which allows you to borrow money to invest more well you don't do that when you're in your eighties and if you really smart you don't do it at all\nSo as the article describes there was a settlement was reached but obviously the overall result of this was kind of ugly and unpleasant\nOne call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average

nine three four twenty to Twenty one on our jab or fest talk and thought hey let's get out the Glenn door California Mike you're on Monday talk\nI talk to talk to you got a quick question was of course I listen you're not on live in LA I just want to talk to your point\nWe are on ... we are on we are on who we are on a ... a different schedule but we are on KBC Los Angeles you'll have to check the station for the schedule that they keep yes we are on KBC\nBut not live I'm so out sometime sometimes it is sometimes\nOkay great listen I have a I'm retiring next year\nA have a four hundred and fifty K. and um [noise] some funds that I wanted to invest in number three ... number three [noise]\nAnd um I I Want it to find out when you talk about dollar cost averaging on that size you typically suggests you know four five six pieces um per dollar cost averaging\nAnd at the at the back a little bit of a background you know we just passed this last week the longest running a bull market catching up a nineties\nAnd that's why I'm anticipating based on your mark newsletter which was very helpful in October\nLetter or a year ago you save ... mid term set back this year and so I took advantage that much\nOf that does help pay for the you know the letter many many times over a but anticipating a market a topic in the next let's just say the next year year and a half a dollar cost averaging watch that many how many\nUh peace should I be putting my money into or apple you know how should it be breaking up into\nWell uh when would you be doing this investing right now\nI Would be doing it within the next month or two\nYeah I Would say on model three on a fixed income side of the portfolio that um I don't\nI don't regard and need right now and the central need for dollar cost averaging owned a fixed income side and the reason I say that as we've largely inoculated that fixed income side of the portfolio by selecting a short duration\nPortfolio assets in fact our average duration on a fixed income side now is less than one year and so with an average\nDuration of less than one year and the current yielding that portfolio in terms of the uh interested income stands that a little bit over three percent\nI think we've covered the bases on that side of the port bully we're getting nice yield in terms of the current income and we've a reduced the duration down to a\nVery very low level on equity side really that comes down to your tolerance for risk to some degree\nBecause uh the fact of the matter is that um\nIf you're going to a dollar cost averaging money and you want to do it in a way where if something goes awry in the market you're not going to panic and do something in the ... going to be counterproductive\nSo I Would move but then on a schedule that you're comfortable with in terms of of your tolerance for risk and I think that would be the key in terms of of how you'd be moving that money and\nYou're absolutely right we're looking at a market that is basically the longest bull market of cyclical bull market ever were nine and a half years and so are there had been times to get really excited about putting money in the market\nUh I remember the a secondary by signal we had a secondary means we were fully invested so it applies to those looking for an opportunity we had a great a while and awesome secondary by signal\nIn um [noise] back in two thousand eleven\nBack in September of two thousand eleven yes be five hundred was in the low eleven hundreds I mean this things than the twentieth hundreds now so that was an awesome by signal we had back in September of two thousand eleven\nAnd a and I remember also we had a a terrific secondary by signal because we were already fully invested so this is for those looking for that opportunity that exceptional opportunity and that occurred again in um\nFebruary of two thousand sixteen for crying out loud ESP five hundred was in the Eighteen hundreds or talking about an index is than twenty hundreds now it was in the Eighteen hundreds in February of two thousand six team when they get and we had a secondary by signal\nSo I mean they were fantastic opportunities but but\nThey don't come along every day opportunities like that don't come along every day so um I mean even people that dollar cost average money into the market in two thousand Eighteen at the at the lowest level we've seen they were still in the twenty six hundred area\nThe lowest closing level we've seen in two thousand Eighteen\nWas only in the twenty six hundred area no big deal we're in the twenty eight hundreds so those kinds of opportunities that we saw in September of two thousand eleven with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the lower loving hundreds wow that's a buying opportunity big time\nUh and the kind of opportunity we saw in February of two thousand six team with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the Eighteen hundreds well that was a

would like to get him investing in the stock market um he's got a head on a ... you just received the ... of around twenty five grand\nAnd they had a savings account prior to that but he saved up to like Fifteen hundred bucks over a long period of time and I would have ... paper work out you know so we so he was doing something I Would like to have\nTo know a thinking about fidelity or or um uh one of the a disco stock houses where you can get information\nBut then have him to the ... you know do the actual trade when it comes with we'll talk about it together and try to pick the right one of the start of us think some of this money got\nWell now I mean I think I think it's a good idea I think that a meal only need a three thousand dollars to open a a a personal a personal account how old is this youngster\nIs sixty\nYeah okay well you want to have it ... through may yeah OK\nYou have to do a cuss the custody accountant actually get ready custody and initially but then he'll get to be Eighteen shall\nWe of anyway [laughter] so I was just\nA ... ... ... so he doesn't get tempted with that with the money you know [laughter]\nWell I I think that it's fairly easy for a personal account for example was probably about three thousand dollars of vanguard probably about twenty five hundred dollars or so\nAt the ... the first one that I Would buy would be to get started would be a double the\nSparked in total stock market index or vanguard till the stock market index depending on which company you go to but I think that's a great way to get started and then they can dollar cost averaging as he wishes going forward I think the only\nCaviar is that you know as you're going to need money if he's going to need money going\nForward than you know\nHe's in a position where he has an investment account in that case in the stock market which certainly tends to fluctuate as we know\nAnd so there should be money that he really is investing a on a longer term basis I think as as it gets started move as opposed to a money that he's actually going to need to go forward while he appreciate the call bill is in Missouri bill it's your turn\nI thank you for taking my call I'm trying to determine the best way to withdraw money from investments when I retire I like to tell you the two approaches I'm considering\nThe first one would be to take four percent of my investments each year starting with non IRA won ... gone go to regular IRA and then brought by a re\nApproach number two would be to take all of my interest dividends and capital gains\nAnd then if I have money left at the end of the year I weighed reinvest it\nDoes that make sense\nWell I think it makes a lot of sense for you to collect your interest and your dividends against that four percent withdraw guideline that you're starting with because I think what you're going to find is you will you will have some years\nWhere the some of your interest and dividends and capital appreciation could exceed that four percent figure and certainly uh I Would reinvest that money if that happens\nThere'll be there'll be other years when they match up very closely\nThere could be other years where your dividends and you're interested in your capital gains are dumped him up to the four percent which you in which case you can liquidate a small number of shares in order to get to that four percent figure but I think that that should work\nOkay\nI Would say that I'm not sure that I liked the idea\nOf putting the traditional\nA tax brokerage account before the Ross tax pros you know because the money you take from the ... just a gallon his tax free if you follow the rules\nSo I think I'd probably do a um a slight change there I'd probably priority to prioritize the personal money and then I'd probably use the Ross money and then lastly I'd probably use the traditional Monday because that's going to be taxable when you take it out\nOkay I'd reverse the order of those too but I wouldn't actually tap into any of that ah until one of those years when I didn't get four percent by taking interest dividends et\nCetera yeah and and in that case and that's a good way to look at it and uh\nYou mean where you didn't get the four percent from your personal portfolio right that's a very good way to look at it because I'm what you could do then is you could use your lost money as your backup money and you still would not create any tax liability by doing that okay\nThank you very much for your help great to hear from you built checking in from the show me\nState in ...

Bush the president\nMade a proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done\nThat would have done extremely well because he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels for a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the place a small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed\nThen uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they're just in case there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of govern\nWhat maybe there was a condition of talking about is that that money cannot be touch Social Security retirement age and maybe the concern that passed laws that money is going to be touched prior to that that is at risk and the stock market but also this money couldn't be invested in\nA ... so the U.S government uh or twenty five or ... what should be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money in the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I Do you I thought that\nMoney you know the ah yeah but that they consider it the equivalent because that's the rate of interest that earns is the equivalent it ... it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a\n... year right now because you know why because all the money is getting all more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it out of the beneficiaries and that's where we're headed\nAnd so the whole thing is a under the unified budget\nThere's no question about it uh the the whole concept of a trust fund with money out there\nYeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct\nBut I don't see any any one first of all I don't see any one politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand uh I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and again\nThemselves they prove that themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago although it\nHow about this in Chicago I got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by the icy and I'm trying to fight a that is a problem\nThe reason that I have the money and money market accounts um is that\nI'm not sure how long I'm going to live and I don't want to tie up my money in a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time so that it would be a a hindrance to my\nEars and I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it in a money market at this point\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like a vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it\nBut I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it or there is another way for you to do this which is just known short term treasury bills which can be liquidated the anytime\nOkay\nCould use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three month treasury bills then or those monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt\nFrom um state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nA the Illinois state income tax on interest you earned on a treasury bill so that might be an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase short term rates\nAnd so that certainly is something else is going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that

nine three four twenty to Twenty one we're going to Truckee, California Leanne welcome to talk\nAbout taking my call I had a question for you I could and it has to do with model portfolio number three I have it through vanguard and I was looking after that they had more money at the bond that and it looks like I don't know if I'm allowed to many of the ... and that are not\nWell a one or two just asked me your your question a generic form\nOkay sounds good on one of them it looks like when I look it up last week at vanguard and looking at the gate ill and so if I take that in ... to kind of take it through the end it here and that would be a decade return it looks like I'd be better off going into the\nPrime money market rather than going into that and then the second part of that question what ... ... ... what\nWhat did that have to do with the annual return how does that relate\nWell they're all they're all love your differently and uh so\nYou know if as long as you're consistent I think that's probably the most important part of it as long as you're consistent with how you're doing it but\nUh it depends which fund you're looking at and ah it can be very complicated known how these deals are constructed because you have current field you have the maturity of SEC of distribution deal I mean it just goes on and on but I Would say as far as the money market fund component of that particular portfolio\nThe yield on that right now is over two percent\nAnd I think for someone that just wants to have a very very simplified portfolio as I've said before you can use that money market fund or you can use a C. D. ladder\nNow if you're going to use the ... uh you could use for example equal amounts of the three six nine and twelve months CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration you know our average duration in a portfolio is less than one year your average duration on a three six nine twelve months CGI would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year\nAnd that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there were various ways in a rising interest rate environment that you can go it depends on how a wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all\nThen the CD letter fully FDIC insured is risk free it's held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and that money market fund is also something to consider and we've included that as part of that portfolio\nLet's get up to the great cayenne us radio Denver\nLon it is your turn will\nAffect as for the time I waited for your ...\nThank you for holding on and I do appreciate your patience thinking\nIf I have two daughters my a fourteen year old I Need to do a college five twenty nine plan for\nAnd I have a hundred thousand set aside for that I'd like to know what would make up last time what would be the next turn a college but I've heard I I Would recommend and then I have a twenty eight year old who she just finished\nHer medical school and I'd like to I heard in the long term IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something ah with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend that you consider starting with something like either the ah\nThe delta the spartan total stock market index or the van Gogh total stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is a minimal I Would consider the minimal\nNot significant and they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index has either one of those up this would be a good place to start thank you\nFor the only eight year old for the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks in about four years so you have to be aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio of by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets some liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commission checked we can't make for your work is so in the market at least I Can't I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider it if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight\nIt probably would not have been the U.S and the five hundred being at eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand so making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be is is a ... activity\nUh three six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts in that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month when the three month comes to your role it into a twelve month that keeps your three six night well sequence intact\nYou're fully FDIC insured when you do this I wouldn't do it any other way fully FDIC insured\nAnd uh that way you're not taking any risk with the money because you have the icy behind you and because it's held the maturity you're guaranteed by the FDIC to get back your principal and interest or as long as you're under the insured amount so that's the approach you could take\nNo I Would not be going out into some intermediate term duration bond fund because I I think that the\nUh I personally think it's not a good thing to be doing it this time I'm not doing it I'm not recommending it and that's why I Would rather be in the shorter

concerned about with like everyone else with wise in interest rates and what it's going to be doing to the bond\nA bond fund a and a oh you're going to church in additional fun too I got an alternative to what you have in their portfolio or\nWell we really have presented three possibilities to to invest in depending on the tolerance for risk and I\nI mean we're we're always open to new ideas but frankly I think right now with the three options that we have I think we're in good shape when how we're dealing with this and either we're going to see a rise in\nIn the longer term rates or we're running an increasing risk of an inverted yield curve is that does not happen\nUh we're getting we're getting fairly close to a catch twenty two year\nWere either we have to see an increase in long term rates which many people don't want to see or we run the risk gift that keeps jacking up the federal funds rate that we could get into an area of the new ... down the road if the long rates are don't appreciate\nSo it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's going to take some time because right now there's a a decent gap\nBetween the federal funds rate and the ten year treasury rate but right now in addition to the portfolio that we publish or in the investment newsletter for a fixed income which has an average duration will Bush in one year\nIn addition to that we have two other avenues that we can go down depending on a personal preference\nOne I just mentioned that the caller is the um the CD ladder now the nice thing about the CD ladder is that uh you minimize your interest rate risk because you every three months you have a CD maturing to reinvest that the current rate\nAnd if you take a portfolio and you said it into four pieces three six nine twelve months CDs with FDIC coverage\nThen you're uh you're rolling on that basis you don't have any credit risk because you have the FDIC and uh you don't have much interest rate risk at all because you're constantly every three months you're rolling into a new CD it prevailing rich\nAnd uh another area there's some people choose to go which is fine very convenient is something like

crates\nDeflation right pressure on pricing by price discovery I see it all the time on TV I see it all the time on on on social media Twitter Facebook\nAmazon these are all mechanisms that are driving the price value doubt that act like they're stuck on the twentieth century they act like they don't know what the Internet really is\nWhen it comes to price perceptions selection and are and how it the flights continuously while they can they scream inflation like no they're they're mirage chasing group they should always I\nGot a nice pensions Hulu from their level so I I Can't believe nobody calls them out on it\n\nYeah I got this was a I got to this was the topic at the Jackson Hole meeting this year the the the deflation repression from the Internet economy is obviously very real of this is the living credit would be long upswing that we've had since two thousand nine no the exaggerated while I'm not a false while in many ways quite disappointing\nBut what's really remarkable about these how little inflation repression there is in the system you see that on the wage side as well so I agree with you as being a qualitative shift in the world economy and the last Twenty years\nInternet is part of that story which are emphasizing but I also think you have to factor in and this of course he's into connected with the into that story the role of the Chinese economy is a great manufacturing hub which is systematically pressed the cost of production down around the world\nSo this is I think changing the gaming tempted monetary policy\nAnd yet professor there's an intrinsic irony here that we would even for a moment be be thinking gee I Wish there was more inflation\n[noise] yeah well that's that's true ... on the other hand deflation is a very bad thing from

ever expanding volume of government debt\nIf you look back historically the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties when economies like us in the u._k. but the thing with the debts accumulated during World War two\nThey were paid back by very high levels of taxation they were paid back by high levels of growth\nBut a key element in the story was also inflation running somewhat ahead of interest rates\nAnd that a is a century attacks on money values\nOr which helps to distribute the cost of paying for the war in that case paying for World War two across the entire population even though he's

promising example of how things might go\nOur guest is Adam Tuesday Columbia University his new book is crashed we talk about in the program um we talk on the program at all about the fact as you will know that are in a credit driven economy\nAnd inflation is your friend in the sense that you're getting back your principal and appreciating dollars you're paying back your interest and appreciating dollars\nJust pray just briefly could you help our listeners understand a\nY ... in credit driven economy is so painful in terms of what it does to Europe for example outstanding debt\nYeah I think the best way to look at this is the housing market I think that's where most of us understand this most intimately\nAnd you take out a mortgage on the property at one of the basic questions you've got your ... in your head as do I expect the value of this real estate to go up and\nAlmost all the details of done on the basis at least that that the house will have tightened its value will probably appreciate to some moderate or perhaps great extent if you're buying in San Francisco well Manhattan or somebody like that I mean Todd basis of a deal this was\nWe'll say for the subprime bills the
