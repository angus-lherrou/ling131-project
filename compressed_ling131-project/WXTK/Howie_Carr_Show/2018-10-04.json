who produced the dodgy thought CIA so Perkins coy one of their lawyers a guy named Michael ... was feeding this made up\nDirt the smear operation they were running against Donald Trump to the FBI and the FBI was using opposition research which wasn't really research which is mostly made up stuff they made up stuff about Trump because none of it's ever been proven so it must have been made up right\nSo they they made up all this stuff and then and then the lawyers for the for Hillary Clinton handed it to the FBI and the FBI went to the secret court to get a a warrant to surveilled Carter Page and the rest of the Trump campaign and this is this is the insurance policy they were talking about\nSo even if Trump wins the election which at that time nobody thought he was gonna when they're
