another interesting story I read when I was looking for some more information on this from the\nFrom the New Hampshire papers there's a story ah I I didn't have enough ... I've never seen this this is how good the economy is in the United states and especially in places like Massachusetts New Hampshire\nThere's a pizza restaurant in Portsmouth downtown Portsmouth it's called nine hundred degrees there's actually there's several of these restaurants there's one in Manchester there's one that happening in this one in Portsmouth the owner of nine hundred degrees pizzeria stave has just announced she's closing the restaurant you know why\nNone of employees yeah she can't get enough employees she said she needs between thirty six and forty two employees to make deliveries and you know to do everything but the rest of runners required and she can't get any more than ... people because\nThere's just such a shortage of labor and she sent me the work seven days a week and she's going crazy so she just close the place she ... she just change it to four hundred and fifty degrees [laughter]\nI don't know she she said that it's so bad in Portsmouth for workers the owners of other restaurants are just coming in so the shot which she went her restaurant as open and trying to recruit people it's like it's like\nPress gangs and and the old days in Britain grabbing sailing wrapping guys off the street hitting them over the head and you wake up and you're on a ship your you've you've joined the British navy and then you get a higher\nBouncers to protect

Democrats even I I don't think they're going to have a blue wave but how did they think they're going\nHave a blue wave I mean this is if you're an employee eat this is great news isn't it ... they're they're coming into your restaurants to try to Shanghai you to go to work for their restaurants I mean that's simply we just have to start going up right they do they\nDo this this is great I think this is great news uh you know I'm I mean I'm Sorry that nine hundred degrees is closing down in the ... but still this is a this is a sign of a a a vibrant economy I Would say\nSo anyway one of the real radicals\nIn the state Democratic Party even more radical than most of the moon but Democrats that are already out there in Massachusetts is a joke Kurt atop the mayor of Somerville he ... he likes to run a a a sanctuary city in what used to be known as the all American city and so\nThey he saw the picture a on the news this ... of the ... early this afternoon of the banned by the by the fake Indian guy in a in Florida who's been arrested and charged with sending the fake bombs to the Democrats\nAnd ah so the the uh the mayor of Somerville Curtis tone is a big supporter of our local fake and the and the Elizabeth Warren the senator so why as you know the Republican who's running against the fake and the un is a Jeff deal the state rep from Whitman\nAnd uh he's a a he was the chairman of the co chairman of the Trump campaign here in in Massachusetts during the primary two years ago\nSo a credit tone the mayor of Somerville sees the a picture of the band with all the Trump paraphernalia that Mike Pence paraphernalia the CNN sucks sign on it and all this and he points out\nThat the uh the the band of the fake India and a fake bomb\nSuspect quote looks like the inside of just deals head so I bring this up only because now suppose with Hodgkinson the guy who really\nShot who really tried to kill people who who uh who who wound that it almost killed a Representative Steve skull lease and wounded another house ate at the congressional baseball practice last year the Republicans suppose when Hodgkinson\nWas shot and they confiscated his car outside that that practice the Jeff deal or what have Jeff deal supporters had tweeted out but a Hodgkin's since bad look like the inside of the fake Indians set\nYou know what they would have said they would have said that was hate speech that Jeff deal should should that denounced this guy and maybe Jeff deal should get out of the race cars how dare he compared this uh criminals actions to that of the the extinguished senator for Massachusetts the fake India\nBut of course\nThe fake India has no comment Curtis don't has no comment deal here's what deal set in a state but after a credit posted that tweet and again the tweet said that the uh the ban of the uh the the fake bombs suspect quote looks like the inside of Jeff deal set\nThis what deal set this ugly statement in regard to the sobering incidents of this week shows a lack of leadership or lack of decorum in the fundamental lack of judgment it's appalling you said that the fake Indian should condemn our colleague and supporters comments\n\nAnd by the way she's the one who was said in the past that you want it to cut\nRepublicans we have we have that sounds kind of her yesterday ethics they've a list before saying that you wanted to cut Republican just not the best quality audio there is but I think given the given the context now that we have and uh we should we should probably play the\n\nAnd I kept sorry I I didn't know was quite that bad but she said she said that Republicans should because they wanted to cut the the uh the the Affordable Care act so called and so that they should be caught in return so there it is that's I mean that's her idea\nOf a poisonous rhetoric and she wants to abolish ice although she lied at the most recent debate and said she didn't want to abolish ice even though it's it's that's on tape it's understandable\nAnd she said she just wanted to reform ice and then she said she sat down in New Orleans at the net roots not roots conference\nThat uh the the justice system was racist front to back so Jeff deal called they're out on and said why are you calling the police racist that your side never call the police racist was she did say\nThat the justice system was a racist front to back and uh I Would have to say that the police I don't I don't know if they're on the front or the back but there definitely are on one side of the other of the justice system\nSo she's she walks back her poisonous rhetoric\nBut let's see if a credit tone will walk back yes I I rather doubt it rather doubt it\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car ... new
