I used it before and it's a great stuff\nAll over it does have a little bit of a texture to it and what are reading in the product information about finishing they talk about a level five which I'm not really sure what that is a\nYou have any experience or painting finished painting is\nSo erratic at all I saw a level five painting is like\nA level five painting a level five or she brought finishing yeah\nWell maybe they talking about what will five sheet rock finished\nYeah at the levels depend on how many layers of of of joined compound and health horrifying and smooth it is yeah I I'm not I'm not I'm not positive with all the numbers are level one is probably just shaping a total mutt like if you do in a garage where you just got to tighten everything up\nRight in the mid levels to injury you know you get smoother and more more refined such probably where it's going for us this is your super smooth so when Chavez boys come in um you know everything's already smoothing just got a primary\nYeah shouldn't be paying ready ready and and but as a level five paint job is uh\nIs you know um\nIt's a very advanced very high end um paint job it's you know it's it's not it's not one primer it's two primaries um it's sending in between coats\nUm it's potentially three finished coats and I'm standing in between cause so level five paint job is um [noise]\nIt's a it's the best you can get and it's you know it's um [noise] it's a it's\nA lot more coats and it's a lot more preparation and it's a lot more um you know steps in between so did you know that's\nNot many walls I mean even walls you know um can can require more coats obvious right um but you know\nWe don't often see that though on Wall snow on on ... where where does the area or ... how big is the wall space that you're talking about\nAh well the jobs about two hundred shape so only half of it is going to be just a dense armor plus which again is really my question uh because it's got a fiberglass based on it um\nIt does have a little bit of check your to it and I'm Wondering I'm or a slow you know normal looking wall fish have you run into this before\nUh no I Would say that every you know we don't when we come into a job it's it's paint ready right in less we are preparing\nAnd if we're preparing the surface aware putting the sheet rock in or we're taking care of it we don't do that kind of sheet rock ...\nSo I I'm not I'm I think your your question would be better opposed to the the person that's installing it how they gonna finish coded for for you to uh have the finished that you you want\nOkay All right\nIs because it should be ... when they're done with it it should be paint ready\nSo all we have to do is I'm a either prime or put off in the amount of finish coach it may already be primed and we have to put the amount of finished coats at specified for contract\nRight well maybe what I should do is after it which will be probably the next week I should have your guys come over and look at this summer plus and let me know is is it is a prime ready or something else\nSure call my office and then I'll let them know your situation and uh either myself oh one of my field supervisor will come out and take a look at it\nOkay All right great All right John thank you very much but it struck by\nAre going to take a quick break and Bob in your report that we're trying hopefully ... time on the other side of break before three o'clock to get to your phone calls were getting towards the end of another edition of the hotline ...

God and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WICK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Dave Pecker President Trump says he accepts\nThe explanation offered by Saudi Arabia than Washington Post journalist ... was killed during a fight that broke out inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\n[noise] we're inviting you to send us an email at radio at ... am our financial dot com\nAnd ah give us all information about yourself and um your situation had just that you're interested in uh the participating in the portfolio make over\nWant to get a sense of your situation whether you think it's absolutely fabulous and you think you've got all the great uh choices and your portfolio and you got to design just right or if you think oh I don't know this is kinda I haven't looked at in a while and might need some help and you'd like a second set of eyes that might give you some constructive advice\nEither way what we're looking for are\nExamples of things that might be instructive to our listeners that we can draw from to talk about and share a on one of our future shows um if you want to be anonymous it will be anonymous\nBut if you want to be a participant in the program all inclusion show and we'll talk about it on the air so in any case I'm either way we'll work uh but uh if you want to participate in the portfolio make over send us an email at radio at ... am our financial dot com\nOkay so um got the boy brothers with you today I got my brother keeps boy dear um he's the um the attorney or that um we talk about every week\nWhen I and I appreciate it I really do and when I mentioned in the show up\nAnd now we're in the same office so we do share the space a year and a ... can you believe we're coming up on five years out of this location you as a as a write a though it was part of the six year six I think it's even more you know\nSo I'm On a we're right on the found that as far as the Hyannis a Centerville line on Thomas road I'm right next to CBS there in the new building ... um I don't even know the medical building or a kick a hospital\nSo I'm ten sixty fama throat happy to see you are but anyway um so um I thought it would be a good time to ... because whether you knew this or not it turns out that it is national estate planning awareness week\nDumped on on a you know so I'm stuck thought it was a good time to have a conversation about state planning and done included in our\nIn our show tell you yeah and it it is important that\nPeople take a a week and look at what they've got it and decide geez\nDoes it need a little attention is it already one on a limb and say I bet a lot of people didn't know that that is a national estate planning ... wearing a sweet kid ends tomorrow I'm so [laughter]\nBut it's not letting it in under the law not too late you can still or take a look at your plan review things you know that's on honestly is probably one of the biggest things I see\nThat people fail to do which is what\nTheir brand new it yeah just to take a step back in\n... so many people will think\nOh I've got my state plan I you know I saw my lawyer ten years ago and I'm going to stick it up on the shelf and and it's done I don't have to worry about it so that was sort of changed my ... I still have the same kids right at the same kids I've picked the same executor the same ... everything's good I don't have to touch any what's wrong with that thinking\nWell let's see there was a big tax change law that was started this year there are\nA techniques that are different uh and and if you\nYou know if you if you're not using a trust maybe you should be if you're a naming your kids as beneficiaries of your IRA after the death of you and or your spouse\nMaybe you shouldn't really not that I don't want your kids to not get the IRA benefits yeah what do you have against my kids and I and I love your kids yet right\nAh but you know we what we want to do is make sure that whatever you're going to give them stays with them so maybe naming a trust instead ... maybe if the kids are doing well you should not attacks amount to find him the trust [noise]\nNo not not not so what here's the thing\nYou know that there's a difference between changing the ownership of your retirement account mhm and trying to put your IRA four one K. directly into your trust while you're still alive that would be a tax event we don't do that right\nBut to name a trust as the beneficiary of that retirement plan\nThat's okay that's not a tax of it\nAnd then the trust can name the kids or the grandkids as beneficiary of the trust\nAnd now you get to have some ask for protection with the right kind of trust and if it's built the right way you can have the ability to let the air's take what's called a stretch out take it out so so you know this this is a great opportunity one of the things the biggest opportunity for wealth creation is probably dealing with retirement plans\nAnd naming the right beneficiaries as beneficiary of a trust\nA if for example if you can skip the kids if the kids are doing well and they don't need whatever's going to be left in the IRA four one K. for three be whatever it is a name of the grandkids\nBecause they're that much younger you know by our Thirty years younger than the kids that means they have thirty more years that that money can grow inside the tax deferred or tax free IRA yeah yeah and that means they're going to get maybe you know two or three times as much money as the kids would get\nYou know when you ... you know just as as an example of the kids typically with an IRA will get\nOh I don't know about twice as much money as what it's worth on date of death by taking what's called the stretch out taking a minimum distribution every year yeah if you named the grandkids they typically get five times the day to death value over their lifetime by taking it out slowly wow that's a huge wealth creation opportunities\nYou know let's put it amazing yeah and and most people think I'm going to spend all my IRA and if you're only taking the minimum distribution and that's because it's stretched out over so much longer and their exasperation requirement of smaller on the outside and that's ... that's right\nYou know so I I'm I'm I'm not these numbers are not accurate but just to give you an example you know if you're leaving something to a fifty year old they might take out one forty fifth and then the next year one forty fourth in the year after that one forty third of whatever the balance is you know if you name a thirty year old\nThey might take out a one sixty fifth\nAnd then one day before or something and where is the author or something like that so it's a much smaller amount\nWhich leaves the rest inside that tax deferred or tax favor vehicle of an IRA four one K. for three B it's it's one of the most overlooked planning techniques that's out there and so many people we see are still just naming the kid says the beneficiary after mom and dad and and it's a lost opportunity\nSo it's really something that uh you know it's something we should encourage you if you're doing that little review during national estate planning weight rice to make sure you're thinking about how should you update your beneficiary designation when you do review of your plan you want to look at are the people you've picked is your\nAge I mean that's something we talk about radio as part of our yeah review process as well as just you know when we had a couple in here the other day who didn't have kids you know and um\nThey have each other ... beneficiaries but it's like well who do you want to have to\n... [laughter] and I don't know ... how how does a lot actually frequently when we have that situation right um but so that was just one more reminder of well you might want to at least put it on the form of who we let's give that thought so come back and let us know you know\nBut I'm Sorry I didn't mention you know it's okay but it's kind of thing than regular thing you have to review and make sure I got it up to date\nYou know we had a situation a few years ago where a gentleman passed away and he had some life insurance and nobody had any record of the beneficiary in life insurance and he was a eighty eight I think when he passed away\nI think I've heard the story yeah and so ah we wrote to the insurance company said yeah the gentleman's passed away or you know we need to help the family make a claim who did the who did he nemesis beneficiary yeah and it turned out it was his mother who had died Thirty years before him [laughter]\nAh so you know you've got an update these beneficiary designated a time to time you know what happened in that situation is that require probate oriented in that case it did require appropriate because there was no other backup beneficiary to mom and so that meant it just went into his probate estate which means nobody got those life insurance benefits for almost a year\nBecause they'd have we had to go through a process of court process a period where creditors can make claims against the the the assets of the state and the the assets of appropriate estate or centrally\nNot available to the IRS for almost a year\nSo you know it's it's it was unfortunate but you know it's\nJust it's a great illustration you have the how though yeah\nAnd insurance policies I think are easier to sometimes forget yeah I'm old work plans mhm\nThat ah you know you have maybe a collected a series of four one K. is along the way or whatever it might be ethically and you've kind of forgotten that your ex wife is your beneficiary of you know for his land or whatever you know that kind of thing\nWe had another case a similar similar idea where a a there was a retirement plan that um\nThe beneficiary designation had been lost by the oh the custody of her yeah and so they're saying now that has to go through probate fortunately we had a copy of whatever fishery but as a nation\nNot only had it been submitted but it'd been returned to us saying here's what we have on file so we had a letter from the company saying this is ... so we're able to get the ... which is good fortune but again this is so important to review these to find out\nFerret over as of right now and uh that it's nine months and then it can be extended for another six months if an extension for the federal state tax returns timely filed\nBut the idea behind this what does that called portability portability of the ideas that can move that ten million from the deceased spouse to the surviving spouse and that's a good idea it really should be done far more than it is being done\n... here's why Congress can change the exemption again and in fact historically Congress has already repealed the estate tax not once not twice or three times\nPermanently revealed it but not so far I'm In LA and then they go and reenact it yeah so now we have a a a temporary eleven point one eight million dollar exemption yeah\nBut will it stay there will they will it expire and go back to five and a half million will Congress lower at from eleven million or five and a half million down at some point in the future to three million or write one million dollars\nAnd all the sudden that unused exemption Kennedy saving hundreds of thousands of dollars\nIn federal estate taxes so are there things I mean I imagine most of our listeners um aren't concerned about their eleven million dollar you know ... hours yeah us less than one half of one percent of the entire population will do for those who may have um\nNumbers that are bigger than what the estate tax may eventually become as a you know changes over time you\nAre are there things that they should be doing in the process that just do this process of portability certainly lacked portability though in the first spouse dies just in case you know later on the rules are different exactly okay\nAnd that alone can save hundreds of thousands of dollars because historically the estate tax has been up around fifty five percent on the states are as high and once you hit the million dollars you're in the fifty five percent rate of his uh previously right now the reach forty percent\nOn anything over the you know any ... any estate that's taxable uh by the federal level yeah what if you you bump it back down to you know old rules you could be looking at rates from you know mid thirties up to mid fifties and percentages\nYeah ... percent thirty five percent up to fifty five percent of tax on the excess over the exception but that's a huge hit to a family and I think it'd be completely avoided if portability was elected if a death occurred one portability is an option\nSo it it's a really good idea now there's other things that can be done so it's it's not to say that this is the only white but this is a really simple thing to do and it's an opportunity that's being forgotten by many families because\nThey don't get the advice they don't hire an attorney they tried to do it themselves and all of that can be done but you're missing the opportunity and so getting some advice and counsel on whether or not to do a bill in order to do other things can be really helpful [noise] anyway to just\nBefore you leave that do um you know does the state have some measure of portability or you know like right here about a difference between federal and spray\nSo that that might you know the federal exemption is we just said is no eleven point one eight million it's a temporary exemption that goes away in twenty twenty six and will return to in indexed inflation ... I'm Sorry indexed for inflation figure based on five million dollars so my guess is around six or seven million dollars yeah a passion and twenty twenty six\nI'm Massachusetts does not have indexed\nA exemption about it is one million dollars per person and that's it\nSo a married couple in concept could pass two million dollars if they do things right there is no portability on the Massachusetts the exemption there's to my knowledge only one state that has portability that's Maryland\nA so Maryland residents do have an ability to to forge a unused state exemption\nBut the uh Massachusetts residents do not have portability of elbow for the unused million dollar exemption so its use it or lose invested juices are and so that means you really want to consider using it in the way your state plans developed so you have the option to use it\nNow most of the state plans if people had done what's traditionally called a B or ABC planning you know you had an ab trust or an ABC trust is used in Massachusetts often um\nThose trust often force estate tax planning\nForce it what do you mean but uh so uh there's a trust for the husband the\nTrust for the wife husband dies first whatever's in husbands trust becomes irrevocably and has divided into these state exemption amounts of the first million dollars are typically goes into what's called the sea share\nA the balance the federal exemption would go into the beef share and if there's anything over the federal exception that goes into the ... a share a\nI'm not everyone will understand that but that's fine it was a very bad why they hire right oh so you know but if that has to happen whatever's in a sharing the beach Cher does not belong to the surviving spouse does not get a step up and basis when the survivor dies\nAnd there are many situations where we're seeing that forced into a state tax planning as are important objective we've picked the wrong tax husband dies\nSurviving spouse lives another ten or Fifteen Years yeah the assets could health issues and can be pretty substantial and now you know you didn't the surviving spouse hasn't sold those asks the real estate maybe it's a particular stock holding that they've had the river and now the kids are inheriting that\nBut they're inheriting it at the data death value of the first to die back Fifteen Years or whatever or you know and now they've got this big capital gains tax okay yeah we've saved the estate tax but the capital gains tax could be more than the estate tax [noise]\nUm the rate of a capital gains taxes generally\nRelatively low it's lesser rate well done and not necessarily ... because there's this ... than a million dollars or rights ... irrevocably trusts and you know the uh let me say that differently if we start with a revoke ... trust\nThat becomes irrevocably when this the person who created it dies traditional planning will make that trust a separate tax payer\nAnd that trust will be in the highest income tax bracket if it hasn't come over twelve thousand five hundred dollars it will be in the highest capital gains bracket if it hasn't come over twelve thousand seven hundred dollars it will be in the uh subject to the Affordable CARE Act surtax\nIf it hasn't come over and read or write if it hasn't come over twelve thousand five hundred dollars so you're affective capital gains rate on trust on capital gains in most trust will be up around thirty percent when you add the state five point one percent capital gains rate into the equation so you got a twenty percent capital gains rate\nA three point eight percent surtax on a five point one percent state income tax you're up close to thirty percent yeah and so reviewing a trust because of the new tax law\nThere are provisions that can be put in to lower those tax bracket and save about nine percentage points of tax rate\nYou know to go from almost thirty to go back down to about twenty ... and but it's it's and it's a relatively simple thing to build into the trust but you have to have somebody planning for that and to put that language into the trust\nSo that we're not paying those high income tax rates anymore okay so that's one of the ... and understanding and tax work and for ... review of the document with a plan or who has understood\nThat it's not all about estate taxes anymore\nThat a state tax another oriented you ... a plan and know any of the right kind of a ... works needs to be structured a little bit differently with these kind of concerns in mind that's right your plan has to be planning not just for income I'm Sorry not just for state taxes but also for income tax has got to do both\nYeah it's got to make use of an optional not forced it needs to make the income tax planning the most efficient possible that has to be looking for opportunities to get base to step up at every chance we can get ...\nWe have to be able to have flexibility in the plan because guess what taxes are going to change after you die and if your trust is stagnant you can't change it now you got a problem\nWe want to be able to have your ... to to be able to be amended or maybe even ... can't it after the trust becomes irrevocably so these are all the things that we're seeing because of the new tax law we want to make sure that our clients or families who are planning with us or looking at these issues\nTo make sure that uh we're we're getting the right tax result\nOkay wow [laughter] [noise]\nIt's a little out at you in just a short time yeah that's very interesting though a lot a lot to uh to it but it makes the point that this was the kind of thing that\nUm it's not stagnant things change you need to keep a refreshing I'm Lisa in our office a shared us that that um six and ten Americans don't have even a will yeah\nAlone I'm you know with a full stay plan with um well what would some of the general documents be that one should have as\nPart of their stay plan or I Would say that you do a couple of simple things first you know for medical decision making you need healthcare proxy ...\nOr the the trust oftentimes become irrevocably and at that point we can help the family settled the affairs you know figure out what's in the trust what what isn't in the trust how does it pass\nA there's a lot of paperwork it takes about a year typically to settle someone's affairs\nOr sometimes a year and a long time it does and uh you know it's not that work is being done every day uh it's sometimes just very often times sometimes to get a ... you write a letter to the investment house to say you know change so and so's past what I Need to change the title\nAnd they don't get back to you for a month with here at the forms and uh sometimes it's a you know we need information and it takes them a little time to process it then we send the forms back to them tapes a little time to process we have to send the forms to the client ... to sign something back and so\nYou know sometimes the clients or you know parts of the country other than locally here on the Cape right because the kids one of the kids whose nominated as the trustee is located in California so we're fixing things back and forth\nAnd they're doing it on the weekend when they have time because they're working during the week and I'm actually happy by Louis weekend so right till next we exactly or whatever or so and I forgot that was there yeah so you know it's it's it's not that everybody's dragging feed on it it just it's a process and it takes time\nAnd so we help families get through that and what we like to say we're taking the burden of the family or you know it was a job and so I was hospital relies on much work is involved with him or you know ... unless they've gone through the process themselves when\nA parent or something right on through it already there there's a lot of work there's a lot of liability you know one of the kids in most kids get along well but the you know every so often their kids that\nAre you know feel one kids taking advantage not sharing information\nUh and and so you end up with litigation just to a head on that every so often is it isn't it really more often than you'd like to think it would be a you know in all honesty I have to I have to praise my clients yeah they've raised a lot of great kids or you know we don't run into it as often as I think the norm\nI guess you have a bad story stick out in your mind yeah they are my body out of it that makes me think oh I bet it just seems like it happens more than\nYeah it it does how even you know ... there's a few cases every year you know uh so you know it happens but it it's it mostly we want to keep the trustee or whoever's in charge out of trouble and in holding their hand in guiding them to say you can't do it this way but you can do it that way yes\nProbably five or ... or when you're doing the planning I don't know if you include this as a regular part or encourage people to include this was a regular part but when you do on the trust you can um include a provision that says hey if you can test all this stuff right you're out yeah\nI ... I I usually include what's called a no contest provision they're valid in Massachusetts Florida does not recognize them do right it's against public policy but the basic laws says if you can test to say you should get more than the trust says you should get\nAnd uh if you file a court case and you lose you lose your inheritance yeah ah we've actually had the British Rule to things to say you if if you when you still have to play pay the trust expenses so everybody else shouldn't be ...\nNow that doesn't set that doesn't mean that a beneficiary can't say I don't think the trustees doing something right ... they're still allowed to do that the no contest cause does not for their own benefit type right to say how I'm being I should be getting a bigger percentage ... essentially that's right\nUm so back to more than ... thing that we do inside the planning administration is trust these services\nUh every so often the family doesn't have the right person to be in charge\nI mean we see that I'm pretty regularly I mean all the time but you where you know\nParents love their kids they want to leave them resources but they're just not confident that they are really good with money mhm or that they make good decisions when it comes to how to deal with the money or that there to execute the plan they had intended right and so that's maybe ... ... when tends to be are there other occasions to\nAn asset protection reasons because of national needs ... so if you had an independent trustee it's very hard for credit or or divorcing spouse to reach into a trust with the independent trustee cause the independent trustee is going to say no we're not making a distribution yeah and so it's discretionary so there's times when that can be very helpful\nUm is special needs situations a substance abuse situations uh you know it's just there's a number of cases where a just putting a child in charge even though you love the child dearly is the wrong thing to do\nA sometimes is because the kids don't get along and if you pick one year's got no matter who you pick your going to World War three between the kids didn't rise and that can be irreparable harm in their relations family dynamic in riot just save some headache from\nHaving that kind of a war I think that that's a little bit predictable not always but yeah and sometimes it's it's for the benefit of the surviving spouse to uh you know the surviving spouse needs some help and so having a professional involved can be a way of getting that helped\nTo very good well if people want to learn more about boy boy during national estate planning awareness week uh or they want a ton of your seminars a ... they have an opportunity to talk with you a check you out on the Web right visit our website\nBoyd and Boyd PC dot com V.

R. news radio Ninety five W. H. D. J. [noise]\n\nYeah so so proud of mentally it matters it at the levels of national values\nBecause John or me or Jim Clapper a road they denied something we would otherwise be entitled to and we would be denied it because of political speech now that\nYou know when you put it that way I I think most Americans to go whoa wait a minute [laughter] because I mean that's I think most Americans will be very very uncomfortable so that's something that that that's\nOne I think important aspect no I understand the president's peek a summer of last year I think John is the best example have been pretty sharpen their language I I Try to stay the fact witness but I'm I'm sure I'm not always a plot it in the west wing either [laughter]\nAnd and so I I I I get the the emotion on the part of the president did you just gotta understand although he has some forty to do that is what he's doing with that absolutely Saudi is what I just described that I think we can get otherwise entitled to because\nBecause of our political speech at the level of practicality it it won't change my life for John life for Jim Clapper if I if we were to lose our Clarence is in fact I was actually kind of done an inventory of okay if I lose my clearance what happens\nAnd the most I can come up with the most predictable result is\nWell I guess I won't be doing those pro bono classified lectures I've been doing for the for the agency and for the air force a couple of times a year [noise]\nBecause I Would no longer be allowed into the environment\nTo think that the president is intending to um uh try to have a financial threat to someone or like try to run into I think that there'll be less um\nReadily sawed by the television shows uh you know the Sunday shows or whatever I Know that they are lacking not finance a clearance kind of thing\nIf if if that's what he faked it very well may be Chris what he thinks that that that is an absolutely distorted view of reality none of us use our\nClearances or to to help us sound smarter than we would otherwise silent on on TV I mean we don't\nAnd I don't stop by Langley on the latest CNN and rights of my old files so that I can say something intelligent none of us whatever I don't even call the age and and say I did some background on X Y or Z I'm ... it in fact it is far easier for us\nNumber one that's a good thing to do but he also would be a stupid thing to do because we don't have the license to reveal America America secrets right on on national TV and why would I Want to confuse myself\nWith you know what level my ...\nYeah yeah\nAnd what little doesn't um [laughter] before I go before I go on the air and it just defies a defies went out with or it could have a more\nSubstantive impact on you know making money with\nBecause we have the clearance is ... is our presence on boards who really do because these companies have classify contracts they won at least some of their board members to average clearances mhm uh in my personal case may never I suggested a minute\nAgo I did a personal inventory how this would affect me and my personal case it would have no effect on me at all and so [noise] um [noise] again\nI mean let me let me and somewhat the way I began John Brennan my case Jim Clapper and others have these clearances because the government of the United states thinks it's a good idea for the government of the United states for us to have these clerics\nRight how how does it help or institutional continuity um to have ah people like self um maintain those security clearances like you mentioned pro bono talks to measure up to the military and so forth but\nIs there also do retain some involvement institutional involvement in the organizations that you've been a part of so\nWe're on level is is Gina Haspel calls me I'd I'd go in there at the speed of light because all former directors that to the current director and I have been called by directors [noise]\nCan you kinda can they chat with me about this I Need to understand whether this is new or just new to me does that happen yeah\nYeah good that sounds like it should [laughter] good\nThing for America yeah yeah you um how do you think the uh the new uh\nDirectors are doing I mean it's and others the new director at a relatively uh both the CIA and the NSA organizations who blood I imagine you probably don't go around saying oh they're doing a terrible job you know\nBut All right right but they but they are out there actually a poll knack of Sony whom I Know more by reputation\nAnd personally as the new head of an essay and I I I I think he was a wonderful choice very strong choice or Gina Haspel the director of CIA was a more controversial choice but they but Chris you realize that the former senior leadership of the CIA under\nBush or Obama Trump and Clinton 'em all ... all supported\nGina as the best available choice to be direct\nCurrent yeah yeah a lot of well let's let's step back from the particulars of that issue which you know I'm Glad I appreciate your commenting on 'cause I just felt that that was um you know I was pretty controversial I'm pretty I I think you know agree just we don't want to be going down that path of political retribution\nRight um but I you know maybe just give us a a doctor up what do you see is like where\nDo you think this administration is a ... you know when it comes across as being much more impulsive and so forth\nIs that really the way things are being done behind the scenes or is it more just the president's you know demeanor and kinda portrayal of things\nI I I I actually think it's um it it is it is\nIt is more instinctive rather than strategic\nA more more transactional than than long term and and uh I think that's that's unfortunate I mean just the nature of your questions suggest is the one is more desirable\nA them up so that we have the head and like I like to be fair to the\nThe current guys it's hard I mean we've got so many areas have contact with the Chinese out were were were mad at them about our our trade relationship were mad at them because of the the sand castles they've built in the south China Sea you're\nOn the other hand we need them um because our economy user code depend on the other hand we need them because we need their help with North Korea I mean do you see the complexity\nJob suing absolutely um\nTo go back to the topic of immigration just to you and tied down to find the three you know things that you know where you are within our um\nOur own society and you know some of those these pillars that we've built a on and maybe are questioning [noise] um I thought Tom Friedman a you know who's will more liberal than you know I'm ... typically it would be but ah I thought he had a great phrase where he said we want 'em\nWant a great big wall was a great big door or something along those lines I Know what I mean like you want to be able to control people coming in but you you want or if you want immigration coming in I thought that was one of the right length in the country yeah it\nRight and we and unfortunately we turned the immigration question and to a nativist Django list\nBlood and soil chats rather rather than I'm recognizing that as a sovereign nation we can control the entry into our country but as the American sovereign nation\nImmigration is a strategic advantage that makes us younger and more entrepreneurial than we would otherwise be\nYeah and you know a A R shows generally a financial program\nAnd you know I don't think people recognize how essential that in the immigration plays a role in the expansion of our economy because of growing demographics and write those other concerns consideration to just identified\n'em maybe it just died last kind of a a I don't know how much do you if you are running short on time we can let you go to one other thing I was interested in talking about if if not now at another time was the uh the question of\nUm when it comes to things like you mentioned cyber security earlier um and you know the whole thing with the Russian involvement and Facebook and so forth\nUm how much of our current unrest admitted you think is fermented by uh you know the ... foreign powers or whatever it might be trying to you know encourage this kind of like we have a very\nA lot of civil unrest a lot of tension in certain ways um how much that you think is like organic and how much that is fermented\nOkay pure pure Kentucky when did your breasts are I just you know all my thumb up through the window air yeah\nTry to judge 'em let me give you some numbers that I actually use that she actually talk\nAbout this and some public presentations and the numbers might surprise you [noise] eighty percent of distance us twenty twenty ... twenty percent of this is the Russia's\nOkay so it's kind of our own our own our own issues just by a and and and the twenty percent\nOf the Russians become high leverage only because of the eighty percent of us yeah yeah\nThat's discouraging [laughter] yeah [laughter] ... yes I Do to fix to yeah well how would how would that would that look like what what are your game\nAnd it's our political discourse it's it's it's an appeal to our better angels rather than our darker Rangel's it's it's it's the senior leadership of the country hitting upon themes that pool west together rather than on themes that inherently divided I'll give you I'll give you one\n... that really shows how this we're sorry I remember the president's speech a year ago in Huntsville, Alabama ... it was about taking the with the NFL is yeah yeah yeah real really really harsh right\nUm you know they called him SOB accepted it used abbreviations 'em\nBefore before the president gets\nTo the east coast that night the three leading hashtags on Russian box or taking they take the knee and NFL\nMhm and and the Russians are playing both ends tastes great less filling a you've got to be that you're adding you got for free speech may they don't have a dog in the fight they just want us to argue\nYeah then those names are picked up by the outright media a infowars gateway funded Alex Jones and so on they take it racial pretty fast because of the demographics of the NFL you know\nAnd then it bleed from the outright media maybe not with all this racial content with bleach and the outright media to mainstream media largely through Fox News\nThe president sees it on Fox News on Fox and friends in the morning tweets just supportive and now I've got a complete circle do not\nKnow back to the whole process all over again\nAnd and none of that none of that as coal lose its convergence everybody does it for the wrong reasons the president to feed the base the Russians to mess with our heads\nThey All right 'cause they're conspiratorial and Fox for ratings demographics right what we what we end up a more divided country than we would otherwise be over frankly Chris an issue that is really stupid [laughter]\nAll right I Know there were ... they\nWould effectively are in a respectful way to protest a voice protest to\nThe weekend the weekend before the president's speech all thirty two teams played it wasn't the burden into the Bible you can jet\nFifty three athletes for team you do the math it's about Seventeen hundred Americans ... up to play for the NFL yeah the number the number that did not stand at attention for the national anthem appreciating Sunday was six yeah give me a break\nRight and I was not not exactly a national a concern right\nBut what we gave the Russians and opportunity to divide us further because of our own divisions in our own political culture at the moment\nYou know I was talking with um a relative who said well I'm I'm sending a shock\nTo the whoever runs against um the senator from Maine a because she didn't vote a down the um the the to Kavanaugh um appointment and you know my point was you know maybe you want to vote for someone who is far more like\nExtreme shoot cause she's kind of in the middle you know I mean more through the ...\nYou know maybe there's somebody else you'd rather oppose than you know anyway\nUm because we keep getting more and more polarized and the ... you know but anyway a general Hayden um thank you so much for making the time I appreciated hope we didn't keep for too long a great thank you always

journalists who disappeared um and then a collect\nTell go go out this again you guys are all over this earlier oh go ahead Brian you go first well\nStock market and have a good reaction to it um I'll say that and I think it was really about this the markets were moving while I Know that specific sectors of the market certainly moved it definitely move\nThe oil prices um it definitely move the ... that makes sense rates on certain transportation ... a cost within the the oil industry which hurt\nCertain certain trench it in ... stocks and things like that and um but if it's going on I I Do think it has is having an impact on stocks just in general because if you have a oil supply shock and Saudi Arabia due to sanctions or something like\nA gear that oil is going to go up in price significantly which is essentially a big tax on the U.S consumer\n[noise] um where the U.S um control so much of its I mean I was thinking we're going to talk more about this this whole deal but this is great as more investment oriented um where the U.S has 'em so much output now of its own energy and ultimately\nCould could produce more as if it was desirable um could could be I don't know how long it takes to ramp up but does something like that seem like a long term concern or even you know there are sanctions and there was a shock as you put it is not likely to be temporary anyway\n[noise] I I Would say that it would be less bad then it would have been the thirty years' ago right I'm ... and do you really think that uh that's really where this how did I mean it doesn't seem like\nThere's the political uh will clicks coming from the White House to ah\nPursue sometime [noise] yeah I mean I've\nDirection I have trouble predicting what Donald Trump would do but uh other countries in the world certainly seem adamant about something from doing something hearing list on\nCentral Hayden mentioned earlier it turns out some of the uh um our allies being pretty direct with some of their response pretty rapidly\nAnd it's the allies have any influence over the White House at all I could see some kind of response ah one thing I've seen written in the newspaper a lot which I don't think I'm\nWill be a concern is the fact of Saudi Arabia on like a hundred and sixty eight billion dollars what the us debt [noise]\nAh first of all that's not that much [laughter] it might it might seem like a lot but there's over twenty million dollars that standing in the U.S debt and second of all they need to hold that that in order to support their currency in local economy most likely so I'm yet don't don't worry about them off loading security so that'll be\nPunishing themselves um even further I think [noise]\nUm but what I Want to kind of get back to the the what I think would happen if they had some kind of response I'm too [noise]\nGuy I think the oil side\nLoyal buyers a road I\nLike I said I Would go off\nWagon ... obviously for here that uh kept safe\nTo fight on

weeks away\nFor so much of D.C has been consumed by the disappearance of democracy ... and how Americans responded to possible transgressions by one of its top allies we talked about all of it was ABC News devotee political director ... tell me how the gym all cause showed this story has been playing out politically across the country\nIt's hard to imagine that a voter is going to cast their vote in Eighteen days on this issue\nAlone but I've been surprised\nAt our old polling that the issue of rooting out corruption in Washington is increasingly important to American voters in our latest poll it was ranked third ahead at eating taxes and immigration so as much as this story starts to look more and more like\nA sketchy starts to look like the president is more concerned with an arms deal I can\nThe voters thinking at all just looks too swampy and they're very interested in trading swamp\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich shy was a Trump ally and said this week that Republicans should be focusing on two things this metro cap it off and caravan now those definitely play to the base but what about everybody else very off\nRight there is no longer a primary this as a general election and all those two issues do you play the Republican base\nOur experiences that they play just as much the Democratic base as well you have to remember this is the year where we have a lot of first type female candidates at brand new female voters\nWho are specifically inspired to get involved in American politics in response to this president uh their butt\nOut mobilizing energizing and making sure that you people are registered to vote so while those issues can be good for bringing out Republican voters they can be good for bringing that democratic voters to and they're not the kinds of issues that the middle of the country or moderates in the country are excited to talk about\nWhat are those in the middle part of the country excited to talk about\nHealth care health care and jobs and the economy um it is remarkable not only in our old holy but also\nAnecdotally when we're out in the states how often the issue of health care comes up everything from the rising cost of prescription drugs to confusion over the healthcare market frustration that premiums are still up out and and a lot of distrust that Washington is actually doing anything that making those that she better\nWhen you talk about health care whether is those things you mentioned or younger people who are going from job to job that is something that we in the media just don't talk about is it\nNo it it's not as flashy it's not as simple as sort of interesting viral video it these are complicated question health insurance markets in what makes them go up or down how you protect them all with

people's lives right now when wages have still felt stagnant for a lot of people\nAre a few hundred dollars increased every month or over a year in their health insurance can really make or break the bank\nOkay so final question if the Democrats do take the house there's a lot of people are thinking that they might how come the prediction is that we won't be talking about health care from twenty Nineteen we'll be talking about subpoenas for the Trump campaign\n[noise] that's interesting I think Democrats are going to have to find a way to to walk and chew gum if they want to govern ... there are a lot of Democrats both here in Washington and around the country that are interested in some of those the peanut interested in in\nIn running proper investigation I'm at about\n... administration

myself maybe it's about her and her search dog social\nAnd their mission to save people in Colorado during avalanches old is she was undergoing some very personal struggles of her own room I spoke to her about her memoir and how ... help save many lives looting hers view and your\nSearch and rescue dog talk show that's really what the story is about it's about the relationship between you and ... and what you've done give us a little bit about what led you to adopt and then train cautious\nI must say gold exploration geologist with my husband working in the Dominican Republic and we were looking for gold there and we can live anywhere so we chose to land in the last great Colorado each town which has to be a Colorado\nAnd at the time I didn't know that something was missing in my life I didn't really care about ... searching for gold I didn't care about money I needed something bigger and better to do\nSo I kind of mid west decided I'm going to be a ski patrol where\nAn honest gnarly ski mountain not knowing anything really about avalanches and when I was in the patrol school I learned an avalanche that happened across the street and the ski resort that buried for toddlers I sorry three toddlers there for four and six years old\nAnd the local avalanche dog deployed to the scene\nBut failed to find the children were when I kept asking them well wait a minute isn't that the dogs the only job is to find human how come the dog failed the answer I got wasn't good enough\nAnd that night when I was walking into no storm I decided I Wonder I could train adopt save a life and I bought you never leave anyone behind\nSo what was the reason that they gave you a wide search and rescue dogs wouldn't work so well in snow\nWell and they had to change the avalanche that I don't know I mean to this day okay to the scene has complicated there was a lot of people and seen but I\nKnow the answer I got wasn't good enough and I don't know if they could answer it maybe they didn't train enough maybe they weren't really as good as they thought they were and I don't know even to this day because I had to let that go but I said I Will never let that happen on my watch and I set out to train the best possible search dog and\nIn our career that even though I didn't know even how to take care of a house plant let alone a puppy and I was commuting back and forth we you know turned out to be one of the top teams in Colorado to call in the\nExtreme and buy or mental condition because we were really good at what we did\nYeah tell me a little bit about some of those the

line\nFrom ABC News I'm Sherry ... you say I Want to buy\nA house but is now the right time John Hancock kind of device of innovation the doorbell Dario ... about how big banks are offering at that'll tell people budget long term investment and new home\nThe majority of people do in fact I Want to be homeowners now fifty one percent of people think that owning a home is the best investment you can make Seventy three percent agree that it's an important financial miles down\nThe first step is that down payment and that is a major road block for a lot of people\nThat can be in and it can be really daunting because\nYou know for somebody who is you know relatively young and it's just getting started with their financial I it would be the largest single sum of money that they probably put into anything on their own their education office they cost money but it gets spread out and their parents or ... or they take out loans so\nTo think about coming up with ten twenty thirty forty thousand dollars and gas little loan if they if you live in a coastal city it's even multiples of that\nAs a down payment can be daunting but yet not on achievable\nSo what do you do if if you know you need to you want to buy a home you know you want to take that step it but but you just look at the down payment you said that is just an achievable unattainable what do you do\nTo you know the first thing that I Would suggest is just doing a research\nUnderstanding what it is that you do need it you know maybe\nIn your head you think you need fifty thousand dollars but maybe there's a way to get into a house or twenty thousand dollars you know I put eight thousand dollars a month first oh so there are opportunities and there are more good programs that you could potentially take advantage of it\nAnd thinking about you know not just taking a rule of thumb from a national average but think about where you live and what the cost of living in your area is to make sure that you're identifying the right amount\nOh so you need and then it starts to get into just budgeting and getting started one of the themes we always cautious part of our efforts is to say there's no time like the president to just get started the only guarantee you that you don't start you won't get\nThere how long that normally take for people to come up with that ten percent minimum that they need people\nAre realizing that they have to play it out for it they\nDon't expect to sort out the thing the overnight but don't want to necessarily be a gold is going to happen in ten or Twenty years so we really do try to give them a tool and and we've built into trying a calculator that helps people to understand given the amount of money that you can set aside on a weekly or monthly basis\nAnd given the target goals that you are whether it is ten twenty thirty thousand dollars how long will that\nAnd then we also give them a sense of is there a benefit is there a pro unconscious taking in and if it is a five to seven year time period\nMaybe thinking about investing the money and and seeing if there's a a benefit to doing that in the middle a on a conservative investment portfolio but even if it helps to save you six months than we think there might be it's a work at least six words\nAre there other things that you should do before you make the down payment like say your credit card debts have other kinds of debt you should get that cleared up first strike\nAnd a little motley comes down to each couples unique goals in life how important is\nHomeownership to you and and your family you know self concept that could be that if you waited till the quote unquote perfect moment in my ... and so for some families\nIt is worth it to say you know we're we're ever growing family we need to move into a house and we're willing to spend a little bit longer to pay all this other debt in order to achieve this financial dream for ourselves and for other people they might feel like they need to have a little bit more\nA level of comfort in order to be able to take on that type of obligation 'cause as we know there is paying for the house and then there's maintained about so there's always more to go\nAbsolutely and you do mention that there is no perfect a moment in and if you wait for that perfect moment you're going to be waiting for ever how easy is it to get a mortgage these days I Know that the economy has improved credits loosened up on the edge but not a lot but that working pretty hard to obtain for a lot of people\nIt can be and certainly I think that goes without saying that it's harder than it was ten years ago but I think it is something that if you do your research and if you do you're planning and if you've taken positive steps in your financial life to have good credit that it's something that is very achievable for most families\nSteve door of all the head of advice and innovation for John Hancock on how the app that he helped

rabies the News I'm Sherry ...\nNews radio Ninety five WICK\n[noise] the news all the way to your own hunting\nUs teachers [noise]\n\n\n\nYou know most of these pensions you understand pensions have to be funded so they have to be funded by the employer okay whether it's you know the government funding into whether it's a big corporation who's funding it right so about Fifteen Years ago Ninety two percent of these pensions were funded fully funded\nToday it's sixty eight percent an old bottle a Massachusetts\nOnly sixty two point three percent of the pensions of funded and we're ranked thirty six in the country while not\nNot too great so what what happened what happened well obviously two thousand they took it took a big effect rice um none of these took a big hit and it's tough to recover low interest rates have really rocked\nPensions because most pensions invest in bars you know uh because they want to be somewhat safe with the money is because they have a future obligation to fund\nWell if the interest rates are way down and more and more people are retiring and more money's going out the door it creates a problem writing so that's a problem bad management okay I'm with low rates of return\nSome of these pension managers of forced to take a little more risk to try to get the return to try to meet obligations and of course with more risk comes potentially more reward but it also can turn the other way and caused pensions to be underfunded and and possibly go bankrupt and with government pensions [laughter]\nA lot of the problem is that the investment decisions fall and politicians and not financial professionals that's kind of a problem so\nWith that when I talk to my article about boom or bust I talked about that stolen I talked about basically how do we solve this problem if you um\nHave a pension right and you're retired mhm it is what it is right you have it you're lucky and hopefully whoever you're with is doing a decent job and you can rely on that check but if you're not quite at retirement yet\nAgain you have a pension you need to understand that you got to make some choices with that pension and most of it falls on what I refer to as the ABCs of Hank and what I mean by that is\nAuction a as taking the biggest check you can and essentially just inheriting your spouse and children okay now why that may sound like a terrible idea it might be good if you can apply certain things to it so ... is that way be might give\nHalf the check to your spouse and see might give two thirds but as you suspect as a price you pay for that so if you go from eight to see you might have to give up eight to ten percent of your check\nTo provide the survivor benefit so well yeah but you know what you're doing just that you're what you're doing is you're buying life insurance that's exactly what you're doing you're paying a premium to provide a survivor interest too so the question becomes a you're better off\nIt through your company or are you better off doing it privately and I've done many many meetings with this sit downs with people I just did one within the last six months\nAnd we found out that this particular gentleman was better off doing a private life insurance policy and taking his a option he provided believe it or not a hundred percent survivorship for his spouse and all tax free using life insurance wow that's a very so that's an interesting option right so\nBoom or a bus was all about the three legged stool Social Security pensions and\nYou know for one case so to kind of wrap up with pensions if you're already retired and have one that's great mhm\nUh but I understand that just because you have a pension doesn't mean that ten years from now that that checks going to be their exact okay depending on where it is and how well funded that organization is\nThat check maybe cut back or stopped mhm so just keep it in the back of your mind but if you have one believe me you're one of the fortunate few\nIf you have a pension and you're not retired you need to understand your options fully and then I understand that sometimes you may have a lump sum option would that pension\nAnd can you create your own pension through your what is called the private annuity where you buying it on your own versus using the company now the benefits of that might be if you buy it on your own you're taking the money away from the company that could fail right\nAnd you're putting it probably somewhere else okay with a much you know potentially larger and safer place\nAgain the financials or the insurance company drive that\nBut you know this way here you're taking it in total control right so you have to make these options obviously before you retire give us a call or the first time caller will give them the book and an opportunity to sit down with me uh and discuss the pension options and what the do's and don'ts are\nThat phone number is ... for for for a zero zero three again for the first time caller is you'll receive a copy of steam brand new bunk TIVO retirement and you'll also be able to sit down with the one on one and get those questions answered at the end of the day\nHow do you make sure

find dearly for for for a zero zero three times you really\nFor for for eight zero zero three it is not joining us welcome to the show are talking about a boom or bust how pensions Social Security and for all and K makeup that three legged stool to help you get you to and through retirement and see do you want to recap the pension discussion we just had [noise]\nYeah well basically we talked about pensions and the fact that most of us don't have them anymore and for those of us who do just because we have it doesn't mean it's going to be there ten years from now or some of these pensions mismanaged a Massachusetts ranks thirty six in the country\nOn how well funded a pension Zach so we just wanted to make sure that people were aware of that if you are not retired yet and you have a pension you really need to understand what your options are and you need to do that obviously pride he retire\nAnd we can we can sit down and chat about that and I called the ABCs of pensions it's in the book\nUm that we put out there and we'll keep talking about how you can get a copy of that but\nDo you have your retirement talks about the ABCs of pensions and how to choose the right pension option based on your situation whether you're married single I'm and I'm you know it's just a it's a quick read and we could do a consultation about what the options are so that's the quick rap\nAnd are going to jump into the second leg of the ... which is Social Security right just\nTry and Social Security is kind of on the table for all of us at least we help I mean outside of pensions being an empty promise there also is talks that may be Social Security won't be around and I think they said twenty thirty four twenty thirty five but yeah fingers crossed that you're going to be there for all of us and if it is the good news is it's all part of that three legged stool and Steve\nThis is so important that when you think about your Social Security and deciding when to take it right\nYeah it's a it's a really huge decision you know I've been hearing that I've been in the business for Thirty years and you know just say no just in the eighties they were talking about the same thing oh Social Security and so [noise]\nI don't think it's ever going to be doomed because it is a staple of the retirement system for Americans period and a discussion you know more people rely on Social Security than any other form of guaranteed income so understand\nThat we're talking about guaranteed income now when I talk about possibilities are opportunities we're talking about money that that is paid out to us for our lifetime just like a pension so there's guaranteed income\nSocial Security will be there I think will they change it yeah well they tax more of it probably will they raise the age of ... of a normal retirement probably because we are living longer\nThe reason why it's a problem is because of our Social Security is in trouble a because the government has quote unquote borrowed from it to fix other plants and with no intention of paying back obviously\nUm and people are living longer and are draining the system so that that's the biggest challenge having said that I Believe it's going to be there it's a staple it we need to make the right decision the last thing you want to do is to make that hundred thousand dollar mistake which we call it\nI have a software program that goes through one to claim how to claim one is the best time now nothing's perfect in this world a lot of it has to do with life expectancy in your health\nBut really the decision of Social Security if you're married you have to understand it's not just about you right it's a marital decision because Social Security is a pension that\nUpon the death of one spouse you lose a check and you lose fortunately use the lower other to check you keep the higher one so the key is to make the highest check as high as you possibly can because that is a check that's going to be permanent\nZero zero three are on line and renting separate higher radio dot\nZoning [noise] biggest thing I thought if you look at your money in terms of a child\nWhat it can do to\nWhat are you are still actively working recently retired details you breathe\nClearly designed retirement strategies that will help you protect your will provide income for life and leave a legacy for your family whether it's a hundred million I don't care I'm going to treat you the same way as anybody else because I Know it's important to you if you take time to come see me that's how I'm going to go to bat for you\nWould be that ... [noise]\nThank you so much for joining us here today of course gave kinds news radio Ninety five ... and this is ready to retire radio is the main Donny of fairly financial and we appreciate your time with us here today my name is Jeffrey kind of alongside seed each and every week\nVariety on the radio and we're talking about those things that affect you and your financial life as you get closer to retirement or\nMaybe you're all ready there we have so much to talk about on today's show because\nMany times on the show we talk about developing income for retirement you know you walk away from that check you got to work and now you're going to start taking that check that\nYou generated through all those years on the job if you have questions on anything we discuss today please feel free to pick up the phone and give us a call and you can sit down with Steve one on one find\nZero eight for for for eight zero zero three and here's the deal when it comes to collecting that check it might be attention and might be a four O. one K. and might be even Social Security ever going to dive into those topics and much more and talk about\nThe solution is you can find right here at family financial right Steve\nExactly right just some you know I've been doing this for Thirty years so I read and I hear stuff to just like everybody out there about what we need to do a retirement whiz to write the goes how do we get from point a to point the\nAnd it's not like I have all the answers but you know after Thirty years sitting with people going through real life scenarios talking about Social Security talking about pensions\nTalking about for one case for fifty seven for three days rollovers to roll over to leave it there how much income can you take how long is it going to last I have a unique sense of this and feel of this cause a I'm a boomer okay I Am like many of you out there\nI'm One of those folks who don't have a pension so I'm not fortunate enough to have that like most of us now coming into retirement I have to save\nMy money like everyone else alright systematically put it away and and I use a four one K. to only I use pre imposed tax I kinda I like my buckets just you know I like to have money and different sources but ... when you get to that point where you're five years out all your right around the corner\nIt's like okay now what do I do we know right now and you look at the market from a historical standpoint runner all time high or nearing it right with their we'd been there up and down a little bit the last few years but we've been on a three hundred percent tear since the last crash\nWhat do we do we just keep going down this path you know and say hey I've done well before so that's what I should do or is it time to as they say if you're at the casino take some of the winnings off the table and reposition that\nTo somewhere where it's safe and you can still make a good return I'm not saying put it under the mattress some saying look there are ways that you can take the money you've done well with and I've just met with someone last week we had this conversation\nAnd he said you know Steve you're right you know if I can still use a market index to make money but not risk it I'll feel good because the endgame as income right just it's it's ... it's how do I replaced my working income with my savings so I Want to turn my savings into in a check\nSo that I don't have to get up every morning at six or seven o'clock or eight o'clock and make that check I Want my money to be my check and today we're going to talk about how you can do that\nHow you can create layers of income and build that foundation you have using your three legged stool your Social Security your pension if you have it and got to talk with you about that\nAnd the most important piece which hopefully all of us have at this point our retirement savings accounts for one case for three days IRA so and we're going to help you to build that solid a retirement income plan you want and that you need to have for that greater peace of mind that greater security you have going forward\nAnd found out building that foundation really literally from the ground up and with over Thirty years of experience in the business Steve you are the retirement income specialist it's all about making that money and keeping that money right having your cake and eating it too and I want to talk about this article that you did for Forbes boom or bust how to survive and thrive in a modern retirement world\nBy sabotaging your are asked the the\nYou know in the past it it was a little bit easier when we all had pensions and today I mean it just so you know out there you know back in Nineteen Ninety forty two percent of workers had a private pension gay\nBy two thousand Thirteen that number was down at Thirteen percent and currently only seven percent of us in the private sector now offer employees pensions that's it mhm okay that's it so when I say that most people who work you know a state job for the government they're the ones with the pensions everybody else doesn't have pensions right so\nThat's the world we live in right now people who are retired there's only about thirty percent of people retired now that have pensions\nAnd so for those people you've got to ask you you're in trouble\nYou might be um just because you have a pension doesn't mean it's going to stay there and be there forever\nExactly ... says when it comes to pensions\nYeah that's a great way of putting empty promises because\nYou know most of these pensions you understand pensions have to be funded so they have to be funded by the employer okay whether it's you know the government funding you know whether it's a big corporation who's funding it right so about Fifteen Years ago Ninety two percent of these pensions were funded fully funded\nToday it's sixty eight percent and oh by the way ... Massachusetts\nOnly sixty two forty three percent of the pensions of funded and we're ranked thirty six in the country while not\nNot too great so what what happened what happened well obviously two thousand they took a took a big effect right um none of these took a big hit and it's tough to recover low interest rates have really rocked\nPensions because most pensions invested in bars you know uh because they want to be somewhat safe with the money because they have a future obligation to fund\nWell if the interest rates are way down in more and more people are retiring and more money's going out the door it creates a problem writing so that's a problem bad management okay\nI'm with low rates of return\nSome of these pension managers of forced to take a little more risk to try to get the return up to try to meet obligations and of course with more risk comes potentially more reward but it also can turn the other way and caused pensions to be underfunded and and possibly go bankrupt and with government pensions [laughter]\nA lot of the problem is that the investment decisions fallen politicians and not financial professionals that's kind of a problem so\nWith that when I talk to my article about boom or bust\nI talked about that stolen I talked about basically how do we solve this problem if you um have a pension right and you're retired mhm it is what it is right you have it you're lucky and hopefully whoever you're with is doing a decent job and you can rely on that check\nBut if you're not quite at retirement yet\nOkay and you have a pension you need to understand that you got to make some choices with that pension and most of it falls on what I refer to as the ABCs okay and what I mean by that is\nOption a as taking the biggest check you can and essentially just inheriting your spouse and children okay now why that may sound like a terrible idea it might be good if you can apply certain things to it so ... is that way be might give\nHalf the check to your spouse and see might give two thirds but as you suspect has a price you pay for that\nIf you go from eight to see you might have to give up eight to ten percent of your check\nTo provide the survivor benefits so well yeah but you know what you're doing just that you're what you're doing is you're buying life insurance\nThat's exactly what you're doing you're paying a premium to provide a survivor interest ... so the question becomes a you're better off doing it through your company or\nAre you better off doing it privately and I've done many many meetings with this sit downs with people I just did one within the last six months\nAnd we found out that this particular gentleman was better off doing a private life insurance policy and taking his a option he provided believe it or not a hundred percent survivorship for his spouse\nAnd all tax free using life insurance wow that's a very so that's an interesting option right so\nBoom or a bus was all about the three legged stool Social Security pensions and\nYou know for one case so to kind of wrap up with pensions if you're already retired and have one that's great mhm uh but I understand that just because you have a pension doesn't mean that ten years from now\nThat that checks going to be there exactly okay depending on where it is and how well funded that organization is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "20"}
