T. H. E. X. and as you say we're a high yield\nBond fund and um I imagine you offer um other services as well like through ... separate accounts and things like that or do do only the phone from you know only only the fund we want to keep it all a\nGreat tidy ... that makes it easy for us [laughter] uh so in any case\nI'm a high yield bond so we're going to talk about that a ... to that\nAs we get into our conversation but maybe before we do um [noise]\nMore started more generally and talk a little bit about the environment in which we find ourselves you know the setting for fixed income we just had the fed chair and out so recently the change in interest rates on the short end uh for the the overnight rate ah\nYou know ... what where do you see us in the scheme of things with respect to uh interest rates where they're headed where we are going and um you know uh how far into this process are already are we do you think relative to how how much interest rates may rise\nYeah I'm a up to the fed raised interest rates are this early those um [noise] there's last week excuse me yeah and um and uh we we you know the market is pricing in a few more rate increases but the fed itself as what they call the dots\nThe er and by that they uh they put out a chart of a weird they think interest rates are going\nAt each of the fed governors and members of the open mark ...\nMarket committee and um and what's interesting is that the uh the fed is price is is to is predicting a more rate increases than is the is the markets so you know well we take away from that is um that the markets are meeting again the fixed income markets are pretty aggressive\n[noise] do you think that ah the fed has to\nHave a rosier outlook in the way they put those plot\nA projections I'm I'm On there a forecast yeah\nThat's a that's a good that's a great question 'cause they 'cause they have all they missed meaning the fed the fed is ... in that direction um\nI think it's it's pretty I I think they missed in the past because of things like oil prices going down and inflation under shooting again maybe not necessarily through you know through no fault of their own and you know so fast forward to today I think it's what they think will happen\nWith the ... calvary out that if uh\nAnd if you let's say you had a trade war ... shock some shock from out of out of the blue then then clearly they would they would move off of what they're predicting but under under sort of normal base case outcomes I think that they are they're signaling that what\nThey want to do [noise] you know if any thoughts on that\n... they well I Would just say that for years that in you adjust is that they've been off and the market's been under shooting them and it's playing out again if you look at the top lot here they they're expecting to be more aggressive but the rates in the market is um and I tend to agree with the market uh\nThen the fed just because there's a history there and I think it behooves the fed to be more optimistic\nIf they signal to the market that they expect the economy not to be as good in the future it could be a self fulfilling prophecy and I think that's primarily their motivation of sorry\nGo ahead no no I and I understand that indeed there was a definitely a school of thought back a bunch of years ago you know half decade ago and it was exactly that it was the signaling and then the whole the or the way they went with quantitative easing was in fact you know oh if we cut rates that's going to signal something so that you know that's a colorful argument I understand that\nHow much do you think we have to worry about the idea that\nI mean this is potentially been a concern in the past where the fed has a been a more aggressive on say in this case raising rates are to the point that it could undermine the strength of the economy and slow down the economy is that something\nThat's a concern or how how likely is that as a possibility and how how far off would that be before that becomes a problem do you think\nYeah so you know one one of the mysteries out there right now is the is the ... what we call the shape of the curve\nAnd a half the other how one year five years ten year thirty year bond ... ... what the deals are on those variance on those instruments and the uh all the a little bit surprising thing is that long term interest rates are surprisingly low for what they would be historically at this point\nAnd um the ... the way you know back to you know as that relates to your question um\nYou know it almost as though is as though the market just thinking the fed is going to make a mistake and raise rates to aggressively because because the long term interest rates are not\nA as high as worthy as they would be normally given what's baked in now I I personally don't think I ... a little bit of an unorthodox view but I don't think that they're gonna um that raising interest rates is going to have such an effect on on them on the economy that it's going to slow it down to that point\nThere won't be the feds fault when when you go into a recession\nI don't think you know they've been raising rates and it it really hasn't uh you know cutting out a sale has so I'm not I'm not a question that\nAt some point could that change though I mean isn't that you know this is at the early stages or even at this such a low interest rate to\nYou know if I'm paying nothing you know a versus one percent or maybe that's not sufficiently motivating to to slow things down but if a you know get to a certain point and might start to have some impact where I think twice about\nBuying that home or you know the car that I Need to finance or as a business maybe a you know making that investment that might might be looking to do with the use of uh in in a resource at a certain point and certainly\nI tend to think that maybe the impact the the ethic as the uh the impact of monetary policy is is not\nNot quite as great as as as we make it out to be on on the economy um and if it is it probably comes through the currency channel by what you mean you know raising interest rates raised raises the dollar and a and so on her next we have sort of export issues on that front\n[noise] um one of the things that um we were talking about before we went on the air was the whole and a notion that\nHave just interest rate risks and I noticed you um you mentioned\nThat there might be some a risk that investors are overlooking a that was written and some notes here or do you think that that's a\nSo I think a lot of times when we talk about this uh between ourselves Brian and myself I'm Still kind of focusing on the notion of a rising interest rates on all worried about how what's that do and I have a certain duration\nAnd he's like I'm not worried about that a bonds to fight over time and we've got a certain approach you talked about a barbell approached last time you were here I think a prize been talking about that barbell approach as a way to to deal with some of these things [noise]\nYou know how much should our listeners the thinking\nI should be averse to the use of bonds generally not necessarily one type or another but just generally it because of interest rate risk\nWell I think I think everybody is probably taking stock of their bond portfolios right now and um [noise] you know it may be I think I think and they and they should because you know rising interest rates mean lower bond prices\nAnd it may be one thing for your your listener or people who own bonds to see their bonds drop in price from\nA hundred and five back down to a hundred because you know to erase some gains yeah but it might be a different thing if if interest rates keep rising and and they start trading discounts and my my focus everyone's attention so I I think that's something that\nYou know people are you know might want to want to pay attention to that you know there really is risk out there with regard to bond pricing I think\nSo in your space I'm ... I'm a high yield bond space or where to bonds you invest in have more a credit risk a they tend not to be as a directly\nAffected by interest rate movements are there are more of a correlated to how stocks move perhaps um\nTo do I as an investor do I get sufficient um risk management by being invested in a high yield bond fund that might not have interest rate risk but ... and I still taking some risk and the process and how do you want to you on TALK a little bit about that notion\nYeah so and then what you're touching on I Believe is that uh in in the high yield bond market there's a bit of a natural hedge by which I mean if interest rates are rising that probably means the economy overall interest rates that probably means the overall economy is doing okay\nAnd so that would mean that the credit risk in the high yield bond market which is you as you say is the\nYeah you know maybe we we look at it is there um I a couple of very hard to measure\nMean probability is very hard to measure outcomes out there they give us a little bit of pause and you know and I mentioned them\nAnd maybe they're each of them as a one in ... chance or you know obviously with varying degrees of impact and and that's just it sits in the back of our mind but you know again each of them is one and twenty but if you add them up you know there's there's some risk there\nOkay so I'm ... I'm as far as the eye can see that you think you know the economic outlook ... generally looks pretty favorable there's no reason to think otherwise this time\nI I well I think so and the Internet you know left to its own devices I Would say uh\nYou know a year if we can recover economic recovery is don't don't necessarily die of old age right you know we have to pay attention I think to the length of the of the of the recovery it's been a long time since you've had a recession\nUm but if there aren't fundamental imbalances and I'm not really sure there are\nUm other other than asset pricing and uh and again maybe in the in the I'm In the in the you know in the in the interest rate markets you know it's it's probably you know I think you want we want to find some ... you know a cause for what would cause an extra session I think we want to see that in the absence of that I Would think we would probably be doing All right\nSo that would bode well for investors to be owning a ... in that scenario on the base or the outlook looks good for these ... you know that kind of risk we\nWould think again our ... our central estimate is that um that the credit risk is not you know in in that case would not be that that grade and you know and so that's good you know that's a good\nThing how do you um well how do you look for opportunity what's what what what's the way a manager at the ... at the you know of a ... you know the specific security well how do you go about finding opportunity to go that's a good one we should get some more of that you know what I mean what what drives those kind of decision\nOh well we're we're funded ... at the end of the day we are I'm somewhat contrary in um value investors in the in the high yield space value investors so the way we look for names as we look at areas and ah that have um\nThat have been maybe beaten up a or Oregon or could be just have a\nDifferent different assumptions and um and again as I mentioned earlier you know the nice thing is where the bonds you look at it and you say oh it's yielding eight percent do we agree or disagree does that seem attractive to us or not and and high yield is a little bit of a\nUm it's not like they're five thousand stocks or if they're five thousand stocks out there a public companies it they're only\nYou know there's there are fewer than\nA thousand high yield issue or so it's a it's a different orbit to focus on I Would say\n... did you want to chime in rather than having\nA well my only comment on that has been um as you spent a lot of time looking at their balance sheets and I'm way you expect it happened in their future cash flows and specifically on their balance sheets you want to look at things like ... capital I'm\nTheir equity balance or if they who's ahead of you in the capital structure how much is at a year in the capital structure um and things like that right\nOh exactly yeah and we do we do detailed I think there are a lot of companies where it makes sense to do a very detailed production models and and uh you\nKnow spend a lot of time on that yeah sometimes you want to look at the marketability or the underlying assets as well I'm just in case they need to fill the assets in order to pay the high yield better um because they're going to get paid for the equity portion is so right\nWhen you say you're contrary somewhat and you know you\nUm does that mean you're buying things when they're particularly poorly rated as an example that you might say this is unfairly a poorly rated or do you even look at what a rating services are a tribute to a rating on abroad and in turn in lieu of doing your own\nAssessment you know but then it may be what is the if you know what is the average credit rating of ... you know your ... portfolio\nWell right now we're getting you know I think we think of ourselves as a single ... um I think because of the a\nConsiderable extent to which we've shorten the ... the average maturity of the portfolio um I think we've we're we've you know the things we've been buying a fairly low risk\nCompared to normal um but you know there are as I say there are times we will we will dip down when when you get paid for a for taking risk you know we would hope that we would do without\nThat will change based on circumstances right yeah okay um do you um you had mentioned earlier when we were talking to figure out whether it was on air a fair we talked a little bit about the anniversary of ... and I think you want it to kind of chat a little bit about this and you know ten years and um\n[noise] oh yeah I mean our yeah ten years almost in the money I ... where we now early October I think the\nUh like just to live maybe two weeks ago or a week or two ago\nI think that there was the uh that it was ten years ago now that the or the Congress voted down the ... the yeah the first time yeah and now it'll extraordinary volatility back then you know really really um [noise]\nI'm In a tough tough tough times um so you know and we were in the you know by being in the credit markets we were in the engine room of Martin the engine room of finance\nAnd uh you know how it was certainly a a very um you know difficult time for the war you know for for the world we we were you know a every step we were you know ...\nYou know we were closer to you know really really disruptive things you know I mean it sounds sounds melodramatic but you know for want of a letter of credit for it sounds like a total plumbing issue you know tankers would not have come into Boston or\nProvidence harbor and dropped off oil at a refineries yeah to turn it into heating oil [laughter] they've very a very difficult period\nYeah it's scary to think about in some respects as I I don't know I've been going through looking at some of the old things I'd read you know talking about at that time just to be more familiar with it as we kinda deal with the anniversary of this in the midst of this period of time was\nVery scary for investors and a sink any lessons that you think we should be driving or can be deriving from that that era as investors\nWell you know I think it ... it it the less a lesson would be that the um you know that the financial system which we um we we we essentially had a Nineteen thirties breakdown of the financial system\nSuperimposed onto the two thousand modern architecture and maybe we thought that that couldn't happen because we we had the banking system sort of figured out based on you know from the great depression but it was it turned out to be more fragile\nAnd you know the thing that you know that I is I think those you know those are the pulse and the guidance of the world that have you know the former um\nTreasure treasury a head of the treasury and head of the time they're trying\nTo impress upon us that uh uh you know sort of in the in a a backlash after the crisis they have taken away taken away that\nThe tools the fed for example does not have the tools to beat the tools that they had to fight the crisis law or the way they did last time and they had let me and I oh I think you know a ... example day on the uh I think was at the fed or maybe it was the uh the implemented I'm not going to the fed backstop the but it was the money market or\nThe money market or industry you know and within a I think about a week after leeman and that sort of guarantee doesn't exist anymore the lender of last resort function is I Believe some somewhat a constrained\nOr certainly tarp which is that with the ... where the you know the infamous quote unquote bailouts\nBut they're they are now is all but prohibited\nAnd that was one of the key tools to straightening out [noise] so um you know guiding her again he's he he was um at the time he was New York fed chair but he became secretary of treasury and in in his book on the crisis he said I thought we would you know when I knew the tools are being taken away from us and we thought we'd put them back in\nBut they haven't put those tools back in\nAnd so we have to you know we have to pay attention will correct me if I'm wrong\nBut I think they would still have the tools to say the id\nThey have a ... a ... that code that code goes back to the Nineteen thirties posts depression [noise]\nUm I think they can arrange a a a range and help finance the sale if it's a systematic risk ... okay I'm going to yeah I'm I'm not sure whether made you know the the exact facility to be there to to um to provide the financing and the guarantees I think those guys\nHave been on a road show to impress upon the country that we need a fiscal response and next recession because monetary tools have been tapped out so I think their fear is\nWe have a downturn and we can't lower interest rates five hundred basis points because we're only yet to present two hundred quarter three percent I'm so there's been pressing on the people that when you want to talk about\nThat for a minute that that whole fiscal responsibility idea I mean you think about the reality that we're we've been in a prolonged Bull Run it's been a good time\nCreative people can be right now with home buying and uh we\nAt slate mortgages taken it to the next step where we're doing a workshop for lack of a better word um on October twenty fifth and found must hear oh that's a good idea for like people looking to buy their first home or something or for who would be appropriate for the\nWell it's really um for anybody thinking about what\nWe're kind of position myself to be in a good place in this kind of a real estate

profession so we're gonna\nThat'd be awesome that's good what's that that's really helpful that'll be good yeah my that sounds great\nWell um we had a number of people say I never even heard of these things before I remember when I used to a professional line that we're working with\nI'm Kara Foley angles and Volcker aunt or Kevin clower at a ... and Clarence Thomas I'm really came up with some very unique tips along with some of the programs we have\nAnd we're going to we're going to present this in a workshop on the twenty fifth October and found them and offer to anyone who's thinking about\nBuying their first home second home and investment property [noise] we're going to offer these tips and then we're going to have an open forum just feels that discuss their specific cue and ...

register and how many people can you um you know accommodate\nWell uh we can handle up to fifty and it's going to be entering museums on the green found this or they can register online we happened to events page that they can go to enriched there on your website like\nOn the website sorry yes it's laid mortgage dot com W. W. dot sleigh sleep mortgage dot com and uh they can also call at five a week five for eight or one seven seven and we just want to know how many people are shut oh so you know what to expect\nIt will

that would remain a Grammy dragging on Youth Radio in Ninety five [noise] WICK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report is rocky by Walgreen NBC ten Boston meteorologist or school or with your early warning forecast W ... mostly cloudy today not as cool low temperatures there to the\nFears is the latest from ABC News I'm Brian Clark President Trump suggested a pause and Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court may have been a good thing and the Senate prepares to vote\nIn the last week by God\nYou know the very day but a great Dane you know turn out so it's a great family friendly and as well I mean we have a letter to look\nLike a lot of family you know that's a nice um so you know you're you're a runner with your passion is running right um so you cut ties out into a fundraising has is a fundraising about when you do these types of that's the\nFact gay I'm In very we aren't we are so grateful we had quite a few people this year that turned it into a fundraising in that press um [noise]\nIt's a thirty dollar fee to get in and all of the sons go directly back to our programs um but we have quite a few runners this year that made them on Facebook posts about it and get a fundraiser specifically for here on the transmission\n'em out imagine too it's just great uh visibility like reaching maybe different people different audiences than some of the other events that ... to the you know it seems like kind of reach different crowds in different endeavors does that make sense\nI think so and you know it was really great and this year in particular happens almost every year that someone just happens to be at the beach and they say hey let's hear and then transitional about 'em and then a few more people come over and ask so at the visibility it's it's really\nWindy and there's all the social media that comes out of that and you\nKnow I was saying how you guys on the ground or whatever yeah so you know um\nIt's part of it All right it helps keep the visibility and the top of the top of mind awareness I think\nUm what I got out of Sunday was that there were some eight children and families there and just see the children out there running to the heart yeah because it was it was a beautiful family event that's lovely and it was fun\nSo I'm Cindy you shall we start by just reminding everyone about heroes and transition you know the the origins the or to work you guys to sort of your mission I guess maybe a a good way to put it\nThat it's um it's hard to believe that we are now in our ninth year wow All right well then it will be nine years that we've lost our son and started here is in transition\nUm and we started it because of ... as ... um passions to help the veterans um and once we got started in developed our um key um mission of um we had we started with home modification um service jobs you're\nTold our uh our audience before but a decay somewhat hasn't heard um you know you mentioned Rick I'm because they don't know how tell tell more about\nUm [noise] we lost our son in Afghanistan and um hot in October and two thousand nine\nAnd I'm Eric had a passion he he was one of those um warriors there are military so many of our military people are um this was his life this was his calling he became a marine and a helicopter pilot and that's why do you want to do and I'm ...\nI'm Sorry I did I just wanted to make sure we mentioned aspect of it on\nSo we we continue so we developed here is in transition\nAnd took four main areas that we thought um where local agencies and the CIA I'm needed help 'em and just filling the gaps and from that point we have really developed into different programs we have family programs in the summer with the claim therapy\nUm we have a transitional transitional support groups are are a bunch of all we have a I was just trying to you about the couples are couples I'm gathering\nWill go into that maybe next ...\nOr and then we have a financial assistance um and we um fund other local agencies around so if our veterans need financial help they can come trust directly or go to St Paul\nYou're listening to the WICK Ninety five point one of them and\nWe're talking with a heroes and transition uh the organization or\nIntended a proud about to help support 'em is returning veterans and are these heroes hug may need support in different ways um we talked a little bit about some of the family a sport uh when it comes to a transitional support\nI'm sure there's data and so forth so talk about the kind of challenges that I'm veterans have financially as well as a variety of ways and the ... century or how does that manifest in terms of how you guys has stepped in to help people with\nA transitional support for or how do you hear about it and then as you know you help with ah rent or a mortgage payment or is it um you know how what kind of stuff are we talking about that turns into\nUm [noise] we usually um it's on our contact on our emails and people were reach out to us that way and and request um help\nUm sometimes they will be referred to us by other agencies\nUm and when that happens we have you know we like I said we have buckets of money around that we have given other organizations specifically only for the veterans and if their local we can send them directly there and you know like say fits into Paul they have such a wonderful program\nI'm helping them not only giving them the finances they need but also helping them budget their money and then he has a food pantry\nUm and so they go there if they are not local\nUm and the request is in in this region um we have an emergency we formed emergency committee\nUm we send out a financial farm and the committee will decide you know and all that the veteran and and see their needs um and sometimes we um collaborate with other organizations we have one over in Plymouth called ...\nAnd it's it's um it's a nice organization that helped with finances is not a large organization\nBut we have a clever collaborated with him twice this past spring and we've done to root for two veteran of for two veterans so that's how we get in you know it's going on our website or getting referrals from outside\nCan we talk about your finances as an organization and the sun so he clearly you have to give you your nine years into it it's just blossomed people have responded to I'm In a way that you know they relate and appreciate all that you're doing and watch a sport it\nUm but it seems like you've been adopt a\nUh raising funds to put towards these great you know resorted ways of using them um\nHow does this house plan for your budget I'm sure for some of these different aspects of it I Know you have fundraisers coming up we talked probably about the gala and just a minute but and you have a two of those different locations you know do you still do the New York\nWhere um we are care and transition strictly here and the Cape okay so we do have our big gala is is coming to you know coming up this on November second\nBut having cold bringing Nicole and went to her creative and her ability of right off I'm Nicole came up with the wreck for hit race which is in may which is a grueling race um and that has been a huge huge help for us I mean it's been a tremendous fundraiser\n'em and um it's it's tough work\nAlso shocking get anybody to commit to doing now that sounds awful you know what I mean part part of the effort that it must take for the training but it also I think it's people appreciate the service that\nYou know ... to explain what it is you know so that people understand the fourth haven't heard of it before\nShore so I'm rough for him as a two hundred and twenty miles relay race a throughout Fifteen pounds on Cape Cod and the whole idea behind it um is to\nSomehow you know um allow people to feel just a little bit for just a few hours\nThirty six forty few hours depending on that that sense of I Can't do it anymore but my teams there to pick me up I don't have anything left but I Know somebody you know from afar is watching 'em I perhaps\nConnected to what our soldiers go through after I'm\nApartment it is and you know the first year we did it here on the ... that was um the rain was horrific um and and you know we ... people are like we can't go on and we can't do this and\nThe next you know the next taxes no we're doing this you know so it's it's that connection and you know whether you have twelve teams are twenty teens whether you're renting ten legs are seven like there are five lakes whenever it is\nThat two hundred and twenty miles brings a group together like something that I I Can't even you can't comprehend you're in a van with seven nine people having runners two drivers and\nYou're also beyond what oh soaking wet earth freezing cold or this year um for some reason we hit a heat wave was the strangest things from um east him to um basically P. town area\nAnd it was so hot and you know you watch it it's in may every year the first weekend in may hum and we start in the wee hours of friday morning may\nUm that first that third as may believe that it has this year and then um we finished Saturday afternoon in you know so many people have told us people that have run for us to our veterans on they some some people are still currently you know I'm On duty and then you have civilians and even you know some of our veterans have sent us\nThis is as close as we could get as do feeling like we were still part of the military and that was our goal you know our goal is to just bring that feeling and not only the fundraising but the awareness about what about what here is all about\nYeah there's a connection the it's not easy work so they're going through in the midst of you know some far off land or whatever no and the same time you're a\nJak having sort of physical mental exhaustion but their team camaraderie to help support\nUh it it is and it's been such a well received event that um this year we added a second I'm level to it so you can run as one particular team uh with one then seven runners two drivers or\nOn this year we just want it to be able to um a offered to more people are OK I'm so you'll you'll be able to have to ban a fortune after fourteen runner so on the fundraising is is um\nYou know the runners are carrying how much weight\n[laughter] I'm twenty pounds if you're under a hundred and sixty pounds in weight\nI'm In thirty pounds if you're over a hundred and sixty pounds so I'm you know it's hard for me to get people will say oh I don't know if I can do it and you know I said on this person did it and this person did it and you know anyone can do it if you put your mind to it and you have the you know you had the\nYes people spend in training and preparation\nUm we start you know we we've actually just put out the event um last weekend because of the five K. and uh we we would suggest people start running and getting those things and then we do training strikes twice a week um come January ...\nUh with the tax on you know you don't need a lot of time with the pack on it's more um just to get used to the way it feels and make sure it's not reading and things like that so\nI remember seeing you and your husband at times running down the street with a lot of you know say that [laughter] and they'll call I just\nWanted to say one thing I um I did a triathlon with a team for the leukemia and lymphoma society and I totally like I totally understand what you're saying about being on a team because we train together I mean we had a swim coach every leg and\nUm it just it warms your heart and you you want it to be there for the rest of the people and we encourage each other so I I totally get it it sounds very challenging yeah but when you're on a team that's like you could\nDo anything right and it just it it gives you wings that really does and I just I get I I'm I guess so emotional about it because I can you know not only to even I direct the event but we actually running as well and it's just such a part of us it's such a part of our entire family I mean and that's what you're seeing seeing again\nAnother you know I Know this as a fundraiser for us but again at the team event and you see it you see the um families\nAre bringing their kids around to watch you ever it is that's running and you see the signs and it's just it's an amazing you know it's an amazing weekend\nI think yeah I I'm I'm In the middle of rating I'm a book called sacred spaces which is a spouse returning going on a tour\nAsked to be a goal for us to be on tour\nOr husband who is a military chaplain and that came out very strongly in this part of the book is that you know they're they're um they're such a that team that camaraderie agree that you said that when they're on a deployment and somebody just out there digging or something they just feel like because\nThey're part of that team they even though they have their time off they will take the time to to be with to go out and to be part of the hill so it's all the same but yes military life is has that you\nKnow [noise] so uh to go back to the notion of uh the budgeting of the you know how you guys planned for you know or how to utilize the resources euros\nOr which I'm sure is a big uh ... it's a big difficult endeavor for any non profit to to create their budget and to to have the funds the resources to use you're talking about\nWhen the time comes when you need that extra help turn to Asset Management resources\nHi Chris Boyd here with something more fear financial well being

on the water go down to the beach\nYeah I think we might have I think um I think Sunday tomorrow is going to be the warmer days so um and we were talking about that in the office for like God if we could just have one more each day one more each day Chris\nWouldn't that be great right exactly [laughter] you know I think when\nWe were talking in the first hour we were talking about\nA pound investing we were talking about um high yield bonds not necessarily everyone's cup of tea or how much you want to have you don't want everything necessarily to be an ... uh but I think it was probably a good opportunity to remind people that\nYou know one of the things that people like to get help with once in a while as their their uh their look at their portfolio to look for the rights designs yes I'm\nBryan we didn't get out and get a test to talk about it with Brian while he was here but uh that is one of the things he's he's we spend a lotta time this week on a I don't know if you notice that we were trapped in the office going the PowerPoint pages that he prepared\nIt was yeah I saw the smoke coming out of Iraq that you are a lot of thinking was willing\nTo exactly it was crazy but um you know focusing on where's the economy going yeah big picture first how are things looking economically what do we might think could be in store for the\nUm you know from the point of view of a for the markets how am I we expect things to move and then to extrapolate from that to how does that apply to the portfolios and\nHere we spend a lot of time with a client's we spend a lot of time or at least on our cause portfolios maybe in the background not always with quiet but definitely are having meetings with clients periodically\nAnd then we also have occasions where people will come in and ask us for a to review their existing man portfolio and look for ideas of how we might be of help house we could kind of ...\nJust to propose so I Will just mentioned that uh we like to do that generally in the context of the financial plan to see how it all fits together\nAnd I'm done from ah ah put the portfolio design around that how the cash flows fall into that and how much demand remind out from it risks appetite we out so far so people needing help are happy to be of help in that process\nCan certainly get a scarlet our office at five oh eight seven seven to one eighty nine hundred\nOr you can or cannot cannot sobriety of other ways on our website Pam our financial dot com so closely\nItself class I a a a website I haven't been in the hands and not have the new website

W singer an expert in innovation defense in technology going to snap this book is is really filled\nWith so many examples of how social media has been used in manipulated by various characters everything from ISIS to China to\nYou know those who invented click bait artificial intelligence\nI'm social media has changed politics and the news it's changed our world are any one of these things any more troubling than the others do you think\nI think the challenge of this is\nThat it's a network that links us all\nAnd I'm probably the biggest problem that the one danger that cuts across all these issues whether you're looking at extremism click bait terrorism is is when things go bad it's a combination of arrogance and ignorance arrogance that this\nSanction that things can't go beyond that oh I'm you know if you remember the Facebook ad the more we connect the better it gets well now we know that is what\nThe more we can act it gets better and some parts of it get worse but also ignorance we are all now\nOnline we depend on the space for everything from our social lives are dating lives business\nNews and now war and yet we don't understand the very basic rules of the gang and when I say we I mean everything from or you can see this and the senators hearings was ... to ah over sixty percent of Americans don't understand how social media companies even make money so they don't understand how they're being targeted by this base\nSo the books trying to do is basically give people the tools a tip better navigate this world of likes and why is\nOne of the things that they don't understand because it is so difficult to understand is the dissemination of fake news and it really was fake when it was disseminated but now the phrase fake news has been hijacked as well so how are people supposed to know what they believe on line\nOne of the challenges is um even the term had become contested\nOr even the very nature of a truth itself if you remember the phrase you know no alternative facts well that's not how that works um and this is where you see a layering\nBetween certain things that have played out in politics but also a\nRussian disinformation tactics that literally go back to the Nineteen twenties so you know there's a reason why the Russians are kicking are bought and the space because they've been out it for so much longer and it's again\nIt's part of that notion of catching up but for you and I I'm One of the most simple things to do is basically to diversify your news sources uh goes back to the idea of um the ten blind men\nOr an elephant you know each one touching that elephant only get part of the story and getting part of the story they come away with something that's false this is a law that says a snake\nAs opposed to getting on multiple angles multiple perspectives and what came out this is not just us but it's also for example a teaching our kids how to be better digital citizens because they're equally being targeted in that space\nAnd that's one of the things that social media did it really drew like minded people together\nInto into groups and people have talked a lot about tribalism that's going on in politics today but really it was happening on line long before the contentiousness that we've seen in Washington I mean people will read what they want to read on line and even though they're told not to and that they should read other sources\nIt doesn't seem to be getting through to anybody\nAnd this is the the good and the bad side of this and that you know one of the fun stories in the book because of the very first social network all the way back when the Internet was\nA originally created by the military to link scientist together and they're supposed to be doing scientific research the very first social use of it bringing like minded people together as they started talking to each other not just about science but science fiction\nAnd you know that's the great thing of social media moving forward as we can find other like minded people we can find people who share our interests we can exchange information with them but the danger of that is that you know first it can create these little closed off community sometimes\nAnd second that can be exploited and\nThat same thing has been used in everything from terrorism extremism too I'm kind of the poisonous aspects that if I played out in our politics today a different way to think about this is a parallel to the game of poker or if you sit down at a poker table this isn't you know from the movie around her and you don't know who the market is\nYour the mark and that's what it is for many of us in social media we don't understand that where the mark\nWhen it comes to everything from marketing campaigns but also political campaigns and we need to catch up our understanding catch up our knowledge of the rules of the game so we're no longer being taken advantage of\nWe have a thing in the in the newsroom is that everybody has their their ... and when they see that the president of the United states has treated for the first time in the morning they'll say he's on Twitter\nAnd then that person has to stand up and and read the tweet is just just President Trump understand this really really well or is he just doing it and is he making it the divisions even wider\nThe opening of the book is Trump's very first tweet and\nHe joined social media back in two thousand and nine and when not with politics and mine is funny to go back in time he actually joins as a way to market an upcoming\nTV appearance that he's going to read the top ten list on the Letterman show and the purpose of going on the Letterman show is to try and plug the declining ratings of uh The Apprentice\nPurchases going down and ratings and they're trying to figure out anything and everything to save the ratings and they turned to Twitter\nAnd um and this actually like back to your prior question what happens is that slowly but surely he like the rest of us the columns addicted which is another reason why you can't say you know maybe it would just shouldn't use the space will people become addicted to it it's it's

the pillars of running a business have to meet your bottom line but can you hit the bottom line and make having a social impact\nOne of your top priorities there was in ... and founder of ... strategy sat down with ABC's Rebecca Jarvis on her podcast no limits to discuss how you can be business savvy and have a social impact at the same time why it's so important to do it for those who\nAre thinking about starting businesses are have started businesses and then also those inside of companies where they wished their companies would take on more of an active role in trying to make the world a better place so let's start there okay if you're inside of a company right now and you feel like\nWe're not doing enough look around yeah what can you do well first of all you have a boy and you have colleagues that I'm generally you either work with or you know and you have friends so numbers thank you personally can get involved and and volunteer um\nThere are ... there was actually one point four million nonprofits give or take in this country today do a deep dive into yourself to find out what you care about I'm oftentimes people are led into causes because of personal situations for instance if you've lost someone to cancer\nOr heart disease you might find yourself gravitating towards those types of organizations\nOr you know you might have had experience seeing hunger firsthand therefore you might go that way so I think it's really important to find out what you care about I grew up with a a mother who worked for public television and always told me that it wasn't about making money and it was about doing good\nAnd a father who taught at one of his college for thirty nine years which which taught me you know that a woman's voice needed to be heard you know they had they were second generation um and\nIt is very much about getting back to the community so that was instilled in me from a very young age I always wear my heart on my sleeve and in hindsight probably what really pushed me over the edge as I moved to New York city in two thousand three and I didn't know anyone\nI had a paycheck since I was Fifteen um and\nDid that make you nervous the idea of not having a paycheck and\nOh my God is that I um I left bench and with the assurance of two organizations that said if you leave we will hire you so I left on a friday and I started on a Monday I named it next year since strategies\nBecause I thought it was just a place holder I'm Nick here's the strategies as my ex husband's name and he's a wonderful fellow but it just you know it didn't make sense but again I thought it was just oh until they figure out the next day\nAnd then we're coming up on five years on next month\nCongratulations thank you what do you wish you knew then that you now have come to realize now\nWe'd be here in five years and I would have more confidence that well yes and I I I wouldn't be so terrified and and\nBut the best advice I did receive which I think is the reason for the success was a well two things one and this is this the price of the consulting world when you have good month you have a tendency to want to record\nAnd and and just kind of save it for a rainy day and what you should be doing is using that to invest in bringing the best people around you\nWho do all the things that you are not good at so hiring more hiring more aligning yourself with you know maybe finding partners um but I have been very conscientious about surrounding myself with the people that do the amazing things that I Am unable to do and I also say you know I was the grand old age of forty eight when I started the business\nAnd I don't think it would have been as successful if I had started at age thirty eight and that is because of the pure network effect\nI always say is you get older it's just it's like the law of gravity you just know more people yes um and I've always all my life he can every single meeting and you know it wasn't until Adam Grant came

listening for ABC News Sherry ... [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou got to get it right so one of the big tidbits I talk about is\nThe eight percent boost gay aprons or how many people in the audience right now pretty excited if you can get eight percent return guaranteed on your four one K. and your money just would you be happy about\nThat hey I'm excited I'm raising my hand\nOkay well did you know that still under current law which is always subject to change and I think it will in the future\nIf you are at full retirement age All right you can get\nAn extra eight percent on your money by waiting a year and you can do that from your full retirement age which is sixty six are sixty seven on somewhere in between depending on a date of birth to a Seventy that's a lot of money just think about that for years was thirty two percent so it was an example\nLet's say your full retirement age and you're eligible for Fifteen hundred a month from Social Security that's a fix check for life and you may go up a little bit cost of living not much\nIf you wait for years okay that check is going to be close to two thousand dollars a month for life\nIt's it's huge it's a big difference now\nYou might say to me well what if I really really really really need the money well that's why we sit down and discuss it what did you had other money set aside\nAnd somebody gave you the advice and said you know what why don't we take the Social Security I'm now and will do for the other money for four years and then use it\nWell that may or may not be a good deal why because first of all are they going to guarantee eight percent on your money probably not I mean that's a it's a big number\nSo think about that maybe you're better off using your I raise for one case first for four years and then getting a bigger guaranteed check in writing for the remainder not only of your life but of your spouse's if it's a bigger of the two checks okay it's a\nIt's huge it literally it could mean the difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars if you make a mistake and choose the wrong auction wow that's how big it is that's a big deal yet\nIt's huge and so when I sit with my customers they'll look if you're already retired obviously you've made the decision and that's fine and parts two and three of this will cover that but\nIf you're there if you're contemplating it if you're just ready to retire to get like three or four or five years now is the time to plan to get the numbers to kind of give you an idea of what you can count on and rely on not gas on\nGay for one case in IRAs our guest is unless they're structured properly they're guesses Social Security is not a guess Kay when you get it you get it and you get it for life\nSo it's it's one of the most important decisions that you have to make when your retiree and it's so important right now that I Want to just\nYou know put something out there to my audience I mean this is like you know we're getting a mid August here we're getting right

your life savings in the last twenty or Thirty years but of course that's where you come in and stay tuned them and I tell you how\nYou can get a copy of Steve's brand new book tee up your retirement\nThey don't want to continue our conversation here about the three ways you can benefit from working one extra year\nYou know a lot of us say you get close to the finish line and we say we just can't we're done where exhausted but I think what you hear the benefits here you might change your mind 'cause it's a huge impact and\nWe just talked about how Social Security can impact your retirement and of course when you claim and how you claim so let's talk about here about adding to your current savings and that has to do with like your four one K. and your IRA right\nSure and um yeah so what happens now is if you're over fifty K. which I'm sure most of my listeners are\nYou can contribute twenty four thousand five hundred a year to a four one K. off for three D. plan I mean that's that's pretty huge right so it's it's a Eighteen thousand five hundred plus a catch a provision of six okay and not only that if you're eligible depending on your income you can also contribute another sixty five hundred to an IRA or rut\nSo think about what I just said they were talking about over thirty thousand dollars that you can add\n'em for a year or two or three and I we we talked about what does one year difference make wow what if you if you're sixty sixty two you're still contemplating retirement\nAnd you put in not just one year or two years or three years four years right more if you're sixty six and you you out just the four years and you bump up your Social Security by thirty two percent\nIn your work those extra couple of years and you you max out K instead of putting in I don't know five percent or six percent of whatever the matches you do decide to max it out and and um save that additional moneys\nThose monies now maybe they're not going to have a huge impact on your net income okay for when you retire but think about twenty four grand a year for two three four years\nThat's maybe an extra fifty to a hundred thousand dollars that can go a long way towards your travel and fun bucket okay you heard me right when I talk about people when I meet them I talk about buckets of wealth\nAnd you need to have an income bucket is the most important one okay would you agree that\nAbsolutely need income for like you want to replace your working income with non working income and that consists of the Social Security which we talked about pensions if you're fortunate enough to have one in of course those for one case in IRAs so you need an income bucket\nBut then you also need an inflation bucket right just to keep pace with inflation so you can stay retired once you get there or again we're going to talk about maybe working for fun or as a hobby next but you want to be in the driver's seat and have that that a decision to make on your own and so\nJust adding a little more money to your plan can now create that travel and fund bucket imagine having an extra fifty two hundred thousand dollars set aside that you can just earmarked for Italy\nFrance or or wherever you want to go that you wouldn't have had had you not have the discipline just to think about that extra year or two of work or maybe even\nLooking at your own contributions and say boy\nI could say more than six percent I even think about it I'm working I don't think about it I just picked the number and here I Am getting close to retirement I really need to look at this because again this is one of the three legged stool that's important your Social Security being number one\nAnd your four one K. is an Irish being a huge part you are in control of this you can control how much you say when you save and so\nIt's to me when I sit down and meet with people this is paramount to have this discussion how much you putting away but then the next question is can you put a ball can you put more way\nRight and so you got a yeah I guess I can the kids are out maybe maybe college is paid for finally and maybe you now have more disposable income as to what you can do or like to call it discretionary Edward disposable it means like you can throw it away right discretionary income\nYou know here's maybe I'm going to have a chat with Steve because that's really what it is it's just a chat to come in and to and to talk about where you're at what your goals are so\nAgain I'm going to throw it out there for anyone listening tonight as many call

what's going on\nGetting ready for the fall which is an extremely busy time\nFor us it fairly financial it's when we really get into our client appreciation events and our fall lineups of workshops in seminars that we do to help educate folks so going to be pretty excited about the show because after we're done with the San Francisco to talk about we're going to really throw some special office out there to our listeners\nYeah absolutely I again want to remind our listeners you've been doing this for over Thirty years you've recently published your first book called tee up your retirement and Italian just a few minutes how you can get your hands on that as well and if you're wondering okay what is the theme of this overall show again ready set retire radio with Steve and Sony the whole idea\nIs doing to help you make money and keep money right have your cake and eat it too\nA lot of ... will go into retirement feeling overwhelmed and that's understandable because it can be a little complicated but that's exactly what Steve here to do is to take that stress away from you and to give you ideas and strategies that is going to help you be successful in retirement and\nI Want to talk about a couple of things here on today's show maybe let's start with the three ways that you can benefit from working one extra year you get close to the finish line that last lap right around the track and do you think that it's killing me it's going to take everything just across the finish line\nWell what if I told you if you went one more lap how it's going to greatly impact your retirement would you have the energy to do it so let's talk about that let's talk about boosting your Social Security income state\n[noise] yeah well that's one of the ways and um we have a lot of conversations about this because retirement is not what it used to be you know and I wrote about that in Forbes dot com article that you know address or it's not the days where you retire at sixty five you get a pension Medicare health have a nice day\nEverything has changed all the rules have changed it's all about\nReally the bottom line is when can you afford to have the money you've saved worked for you right and so in my book we talk about these three legged stool and one of those are three legs is of course Social Security\nAnd Social Security is the last bastion is that last guaranteed pension really 'cause we're we're we're losing our pensions right we have for one case and things like that and we'll address that next but Social Security is extremely important why because you only get one shot at it\nTo do it right ... it's one of those\nPension auctions where\nThere's literally hundreds of options see a traditional pension usually has three right a option you you know you only be option two thirds to the ... sea is half of his boss right it's pretty straightforward\nBut with Social Security my goodness there's hundreds and hundreds of combination so\nYou got to get it right so one of the big tidbits I talk about is\nThe eight percent boost gay ... how many people in the audience right now pretty excited if you can get eight percent return guaranteed on your four one K. and your money just would you be happy about\nThat hey I'm excited I'm raising my hand\nOkay well did you know that's still under current law which is always subject to change and I think it will in the future\nIf you are at full retirement age All right you can get\nAn extra eight percent on your money by waiting a year and you can do that from your full retirement age which is sixty six are sixty seven on somewhere between depending on a date of birth to a Seventy that's a lot of money just think about that for years this thirty two percent so it was an example\nLet's say your full retirement age and you're eligible for Fifteen hundred a month for Social Security that's a fix check for life in yeah may go up a little bit cost of living not much\nIf you wait for years okay that check is going to be close to two thousand dollars a month for life\nIt's a it's huge it's a big difference now\nYou might say to me well what if I really really really really need the money well that's why we sit down and discuss it but if you had other money set aside\nAnd somebody gave you the advice and said you know what why don't we take the Social Security I'm now and will do for the other money for four years and then use it\nWell that may or may not be a good deal why because first of all are they going to guarantee eight percent on your money probably not I mean that's a it's a big number\nSo think about that maybe you're better off using your I raise them for one case first for four years and then getting a bigger guaranteed check in writing for the remainder not only of your life but of

auction that's how big it is that's a big deal yet\nIt's huge and so when I sit with my customers they'll look if you're already retired obviously you've made the decision and that's fine and parts
