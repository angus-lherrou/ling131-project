{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Yeah how do you do that\nWill do you go you got to make sure there is a salted venting there is a ... or there's a substitute to it it just invented drip edge which you\nKnow I Know I Know what they are I've looked into all most of the stuff yeah and you know you're going to get a year to go pass through the insulation it's probably been crammed in there\nSo you're saying there's no air space between the blow the Jack in the insulation you got it okay to write it's really pass just looking to have a new roof done just your roof ... oh yeah All right so at that point you could literally get you a Christian strapping\nAnd you're like you can put you could put the strapping on the existing boards and you can put new plywood over the existing you know boards into strapping reporting and allowing ... air to flow beneath ...\nRight that's what is the purpose of this that anyway I mean I get a different things from the building inspectors some say is moisture to allow\nWill condensation you different times of the year let's say wintertime sure you have all this hot they're coming from the house and you have cold air outside and what that does that the mixture of the hub there in cold air creates conversation condensation right\nAnd that creates more which is very bad for the health of the house and you just got to make sure that you you keep the temperature basically beneath the boards roof boards as close as you can to outside temperature\nDo we you have ... constantly coming winter time and that basically pushes hot there all the ... allowing the cooler entering the area that you sold their queens ventilation and that is required not only for the health of the house but for the life expectancy of the shingle\nYeah that's my point that's what they're interested in\nThe last day they want to make sure that the houses ventilated properly otherwise there is no ventilation Ford the shingles on the warrant to for the shingles excuse me\nYeah so it's a it's a combination of both moisture and the ah air ventilation or he uh\nHe told them this year he noticed\nOn this this is a Cape on the second floor where it crosses the corner of the room there you know federal mhm that's where it really took a beating and above and below at the older you know three cap shingles mhm you can see the difference just in that one area it's interesting you know\nYeah well at least it makes a huge difference even for the heating costs wintertime having who'd ventilation that improves the you know all the way how was the Braves and the all the money to spend on the heating costs they that that also goes down because of your house is ventilated briefs better not\nAnd um I think he's just a smart thing to do David ... is that he's like\nYou would a cost more if you're going to get good ventilation take\nOver time it will cost less in the beginning maybe we will cost more but over time over two years of like five years ten years you will you'll get every penny back\nOkay Davis at the Cape and is it just those those areas where the um you have that slanted roofing the rooms or is it a\n... now it's kinda hard to tell you almost have to put yourself as a diagnostic sharia alright so it was trying to attack in front of the guy I think they were put on two different times and all I'm like a front and re or if you're not trying to stay but just like right on the spot\nThe absolutely it's directly where you only have the money to buy six is probably in that area and maybe five feet a it's a forty five degrees you know the one and that's where you see the real it's been hammered the exciting first they were probably sell you lost face ... to ...\nSo so uh well educated roofer can can guide you in in how to make all that happened then obviously it needs to be done the same time you re doing your roof\nYeah the last a logical point that's what I'm trying to get this information before he you know there's a lot of them come in and say oh it could get that real done boom boom boom boom without ever looking\nInto it anyway I appreciate your time in the ah information\nOh You're

I Would like to just point out for our listeners\nYou know when ... there's the odds of winning the lottery or\nInfant tests and all the remote right yeah um you know you didn't win there still time to try to plan for your future you know what I mean in the ... for most people the way to build wealth is not a lot it's simple it's not easy and there's always Mohegan Sun the building and it to see now in Boston His options that wasn't where I was [laughter]\nSorry [laughter]\nSo yeah no so ultimately it's the idea of just ... you got to spend less and you're bringing you know and then accumulate wealth over time it's pouring I Know sorry for him so much more fun to talk honoring not as exciting in terms of the numbers for most people but\nUm but you know ... yeah\nTalking in tackling gang Chris I'm just trying to win the hundred and ...\nDolls and the football pool every week [laughter]\nI'm so bad I don't even like wasting my two dollars playing the mega millions and just like I Know I'm not going to when I read that my two\nBucks [laughter] getting caught on very stupidity tax 'cause you know it's just throwing money away but yeah there is some pleasure derive from that Don when you have specially when you have these big\nWhy jak paths you know like I don't know what the heck you know give it a try yeah dreamers dream you never know night I went into the mine afford to throw away on when you do once in a while but you want to just take that chance like just two dollars right I had one I had a ticket and I didn't win\nThe ticket yeah I ... I got the tickets because I had to pick the numbers and then had\nTo get how many cups of coffee is or you can it's a cup of coffee cup of coffee I rather have a cup of coffee you\nKnow and yeah I Do know how\nMuch pleasure I derived from a cup of coffee is what gets me up in the tax financially more than a lottery ticket yeah [laughter]\nSo what does a lot to me well I Do think you know what I mean that I I Love when these things come around it's a lot of fun yeah we do enjoy it and I get a ticket to its you know what the heck are but I Do think you know we are finished planning program it's worth talking to people a little bit about big picture\nUm if you spent a a ten bucks a week on a of investments rather than you are putting it into that a lottery tickets you know what's the what's the outcome once likely a lot more predictable than the other\nMiddle Chris let's say I can only saved ten dollars a week what's effective way to invest my money\nI mean she will fund simple mutual fund keep it easy you know I'm a ... index mutual fund and the U.S and the five hundred are there any minimum for those are some do but not not all you know some uh can you know so you could do a what's that forty dollars a month forty three dollars a month or whatever works out too\nSo if you don't do it the monthly a fifth requires all you got to put a hundred dollars in at the time so you do at quarterly further whatever that amounts to each quarter of just how to sit in the setting aside and uh\nAnd in a bank account or whatever until you yank it out on an automated automatic basis and there's no minimum is on a on an ATF or they you know there's some trading costs sometimes but not all do some ATS are free from trading costs so\nDepending on the platform the mutual fund company you know depending on where you're looking\nBut there's lots of easy ways to do that and it's incremental and ... is it going to mean you know if I only say if I only have ten dollars a week um I got to be rich no no you know granted but it's beginning right I think there's any value and just putting it in a savings account yes um I Do I think we are um\nBecause I think a lot of times people don't have the reserve that savings\nAnd then they end up putting it on a credit card or a home equity line of credit or something like that it costs them money so uh having savings is an essential part of the building process for investment you know so yeah absolutely doesn't pay a whole lot right now in terms of uh the interest\nI'm ready access money you know bank money\nAre we generally don't expect to get much more than the rate of inflation so they were trying to keep pace and then we pay tax on that so we might actually lose a little bit of ground and true liquidity kind of money\nI haven't had a savings account since I was like twenty only had a checking account well that but you're you're if you have reserves\nThat you put it well yeah well then I I when\nI went to school for some of this stuff so I felt like you know this maybe I could open a brokerage account and try to invest some money from a pretty young age so that was always my quote unquote savings account mhm um but I I the interest rate was so well I just\nDidn't see a lot of value in the same as you can so I was just not areas where there's not always\nUm as low as it's been lately you know and the other side of it is um for someone who puts money into an investment that subject to market fluctuations\nOr if they need it you know I we generally think in terms of the you know buckets and so forth thinking about buckets strategies when we talked clients but same applies for your savings\nYou know you really have sort of multiple buckets one that's your cash reserve for the emergency funds for the unexpected\nSome that's like just delayed spending oh I Want to take a vacation oh I Need new tires you know there's things that you kinda know are coming but there is there spending just not today spending ... um so you know emergency fund um delayed spending\nAnd then there's investment for the future right so we need to kind of have multiple buckets of how we kind of plan for savings um whether it's investment for the future her whether it's just um [noise]\nYou know tomorrow spending all I Want to take that vacation I've been talking about or um oh gosh I didn't know the car was going to crop out I\nKnow I needed it did you guys you know that ... did you teach your children have savings accounts at a young age\nI'm ... we well with the baby anytime he got money whether it was birthday or any you know anytime even his graduation\nIt was only fifty fifty split fifty went into his savings account in fifty he got to keep uh the one at a game on PlayStation or X. box or whatever so we would always say to him\nWe ... you have to save half so hopefully that I'm created um you know good habits for him that we didn't just give him all the money and let them spend it but we also didn't take it off and say oh no no that's all going in your savings\nWere similar um and we I didn't do a very good job of teaching my kids like the rules of money and investing really I Do that more now that they're a little bit older I'm Talking to them about you know hey these are good practices and so forth sometimes they're receptive sometimes not so much you know that kind of thing\nAnd I'm to that end who wants to go first to at least you onto a jar you're good at ah maybe given the over here you want me to try to say that to identify what each of the questions is we can go maybe start with question one\nYeah let's start with question one because I think that's the one that I said earlier than ever Seattle media did it in the right question\nGetting the motion Russ anyway and absolutely ... most controversial but getting the most attention I think on the TV um anybody want to take a stab at sort of articulating cost him on\nA soil well it's the nurse question yeah go for for a\nSimply everybody should read it first of all because it's has some specifics and the and the booklet but I'm\nSimply stating the state will determine how many nurses are going to be available to care for certain patients under certain conditions right um but uh if you vote yes on it then you will want the state to mandate within the hospitals how many nurses are responsible for a certain number of patients [laughter]\nUm if you don't know then nothing will change that will be ...\nSame thing I'm as it is today going\nForward so essentially that means deemed by a hospital administrations or um you know whatever they deem is necessary for different wings or whatever you want to call the floors of the mayor [laughter] absolutely um\nSo this uh my impression is uh from what I've been told I have heard from people that this is largely I'm being promoted by one of the uh nurses unions to see this change but it's not universally favored by nurses unions\nUm so that's interesting in itself um I can see why a nurses' union would want to have\nA more nursing jobs regulated or they might get more job security right out sounds\nI can understand why that would be desirable that and they probably would would be overworked as much yeah presuming that they're overworked now because this is why the laws introduced her I guess it's a question of whether it's job security or necessity I don't I'm not clear on that and I can see how that would be\nBetter care logically if there's more nurses per patient also definitely be better cost and the sense that there'd be more cost worst costs that are on a sense of higher is what I'm going to be more cost or the services because I'm Still learning payroll involved\nAnd I it it makes a very specific point that the hospitals can't decrease any other part of their hospital administration\nTo a man way by what's up with the nurses so it's going to Costco up the hospital more and to me that's just going to get passed on to the patient and ... and I'm Sorry I'm opposed to this\nIs to say you know I I think that uh I'd just soon have the the way it's currently handled these away it's handled uh nothing administrative assessment of or how do we get the best care how do we what are we a plan our budget how do we do in a way that we think is going to be the most effective I\nI think even like I don't foresee and consequences and correct me if you guys disagree mhm but house is taken a monitor if your costs on your other parts of your administrator and don't change\nBecause of this law they're basically not they're basically mandating that you have to have certain number of bookkeepers certain number of janitors certain number of everything\nAnd I think at some point that is this really how we want things to do we want state run this kind of regulatory burden and I mean things Eileen liberal and I\nAm against this I think I'll be voting no on it doesn't seem and you know if there's nurses out there and started me on the street and tell me why I'm wrong but it doesn't seem logically later works to at least\nYeah and one of the things that I and make mentioned we were talking about this over at my house you know it's so here's the thing I read through my red book that I received in the mail and the you know the different questions [noise] um so when when you read the book and it says okay so if you've had a surgery rain\nAccording to this metric you get assigned to nurses well for someone who's had pancreatic surgery and my sons had shoulder surgery and he ... I guess what happens if Lisa ... and the hospital and she's having her pancreatic surgery and she's been assigned to nurses that now there's a problem\nBut now the government has put the metrics tend to decide how many nurses Lee ... and there's a problem what is that process going to be if they need to assign to more nurses to me like what is what is that whole is like is it you're going to be running around trying to get a signature for somebody because you're not supposed to\nAllocate more people to someone and then how do you lump surgeries like put my son has had and what I had to say if you've had a hernia and you're having surgery but\nYou're having a six hour pancreatic surgery it's two nurses either way\nSo I Would rather the hospital use their discretion to say you know what we've got a problem in Rome three oh three and we need to put two more nurses first is it being I'm somewhere someone's going to have to sign off because they have made this a law\nI didn't even though like I kind of assumed that uh that made that the the intent of the law at least was that they're trying to get more coverage not less but I think you make a very very interesting point they can they not allocate the resources that they need when they need to do it um it\nOr they just have to over staff nurses and no matter what your your your aqua see in the process and the whole process anyway so right you got some voting now yeah I'm voting now for sure not right\nUm well that'll be interesting to see how that plays out yeah for sure and see what a what I was thinking about that how 'bout question to a question to how to do with the um [noise]\nOh what's the Supreme Court decision the Citizens United yeah yeah ... so\nUh the correct me if I'm wrong the essence of ... of the question too is that we're going to tell the federal government how we should be changing uh creating a commission to have an amendment that a\nFederal amendment that we're going to sort of put a commission together in Massachusetts to say how\nToday there's not a no brainer all they want to do is put together a panel to suggest changes to me it was a no brainer to I think it's foolish thing to do you think it's foolish ... I think Citizens United is foolish well fair enough I don't I don't you think corporations should be a problem by lobbyists\nAnd influence in Washington DC yes really okay well that's one person's opinion what are you [laughter]\nI'm so Chris I wanted you to so basically what you're saying is is that because that was the one that I was a little confused on to um to put a panel together to actually make decisions on how much can be contributed to young companies all from from\n... from from that so basically they didn't want to limit to have if you want to make a contribution you can do it yourself\nBut um that's kind of what happens now All right um no but there's ... you're saying there's also corporations there are corporations that political candidates and a lobbyist but it's done not directly right it's done through different or ... or so there's there's rules about that\nNot many because Citizens United ... Citizens United said that a corporation has is the freedom of individual freedom the freedom of speech in effect my well freedom to ... they had they had the same freedom as an individual on campaign finance is a simple way of thinking it right I think we can all agree on that\nAnd um well I disagree that I don't think Exxon Mobil should have more uh\nInfluenced and um you know people on Cape Cod because they can buy a lobbyist in Washington DC a while\nYou can't I don't think they're having my history but okay I don't think that's how it how it works but in the sense of um I think they have the ah freedom to to promote a point of view ultimately they don't have a vote I vote your vote your vote\n'em so it's a matter of espousing\nOf view and if we tend to say oh that makes sense I agree with that than we vote to me you're trying to limit speech when you try to limit how people can use that\nMoney to me this is the Citizens United is the definition of the swamp in Washington DC I'm as President Trump likes to likes to call it um it's people acting in favor of special interest in corporations rather than the interests of the individuals that they\nDon't like the fact that this is Massachusetts trying to say oh we should have a constitutional amendment I'm you know I think it's kind of odd you know that we're going to hell they want to do with this ah through state to promote a political agenda\nKnow you want to promote a political agenda and promote a constitutional amendment go right ahead I talked to a through my vote and my budget on as a ... on the state level\nWell it's there is no budget the people that are like that that are going to be on the committee or unpaid this there's essentially no to all of his family supposedly representing the people in Massachusetts\n... that's the idea and all they want to do is make this committee make suggestions to the federal government there's almost no downside to it as I said no no but if you're if you're vehemently against Citizens United that I understand why you wouldn't want to or not\nOur stay with us we'll be right back\nDo you have the professional doing your payroll if not you can get our

but yeah I Want to encourage our listeners if they need help to reach out\nI think the important thing to think of is uh the the risk that people are pointing out in the newspapers and the non CNBC these arrests that was known for a while and a Christian I have um made efforts to\nTake into account these risks and to arrest allocations and um to decrease the risk portfolios or where necessary and this is why sometimes on the radio we talk about terrorists and um inflation and interest rates and um and we we hope it's interesting to people out there but I think it's also just a warning\nThat things change in the economy and you need to be aware of them and and um\nPrepare your portfolios accordingly um and I think that we both feel that the economy's stone disposition and we don't expect us to head a new recession\nRide any minute to think um current volatility that we've seen is temporary it's not necessarily that we're headed doomsday downward you know indefinitely that kind of thing I think\nI think this was we were heading in their earnings season and people realized that the market and might have gotten a little at itself a little too optimistic they started to realize that there might be more headwinds going into the future with things like um automobiles and housing 'em\nThey started to reflect the fact that interest rates\nAre are being normalized um it's sometimes I think people actually have to see it happen before they believe it or before they they ran into her ...

we're not the VA was separate from the VA\nBut our programs are geared toward veterans who are in need for a variety of different reasons so our programs aim at those who um needs some at a leg up some empowerment they center around\nHousing we have to housing programs one for literally homeless veterans\n... sixteen units and then another whole housing program which gives those veterans once they move on a vast voucher which is the ability to go into a commercial rent\nFor only one third of what their income might be and it gives them is um [noise] then we go into the next program which gives them the security deposit so it's as a transition from homelessness into their own independent apartment\nAt ... at all and all along with access to the food pantry to counseling\nWe also have holistic therapies for pain management massage reiki\nChiropractic or acupuncture et cetera so it's it's a range of five or six programs all aiming at giving people who have had challenges away to get back to their full potential\n[noise] sounds like a lot to keep up with it is a lot yeah I'm ... and ... just in terms of your um your ... your office or resources small group that's actually doing all and a lot of volunteers in the process\nWe have volunteers in the food pantry who are great they're there among the most efficient of all the people who work with us but other than that we have a staff of five\nThree of whom are part time so it's a small group are coordinated all have board members like Mr blaze down here are our salvation because they're in their two and three times a week there there are varying working or\nYeah yeah very good well thank you for that fell and uh the other board members who are part of that um\nYou know uh when we talk about ah there's all the uh coordinating all this must be a lot to keep track of and kind of men maintain I think last time you talk 'til you gave us a lot of numbers about ah\nAnd some of those details at least you happen to remember when the they were on last pending wants to go back and hear some of those are some of the particular will have to look it up yeah I can look it up and my brothers who are they smoke posters yeah I don't know what maybe not there\nYeah Lincoln Holstein embers we have we have over a thousand active clients that line is not a crowd of yeah yeah\nAnd one of the things you said though is that um your funded by the department of veterans service harassed and um but it sounded like from our conversation before you came on um funding is still an issue for you though that to get out added a little late in his shoe and yeah the\nThe way how can that be if your if your government funded aren't you fully funded now like how ...\nD BS pays for our staffing\nSo it pays we've we've generated statistics that it pays for\nThirty seven percent of our whole operating cost ... each year meaning we need to raise ... sixty seven percent of that of that annual budget it's a little bit over four hundred thousand dollars\nBbs scares us one hundred and Ninety two thousand this year\nSo your overall budget is his four hundred thousand or what you need to raise is four hundred thousand\nIn order to operate that's what our our operating budget is silver four hundred thousand\nOr so that sounds like a daunting task for the board there bill especially treasurer [laughter] absolutely\nOne of the things that we've done recently uh within the last couple of years is we have a reorganize the entire um group\nAnd we are now have a relatively new board of directors\nAnd as part of that would have a recently implemented a strategic plan because we've recognized that we cannot just rely on state funding in order to make this operation work and uh we needed to do a lot more planning\nA we're now we're professional organization I Believe and um [noise] as as you just heard we need to raise more than two thirds of what we need just operate in addition to that we have a capital a program\nWhere we're trying to raise an additional\n... more than half a million dollars for 'em to build a housing going forward for for homeless vets we've got a couple of projects on the table right now we're we're\nUh trying to raise additional funds but uh to step back just a bit\nWe did meet with the secretary of Veterans Affairs I'm not too long ago to discuss the situation that we're in relative to a state funded ... secretary arena in uh in Boston\nAnd we explained to him um what our situation is on the Cape and we brought him some of the facts and figures associated with the numbers of veterans and maybe Gina can fill the gaps here but\nThe number of veterans on the Cape the number of homeless veterans on the Cape versus the number of veterans\nIn the state itself and the um number of homeless veterans in the state in total and we looked at our percentages here on the Cape and the and the population that we serve\nAnd based on the um percentages of veterans on the Cape it's very veteran a\nConcentrated on very much so ... and higher ... so what you mean as if I'm understanding correctly per capita or whatever there is a higher number of veterans than other parts of the state\nOf parts of the state we have a very dense population of veterans on on the Cape okay and we we came up with a very in depth analysis to show that I Believe on the Cape we um have seven percent of the homeless veterans\nWill we if we have Twenty one percent wondering when was the fence or we have six percent of the total veteran population in the state\nThey okay ... okay and but that's interesting that there's that many of the\nOf them around here are ... are homeless you know that there's that ... ... yes yeah population and a son that's part of what you're trying to address sure ...\nThe the real key to that is if you have that kind of representation of veterans on the fate yeah what kind of funding to get as a percentage of the total funded for veterans in the state of Massachusetts how does that work out not well you know God well for the K\nOne point eight percent of the total budget for homeless veterans\nSo just to review you're saying we have Twenty one percent of the homeless veterans in the state but we're getting one point six percent of the money spent I'd like for homeless veterans that is correct to say yes correct so that's a mismatch yeah so what do we do about that what's happening on a well what are you\nVery generous and very very generous so um [noise] individual contributions of matching any size are helpful um mhm does or um you guys have a way to maybe and invite those on your website\nIs yes we do that on our website is very simple Cape veterans dot com and there is that donate section as well as several sections which will describe what our services are\nAnd we have a military I salute to the military coming up on December nights I'm at with November ... November I Apologize snow but I ... a night at willow Ben wanes soars and a singer Broadway singer Deborah Toscano\nUh and it's a as a fundraiser was at a dinner or something it's a dinner dinner in a show for it yet or Seventy five dollars a seat and we still have seats open\nAnd another adjust to do just to get more awareness in the community we are we are having a veterans in art program\nA November second at the cultural center of Cape Cod this is appropriate and now the third year where students come in they interview veterans bill was among them the students um interview the veterans than take home what they've learned and they create a piece of artwork\nAnd then we have an art exhibit which will be ethic cultural center and the closing reception for their parents and and the veterans that means a great deal to the veterans someone actually caring about what they went through\nAnd it's I'm a former teacher it's a great learning experience of living history yeah so um that's another one of our just to get awareness\nAnd was that honors or like on a ... like ongoing or is out of ... well\nThe reception where the November second but the um the the exhibit will be ongoing for about three weeks before and after that nice and um one gender is on the subject of generosity we just\nI'm Wendy ... partnership with CG see now known as ... at the golf club\nThey annually for about nine years have run PG see for the troops as one day tournament all the proceeds from which have gone into the T. V. C. fund with the Cape cod foundation so now they've asked us to partner with them kind of take over that\nGolf tournament and\nHave access to that foundation money um through a loan at ... not alone I'm Sorry to grant application that's an extremely helpful\nGesture to us and and we just met with him yesterday and it's\nIt they're pleased to have us we're talking about making it ... maybe more military\nKind of or or with perhaps people in uniform on the T's and and um lack ceremony and maybe military music but uh and they are very very supportive of that so that's a huge just blessing that came to us\nAnd like right yes it is great so on that theme of generosity they're an awful lot of people who just volunteer to help us out or\nLet's take a break because we talked probably for a

is to raise a fair amount of money for your annual budget a suit every year you have this challenge and then uh\nTo complicate matters you're talking about a capital campaign as well\nYeah ... why do so um so now when it comes to your budget you got a a portion of it about a third sounds like you said from from state funding that helps with that and\nUh but then there's the other two thirds that comes from generous donations and a events that helped to raise funds like your golf tournaments and some of the\nPrograms you were just talking about your dinner coming up to suits troops and some additional things to tc tc program and coming up and so forth\nUm so those all can help um is that just\nThat gets you there when you have put all these kind of cobbled together does that get you to where you need or how much more do you find your kind of seeking when it comes to just the annual budget\nWell with this marketing campaign is going to going to be a first we've written grants in the past we've written grants this year\nAnd again I'm ... and we have an interview before the Kelly foundation next week okay we are so those kind of ... these it specifically for programs are lifted

they go to the providers massage acupuncture chiropractic we reimburse the providers because it's um it's the alternative therapies are being recognized as much more\nAs as efficient as far as I'm pain management so so we have grants like that hopefully we'll get that Kelly foundation that Kelly foundation is given to us in the past\nUh we also have two sources of money that we would we wish to recognize it anymore and it's not by name because these are incredible people but one is a group of veterans in their seventies\nFrom the sixties their high school friends from the sixties\nThey want no part of any recognition they almost get angry when we talk about it but [laughter] they give us an emergency fund they they were familiar with that through another program because one of them is a property owner\nAnd he became a landlord to many of our clients so he came in one day and said we just want to do something to help veterans and they\nThe lovely part of it was that he said that when

actually\nComing up coming to an any like on any costume parties are and I'm now we usually just we live in a\nPretty tight kind of neighborhood is a lot of side streets and stuff and so usually what we do is we just go out and walk around and while the kids are traitor training there and you have a feeling it's finally something all the moms and dads and\nUsually my girlfriend pilot does like a bonfire and her front yard fun it's we're living in a wider streets are real tight so it's just fun\nI don't know whether it's supposed to be on Wednesday hopefully it'll be better hopefully\nEvery day I Am you dressing up\n[laughter] trick or treating well it scares the kids when they ring the dye actually really dislike dressing up it's I've never been good at it some people have a severe severely good talent that at the end of my friends do but\nI always joke that you have you ever see the mighty ducks yeah\nI was joking with my wife that I should just bought a Charlie Conway Jersey like\nThe ears and warn that every year and just been that guy\nSo one day I came home and guess what she she had had arrived from Amazon Charlie Conway oh that's a riot there already this year we run out five K. we're going to do it on Saturday it's like a Halloween fun run society um so I'll be where I'm like you see a guy dressed as Charlie Conway running through the Boston Common that you were funny the other\nDay though Brian you were telling how like like where you used to [laughter] right where you used to live like no trick or treaters right [laughter]\nSo when I Lived in Charlestown and um everybody went up to the the bunker hill monument and all the kids and parents basically like set up took a spot around the monument and all the kids have like a safe place to trick or treat around the square block which must have been great if you were a kid you could hit like\nGod Knows how many households by it but in one city block\nUm but if if you didn't have kids or you didn't live on by next to the monument you basically got no trick or treaters so I wasn't worried about it right um then I moved to seven hell and uh I I don't know what it is but kids must it must be the place for kids to go trick or treating\n'em up and down the law you had to live I live near yeah and I was unprepared for this my first year living there\nI guess that's the number ... ... I was living I was a single guy living there alone at the time and all my bus or just didn't stop us and uh I did when I was totally unprepared to back his eyes and I got the back door and with a local bar I didn't know what else to do that's pretty funny um but for now on ever since I've been ...\nIt was a parrot yes right so a ... being the guy who like reached the door and like scares the crowd you know like you know like on\nNo [laughter] no\nWhat do you think I Am I correct [laughter] you know\nA pretty\nFunny I actually I'm I'm like scrambling for we're going to a party so I think I got to have a costume party so what are you going to be I don't know what you know and a couple of hours or so\nA couple of hours yup yup tonight so hardest tonight yeah Saturday Night so\nHopefully they'll they'll have the game on too so we owe nights I haven't taken but maybe maybe just throwing a Red Sox are ...\nWhat was it was a Christian you guys are going to cost them yeah yeah you got to be\nThe millionaire and when you hear that\nVariety as I Am I wrong von ... are now\nAh like these attempted attacks or like the micro caravan or the president saying there's going to be a big task I Know people want to talk about health care\nAnd you see it in the vast majority of the lion's share of advertising in both sides taking taking this on you see it in Republican scrambling to explain why they were against Obamacare for as long now saying they want to protect resisting conditions you see in the president now frankly uh miss dating misconstrue in the Republican position on this to make it sound\nA lot closer to where the Democrats have been for a long time and you could go one eighty around the politics of a bottle of Obamacare Democrats were running scared from this law for most of this decade now they're running probably behind it the fact that they have a chance to to make big gains it's going to be in large part because of Obamacare\nWhen we look at them some of the production side on five thirty eight they're saying that there is that the chances are five and six that the Democrats take the house and five and six at the G O P hold on to the Senate you agree with that\nNo reason to doubt their math and certainly matches the perceptions that we've gotten from the ground and the real fact that it is that there are two different countries voting they just have to be voting on the same day\nUh and and they're voting for the house in the Senate and in in the battlegrounds are different literally different states different districts will determine different outcomes a lot of complicated cross currents that that are all crashing together it's really not about one wave but maybe about a series of tornadoes\nThat's that's a great way to put it what\nAbout all these this record number of women who are who are running this year I mean you know a lot of people are saying oh you know there's a there was a good chance they're going to win it's a good chance a lot of them will lose as well well some of them obviously\nWill lose some of the run against each other so they're not all going to win but it's almost certain at this point Sherry that we're going to have record representation in the next Congress or among women both the house and Senate you're also going to happen you know like we go to the the youngest woman ever elected to them under the age of thirty that's never happened before in us history you and I have a record number of algae beat the women\nAre you going to have a record number of of of women who served in combat positions are you going to have a whole range of first surround women as well as diversity and it reflects the change in country and a lot of these women they have their own reasons for running but a lot of them say\nSimilar factors in this moment being one that's just too important for them to stay on the sidelines ABC News political director recline thanks as always thank you very\nDo FBI agents tracked down suspects in cases like we saw this week the devices were taken to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia but what happens when they get there what kinds of things are investigators looking for what role does DNA play and how important their tiny subtle clues but to the untrained eye would mean nothing\nLead them as as a former FBI special agent be now an ABC News contributor and he helps us out with stories like this he joins us now is more on the investigation when you have a series of things like\nThis what are we looking for like what are they going to be investigating when they take things to the to the FBI um lab in Quantico, Virginia\nWell they're going to one figure out the structure of device so they're going to look at every peace between type\nWhat kind of case we believe

that to create shrapnel joke\nLooking looking for all the different items that are on device they're trying to figure out\nIf each piece is properly symbol is\nSome type of job where you would not go off because obviously these devices gone off to try to figure out why they have not gone\nAnd so that that's part of Texas um as far as the device you also have packaging for every one of these devices and you've got\nA lot of the packages from that point you've got a tape fibers trends personal data friends wherever they can come up with that will help them to ... [noise]\nAnd what about what about um another thing we found that when you have when you're looking at these devices themselves even the way that the wires are connected you can tell if the person was left handed or right hand it I think that's fascinating\nAbsolutely fascinating I'm not an object she buys object I worked with a bomb techs\nAnd it always amazes me their ability to figure out little each but only want such as that way they twist the wire the way they applied tape that indicate editor less added it all indicate\nThat certain signatures are friends of the states the bomb maker tends to do things to say once they make a vice the first time they learn from that and then they will typically do the same kind of make it a device but they might improve on\nAn exercise and the next one we saw that with the ... there were about\nSix packages six bombs that were made by the U.S farmer with\nEach the size and his signature became even if it's a different situation here because a lot it all these devices were probably deployed in the mail system around the same time they were probably built altogether\nOne after another after another um which raises the question of whether it was only one bomb maker or there are multiple people that were making if these laws and if they start to see differences in the development of each\nTo me every song is key to the point where you had more than one person who's sitting at a table and they were just like this one after another after another factory it it'd be looking for signs that situation\nI Want to ask you a question about pop culture all of us have watched the you know CSI and quite a go at all all these shows about what it is to be you know and into the gator when it comes to this so we all think we're kind of a miniature ... you know figuring it out FBI agent didn't are do you get guys who are\nWho are actually building these devices maybe they're doing the same thing on the other side\nAnytime you have a case where there's starting to\nSee you you know a lot of research and because there's a lot of information out there especially record so there's enough people to research and or a\nTerrorist organization magazine which\nIs why they're six eight eight maybe ... or little by little\nSteep come as a former FBI agent and our ABC News contributor we appreciate it very much keep up the good work\nOh thank you very much upgraded\nComing up a crisis that the southern border\nTo Mexico to follow the plight of those migrants headed toward the U.S on perspective after this\nI'm Jeff Berman us attorney for the southern district of New York\nOf justice wants you to know\nBeen sexually harassed\nA property manager a loan officer or housing official a maintenance worker or security guard you\nAll aid for for three eight zero six one seven eight or email fair housing at us the O.

for my\nPoint\nAnd she changed the\nFrom ABC News this this perspective\nCloser look at the top stories and the stories you may have missed I'm Sherry ...\nWe'll see what the CEO taking on the biggest name in athletic apparel\nThat first artificial intelligence systems are close to surpassing\nHumans and their ability to do things like translate languages recognize faces and even mimic human speech what the consequences of a high this rapidly transforming technology and what is a a exactly I talked about it with author Jamie ... dives into the development\nOf artificial intelligence in his new book huge or politics living together in a world transformed my tax\nWe're joined by Jamie ... who is an author speaker lawyer former fellow at Harvard's Berkman\nCenter for the Internet and society and you have written a new book about to technology how far we've come how far we may go in the future when it comes to being digitally transformed you some statistics in the book that that are mentioned that\nAre are are startling when you think about where we are and we're we're going when it comes to technology I mean you say that the average smartphone has more processing power than the\nUm than the computer that sent Neil Armstrong to the moon you say that by twenty twenty nine or computers will be sixty four times faster than they are now um Ninety percent of us keep smartphones within three feet of us at all times even when we're asleep what does that mean for our future\nIt's an extraordinary time in human kind in the history of human guide I think it can be as transformational as us\nFor us as the invention of writing or the agricultural revolution official intelligence systems can already be tested almost all of our own games and they can do surprising thing like Reed let so many human speech or tell whether a smart as a fake smile back to the human beings they can just tell the difference between a\nA malignant melanoma an old old and ... and then the best human X but they can protect your lifespan if you have\nCoronary disease or cancer better than the best human doctors and my messages that this is just the gun they take a logical revolution and historical times I've been going for just a couple of seconds and it would be surprising\nA an eye out you implausible to suppose that it's not going to affect politics like like it's affected every other aspect of our lives and the big message of the book Sherry's that\nAs we move into a wild with these extraordinary systems those who control the most powerful systems beat I Tex ... governments with increasing they control the rest of us and that's a political problem that our generation will have to deal with\nAnd one of the things the book first of all is called future politics and it's funny because we are in such a political time right now but I I really liked the way that you\nTalk about politics itself and it's not that Democrat or Republican but this line politics refers to the collective life of human beings including why we live together how we order and bind our collective life and the ways in which we should order and bind that collective life differently\nHow we communicate how we get along how we live together and we're all being um you know we're using technology in such different ways now than we don't even know where we're going now I think that's what's kind of the themes is that we're all sort of\nCaught up in this digital revolution and and and we don't know what it is where we'll go\nYou've hit the nail on the ... I mean often when I say I've written a book about the future politics people's income writing about the mid times over the next presidential election and there's a little bit of stuff in that but we ... minds will be confined politics to the next election cycle that life cycle\nOr the next presidential cycle on looking at the life cycle of human beings and how that's going to be changed by technology\nAnd what kind of role does morality play in all of this because um another thing that you mentioned that that is fascinating is a virtual reality and you know you you can look at a\nYou know are up for this hour and getting in Africa or you can you can look at Niagara Falls you could go there in person but as you point out you could also be in virtual reality\nAnd not the ... you could be someone who kills puppies who determines what morality is when it comes to technology what hurts people and what doesn't who rely we're relying on for that\nIs such an interesting question I mean just last month an optimist came out with a\nThe ... system to promise arena style\nExperiences and I and you can definitely see how someone might use that for instance to imagine you know the de de landings participating in them storming the beaches but what if he wants to be on the other side defending the beaches and as you say what if you wanted to experience being a nine eleven terrorists

CEOs now taking on brand giants like Nike and Adidas I've been following\nYou and I'm Myron you from afar for some time now um I think the first story I read about you with that from the get go you thought I'm taking\nOn Nike and we will buy man I Do I actually look back at my first pitch jak recently in the first page says and build in the next great actor were brand so ambitious and people certainly thought it was foolish early on but here we are we're making it happen where did that ambition come from you grew up in Boulder\nYes grew up in Boulder super outdoors the town I'm I have a mom and her twins so basically two moms that\nKind of have this go get them attitude um and have kind of taught me to always have this kind of on bounded enthusiasm for what you do um and to think really big so we called it reaching for the trees stars um and\nIt's been kind of instilled a nuisance a tiny little girl\nOkay so you're waiting tables is is the idea coming into shape at all at this point for outdoor voices\nNot I had a school no not at all um I found the most valuable thing\nAbout being at Parsons was I took a um a course called designing management so it was actually a business degree but we got proper training and accounting and kind of finances and\nOn the flip side got to learn about the Dolby sweets like adobe illustrator and photo shop which was a really nice combo because once you left school you were able to visualize your ideas like putting pitched ex together et cetera\nBut I don't remember um there have been much like\nJockeying in terms of business ideas in school uh it was really like an environment to to really learn once I left school it was actually a one run on the west side highway that but the idea is ...\nUm because I had grown up wearing lots of Nike love Nike it made me feel like faster you know kind of super humid how much is awesome\nBut when I was in school I think it was my senior year I was running like one point two miles on the west side highway in a very recreational pace and I looked down and I was like it feels like some real dissidents here in terms of kind of the\nOlympic athlete uniform but me going at like a ten minute mile pay so I said I Want to create an outfit for activity that comfortable to sweat and but a little bit more aligned with kind of the aesthetic and like children is a recreation of of the exercise I was doing at that point in my life\nDo you have this skill set from school you have the idea what's your first step\nUm it was all making product I had no idea how to make clothing so um spend a lot of time in midtown and a lotta time on Google figuring out how to makers and um the material that I wanted to use and like\nThere were definitely crop talks that like had one you know only one arm ... that the beginning so\nUm I where are you selling them in your apartment or like how is this happening I had a bunk bed I took the first shelf with the bunk bed out and I kept my rules the fabric underneath 'em and I would do mock up is just so that I Would have something to bring to the pattern makers and be like hey this is kind of the cuts that I Want\n'em but ultimately works with powder makers and in midtown to make the first impulse\nHow did you do that when when you were originally looking for the right partnerships I mean you talk about the mail you talk about the pattern makers those people can make or break ... company how did you find the right people\nI mean uh you meet all of them and and work with all of them um so it was definitely not the first people that that uh we still work with today um but\nYeah I Try to go but you are John blinking yellow people\nEarly on ... and then you start to ask vendors who they work with them\nAnd I'm kind of deduced from there are like once we found the material or the right material source we'd ask them who are the best manufacturers in the world et cetera and so kind of linked together are connected up from vendors a but it's a process\nFor making this has been perspective\nWant to listen to any of our past shows you can subscribe to the prospective podcast give us some of you tell us what you think it really does help\nYou can find it on apple pie task ... wherever you listen to your podcasts\nYou can also find this another ABC News shows the news cast that Tom\nPerspective is produced by Eric ... thanks for listening to the News I'm Sherry ...\nRadio Ninety five WMGK\n\nIn [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWas yes there are ups and downs and ups and downs but you don't have to be a part of that roller coaster anymore I mean it's fine when you're forty and fifty and you're working and you're contributing to a retirement plan but when you're getting to those critical years those five years before retirement those five years right after retirement [noise]\nThose are really critical years in the steps that you take their during those years can have a ... a dramatic effect they could they could really changed the landscape\nOn whether or not you're going to have a successful retirement or whether or not you're going to have to go back to work okay so yes it is important but\nWe have to just stay calm about it and understand ultimately\nThe objective is income it's always has been that's why we say that's why we have IRAs that's why we have for one case and so my question to everyone else there is if you can accomplish your objectives by taking less risk why wouldn't you\nThat completely makes sense and I was just kind of reference something here for a second theme of course the number one fear is outliving our money a hundred percent agree with that and of course when you're on the roller coaster ride of the market you have to be ready for this ups and downs and you happen to your risk tolerance and\nHow much you're willing to lose and at the same time I felt from the states here that say only Eighteen percent of Americans are very confident that we have enough saved for retirement fill all those facts wrapped into one it kinda sounds like we really need some help here\nYeah hit the nail on the head there and and so I had some great questions the small crowd what's what I Love about a small audience is\nThat they're more likely to participate and we got forty or fifty people in the room and I've had that I've had as much as a hundred in the room and well some people may think that that's awesome I don't and so now I specifically carved my audience and the way I Try to get people to my workshops to try to limit to under thirty\nAnd I do that for a reason I Want people to feel comfortable I Want people to feel like they can ask questions okay and and we have a ton of questions I've had the most questions I had at this workshop then probably the last ten that I gave mhm and\nWe talked about that we talked about protecting you know the money and providing an income and how do we do that and you know the same kind of answers came up because a lot of people\nLacked the knowledge because they want on it you know they said Steve among the website and I'm Googling income and I'll Google um um retirement planning our Google annuities are all Google you know whatever okay\nAnd I ended up more confused after I Do the search than what it was before ... and it is difficult out there and that's why I offer these things and I do my radio show so let's keep things simple okay [noise]\nThe goal really ultimately is to provide income and\nA lot of folks are going to say to me well I'd love to do that and I love to have my money I don't want a lot of risk you know and I get that but they just don't know the alternatives and the option so one of the questions I posted the workshop was how many people in this room\nWould take fifty percent of the U.S and the game\nAnd zero percent of any losses and get so many hands went up I'm guessing everybody all of them yeah\nAnd I said do you realize that there are vehicles out there that are available that do exactly that they protect your downside and they allow you to participate in the market now some products\nWork a little differently that some products do even more than fifty percent some do less but the general idea was to protect the money and to participate in the upside as Warren Buffett puts it protect your principal rule number one rule number two C rule number one and so that was the goal\nAnd we just had a little like I said survey everybody raise their hand and I said you know congratulations you just purchased and indexed annuity [laughter] and they went what they said no no we don't like it knew [laughter] yeah\nI knew what he is getting better at and I laughed I said yeah you\nKnow I heard that too I said I've heard that for Thirty years but you know what's funny is people love the results so think of it this way\nWould you rather have your money go on a roller coaster ride while you're trying to take income or would you rather have it go on an escalator and they said well they said what do you mean safe I said well okay\nLet's let's go on the board so picture my audience a roller coaster going up and going down and going up and going down in that kind of you know similar to what the market can do overtime or for days or weeks\nAnd they said yeah yeah that makes sense I said no pitcher an escalator you're in Macy's and and and you're on the first floor and you want to go to the second floor you're going to an escalator and you go up\nBut then you know you want to stay there for a while and that kind of how these products work is\nWhen things are going well you're going up but when they're not going well instead of taking the escalator a roller coaster down\nYou just stay right there on that same for his hold steady you hold steady and then when it comes back up again you get on the next escalating you take the ride up so you never ride down\nAnd when I explained it like that and they kind of drew out that little escalator on the board there were like yeah that's more like where I'm at today and that's really\nI could sit there and talk I was about a new lease but in a nutshell that's what an index into what he does it allows you to participate in the upside and it protects you on the downside and when we get back here in in a minute I'll talk about how you can add even things on there that will guarantee and income for life to [noise]\nUh but what I like to do is to uh put it off are out there to folks who are listening about this I just wrote a new book\nCalled the happy retirement and I've offered this out there for I don't know when we do his last few months we've been doing this great great success a lot of folks calling in\nAnd for the first ten calls I Would love to give them a copy of my new book and then there that talks about everything we talked about protecting assets providing income all these examples that I'm Talking about I Love to give the first time cause of a free copy of my book and the opportunity to\nThat's kind of a an informal chat with me about their situation and what their concerns\nAnd that sounds like a good plan to you and you're all about keeping the money that you've worked so hard to make over the years and you want to sit down with Steve and Sony again a retirement income specialist at first in college are going to get a copy of his brand new book TIVO

guaranteed income for life before we get to that I think it's great that we talk about all these different pieces that come together to make that masterpiece that we call our retirement but here's I get a little concerned as an article that said thirty six percent of Americans aren't saving for retirement at all they've strictly just given up\nWhat's your advice to them and is there a possibility for them that guaranteed income for life\nWas a [laughter] that's a staggering number of people I\nI you know I I Would hope that they would come to their senses frankly and stop putting money away and\nIt's not that hard to do it just requires discipline and if you have a job at a four O. one K. that's your first stop so I I Would totally recommended these folks um get their head out of the sand\nAnd say look you can't just not saving think that something's going to magically happened you're going to be there you know it's not going to happen I mean the the magic already happened the other night South Carolina won the billion dollar so exactly you know that that's not going to happen so\nNo you got to save and yes there are there is time to try to put aside money and guaranteed income for life so\nGetting back to our conversation earlier we talked about if you could accomplish or objective by taking less risk would you and of course the answer is that just about everybody I

ready to get to that and just a second but Steve how are you doing\nI invented caustic it's a great to be in Boston again I mean you get the patriots back on track you get the red Sox in the world series again gray and white film exciting going crazy it's awesome and then the\nYou know my Bruins are getting it together um road trip and Canada but ended up\nWell and are back home so a pretty excited to have them on board and are doing well so yeah and Celtic started up two and a rough beginning but very very hopeful that we're going to get it done this year especially with a rubber on a conference\nYeah yeah exactly exactly they'll have a little bit of a chance which\nIs something we sent them west and a lot of fighting going out there out west [laughter] games everybody yeah on a hill a basketball game breaks out but um you are no great everything's good um had a fantastic\nWorkshop um earlier this week was\nOne of those that I really enjoy because it was a small room both Fifteen folks and I I usually reserve and nice small room at a one of my face down the Cape Alberto ... and it was just great to be interactive my workshops er into actors they're they're never\nSketched there never stage there never um PowerPoints or\nThings like that it's really all about the people who were there\nAnd the questions and concerns that they have and of course I'm you know the volatility the last couple of weeks was certainly on everybody's mind and um you know we had a little bit of a discussion about that\nThat's exactly what I Want to talk about on today's show you know seeing how the markets\nInsanely incredible over the past year writer into the nine year Bull Run everyone's wondering what's happening next especially because\nI've lately you know it's been up and down in the Dallas you know been playing little games with us so you say people are concerned I'm concerned what should we be looking for how do we make sure that our money is protected\nWell I mean the first thing I always try to stress is\nCalmness and to they'll look at your this situation too emotionally because that's when bad decisions can be made um I've always stressed is over the thirty years or so that I've been in business that\nYou need to look at your money in the long term calm fashion and you need to understand\nWhy you save and and why are you on what you are now and if you're not comfortable with what you own\nThen changes should be made and certainly short term indicators like what we're going through can have some effect on that but a lot of it's just as common sense and ultimately what your goals are and so what I've found is\nMost people's goals\nAre fairly similar they want to be happy they want to be able to retire um and have an income for life I mean income seems to be the magic number if it were I turned you can talk about\nPortfolios and you could talk about stocks and you know individual ones and mutual funds and all this stuff\nBut in the end it always comes down to I'm trying to protect ourselves from the number one fear ... that we have out there and that is the fear of out living our money\nIt's a very real fear and with today's you know ... what we are today and a lot we're living longer\nAnd we have less pensions out their Social Security is is there but it's constantly being challenged as to the taxes on it and how long it's going to be there and its current form so there's a lot of stress out there and I get it was a lot of worries out there and\nIf you look at things calmly and you address the goal\nThen there are solutions out there that can help you stay on track and that's what we talked about earlier this week\nWas yes there are ups and downs and ups and downs but you don't have to be a part of that roller coaster anymore I mean it's fine when you're forty and fifty and you're working and you're contributing to a retirement plan but when you're getting to those critical years or five years before retirement those five years right after retirement [noise]\nThose are really critical years in the steps that you take their during those years can have a ... a dramatic effect they can they can really changed the landscape\nWhether or not you're going to have a successful retirement or whether or not you're gonna have to go back to work okay so yes it is important but we have to just stay calm about it and understand ultimately\nThe objective is income it's always has been that's why we say that while we have IRAs that's why we have for one case and so my question to everyone else there is if you can accomplish your objectives by taking less risk why wouldn't you\nThat completely makes sense and I was just kind of reference something here for a second Steve you kind of a lot of course the number one the fear is out living our money a hundred percent agree with that and of course when you're on the roller coaster ride of the market you have to be ready for this ups and downs
