American ancestry you got to be at least one one thirty one thirty seconds but I I don't even think that works a you know you can legally claim it\nBut that doesn't mean you're going to get that to be I a card that doesn't mean you could be in the in the the\nTribal roles you know you're supposed to be on what's called the laws list you don't have an ancestor or the dos list you're out\nIt's it's ... it's a closed club I mean you know I don't I got no problem with that say they they they ... they they they lost their land\nBut I mean that's what makes it even more appalling and upward that she would try to commit this kind of ethics law with no no basis in reality\nYeah it's it's also just so weird that\nShe would continue there and like Blumenthal is a liar but at least one Trump makes a jab at him and kind of died off afterwards because he's not like actually I was there at one point at some point you just have to say you know why\nI lied and own it and then and then and then it then it's dead it's not dead if you if you're like well I technically I didn't lie\nYeah I mean bookers not good Cory bookers and claiming to be Spartacus anymore but she basically went up today and said I'm drawing them all\nBut that's got Jay from Chelsea he's on fire today but it's true\nI Know and when you really think about it\nOkay so she has maybe according to this guy whoever he is some tiny tiny percentage does that mean that she should be checking off because if that's the new standard than kids applying for school everyone to check off that there had panic or that they are black\nAnd you really can't get mad at them because Elizabeth Warren who is probably going to run for president did it oh she's running and the media to plotting her for it like you were so proud of her she is a tiny tiny tiny tiny percent Pocahontas no she's not\nSo I Want to see what I'm looking forward to seeing her FCC report I Want to see where the expenditure is paying for this test how much do you think they paid for the test\nOn health care that they want more than we pay for our test let me put it that well if the guy did it for free than he it's a kind of cause and supposedly he didn't know that he was testing Elizabeth Warren's a ...\nRight right we believe that the ... when\nShe called them up she would do mug and proud of herself so the president always has called my mother a liar but what you're saying is she was telling the truth he's like yes there is absolutely chance that millions of years ago there was someone your family may may happen Native American maybe potentially\nAnd oh by the way the woman the woman that they're linking linking him to is this woman or\nThe OC Sara Smith Crawford now there's no evidence that she ever claimed\nTo be an uh an\nA Native American and and oh by the way she married a guy by the name of a William J Crawford do you know would William J Crawford's a\nJob was it was the Tennessee militia you know what the Tennessee militia was into when the Eighteen thirties we're too We're rounding up Cherokee and hurting them on the trail of tears up Oklahoma\nLast year she was really the child is like a ...\nBut it's worse than that maybe it's like your shoes the child of a slave and a member of the Ku Klux Klan yeah according to her according to her own testimony\nCrazy max and her father's parents must have had such antennas up to know that the person their son was marrying had such distant maybe Native American like what\nDid they maybe just like a point it was like one five hundred twelve yeah so they so boy I mean you talk about the ... you always talk about gay Darby and it was bought gave these people had Indians are yeah they could they could spot it man\nDamage from mile away and I think cell boy and like the big picture thing was even without the Indian pictures still alluded to communist\nYeah being in that it's just fun\nCan't believe she even brought it up so bizarre\nAnd and speaking of on Native American this on

God and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Mark ... a joint Saudi Turkish team as entered the Saudi constantly in ... to search it nearly two weeks after the disappearance of journalists ... last seen going inside earlier today the president spoke to reporters saying he's spoken to the Saudi king\nBut the big story today has that Elizabeth Warren has released what she claims this or DNA tests and she's claiming\nThat it proves that she's a Native American in reality a claim she's it proves that she's not a Native American so the the fake news Boston Globe a you know they're the\nI mean they just have so many fake news stories in the past I Can't\nEven I don't have time to even a lay it all out for you but I'll just lay out of\nMy article Jason Blair Patricia Smith Kevin Call and those are a few of their fake news reporters and column this over the years people that have been busted for uh making stuff up they uh they they made up stories about a ... they said us soldiers were raping women in Iraq during the first Gulf War turned out it was a porn movie\nStill they said Ted Kennedy was turning his life around over and over again that turned out to be a law I mean it just goes it it it never ends so today they put out a story Elizabeth Warren has\nNew evidence proving that she's one between one thirty second and won five hundred and twelfth\nIndie Native American\nAnd that you're you read down into the story\nThey didn't they they they included ... anyone who has it Mexican Mexican DNA Peruvian DNA Colombian DNA so in other words for ... Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name is ... she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan till Warren like the a bust out the Texas Senate candidate whose pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic\nSo my question is if you are one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I well but anyway listen so here it is so so then about like an hour after they post the story they say a correction\nUm the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve that for one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty fourth\nAnd so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at\nMath but I said to myself well if the if the upper range is faults than does at the bottom range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we ... we started referring to what his one sixty fourth and the Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats that put their Facebook paste postings up saying that it's one third that she's she's got evidence\nSuch as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying that at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr Native American or non white and of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she is claiming to be in India and she is claiming that she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University\nLaw school and of course we have ... or ...\nWhat the one fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was before the Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes and here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called omelets with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times French cookbook\nAll right uh [laughter]\n[laughter] you know this is this is just such a such a crock and it's so classic of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media the print fake news\nAnd then correct the fake those after the or\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating the lie which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh initial fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second Indian but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough to claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's not in India\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the end they all left media the headline would say\nWhite woman's DNA past proves she's white woman or a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren fate is a fake ending

story said the the Indian was in the hospital a local hospital in critical condition after he got shot by Elizabeth Warren so these are these are the these [laughter]\nThese are her her ancestor I'm not saying that you you know that uh the shooting was unjustified you almost killed the the the other the kid but\nStill I mean now she's telling us She's a ... she was a victim of this terrible um racism\nIn er in er her parents were a victim of the terrible racism and again we've we've been over this a million times but it's always knew their their new people that are listening and and

Americans that and ah her her uh her paternal ancestors didn't want a their son\nHer father marrying a and indeed\nAnd that that they had to is low to uh to to ah you know to have true love like Romeo and Juliet\nAnd somebody went back in twenty twelve and check out the clip the newspapers the old weekly newspapers in this town where they live\nIn rural Oklahoma and what really happened was that it was everybody was dirt poor gospel you know the the uh the Joe ... the grapes of wrath et cetera everybody was broke\nThey had no money for a a honeymoon or anything like that so they just jumped in

bleep she could probably still you and that other dumpster how he car\nFigure at the the Boston Globe's never going to report what the Cherokee Nation says they're going to they're going to cover this up for me there are they you know they've been covering this stuff up again remember\nBack in two thousand twelve the uh New England historical genealogical society was asked to take a look at her her background and see if they could discover any\nNative Americans in our family tree and this is like the the premier a genie a logical rope and the whole country\nThey they totally drew a blank and they announced that they they didn't try to cover it up or anything like that and uh the Harold my newspaper and uh all the other media outlets ran but the New England a story on genealogical psych couldn't find anything\nAnd the globe just kept running for weeks that the the New England a historical genealogical so I said there was I mean they just made it up\nThey just made it a they don't care\nThat this ... this is how they operate eight four for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number of the highway car show if you if you want to join us now and the weirdest\nThing how we are just just looking at the home page of the Boston Globe and they haven't updated their story to include the statement from\nThe Cherokee Nation funny funny thing\nThere is still reeling from the series of corrections they've had issue on their fuzzy math you know\nAnd again they they just they they they put out the fake statistics but she was really one that she might be one thirty second Andy and then the she was no less than one five hundred and twelve Indian\nAnd that was that was focused but that was bogus first they correct that half of it and then they had to correct the whole thing the whole state but the cheese actually at most one sixty fourth Indian at most these or own\nStatistics or her own DNA quote unquote test for some lab that we don't even know where it is and their fudging the numbers anyway\nSo I mean it's it's totally meaningless and then they come up at the the numbers are meaningless to begin with and they and they ... they fudge him and that don't change it until after I every moon bad in the country has said well she proof she was an Indian\nNo no she didn't prove she was an Indian not at all Ted your next ... go ahead Ted\nYeah somewhat related to the Elizabeth Warren mad at the Harvard\nCase relating to the discrimination against Asians yes ... practice I Associated Press just\nCame out with an article about well more than half an hour ago and the title says Harvard all one race can only help never harm applicants\nChances now that the greatest more of it but I mean correct me if I'm wrong but if you're if you're helping someone\nAnd based on race you have to be hurting somebody else right\nWell if there's if there's to say two thousand slots in each class that's a finite number right Ted so for every person you if every person you accept that's that is at least one person in probably ten at Harvard or by that aren't going to get it right\nThe math as far as I'm concerned yeah no it's it's ridiculous thanks for the call I\nAte for four or five hundred forty to forty two or five voice says can you explain why this doesn't prove she's an Indian how we yeah under tribal laws under the bureau of Indian affairs under the Cherokee nation's own statement this proves she's not an Indian and if you look at the fine print\nOf the DNA report in their own words they use the Peruvian Colombian Mexican DNA so if anything it proves that her ancestor six generations ago was Peruvian Colombian or Mexican\nYeah she she claimed that that that she was a victim or her mother was a victim of discrimination\nAnd that she has a high cheekbones because she was an Indian how could how can you have ... how can you have Indian a physical characteristics which she claimed she did if you're only one one thousand India\nDoes everything she said about her heritage is a lie and that includes the hand and the baby and if you if you if you don't want to accept that then uh you know you're you're in for another a rude surprise at the polls if not in twenty Eighteen certainly have twenty twenty\nRob your next with highway cargo had Rob\nHi uh I I\nThink it's a really only only hurts their claim
