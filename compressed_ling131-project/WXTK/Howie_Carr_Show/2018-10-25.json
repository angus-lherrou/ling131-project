they were still outside really late at night you're kidding they stayed outside yeah I think so I mean it was dark out the videos I thought when it was Don Lemon was taking over from Chris Cuomo I think they're on pretty late\nTaking it to the streets do do do do but how your brother I was born here you had this living\nChris Cuomo gave John Lennon and massive kiss on the cheek and it was so bizarre big lemon took it the wrong way you can do and ... who wants to be and then he went in for like another hug after\nThe kids it was just he was like I Love you brother and give them a real ... and I think even done my mom was like\nWho who was who was in more danger the jaguars Chris Cuomo who got who who was there when the suspicious package that turned out to be a fake all arrive or his brother Andrew Cuomo who heads a flash drive delivered to his office which he said was a\n... you know let us be can be really tricky sometimes they don't fit right sometimes they fell out of the

race really\nActually they both seem to be suffering what I've read about it was caught some symptoms of what they used to call in World War two combat seek medical piece yesterday I guess well\nAndrew Cuomo was on with Chris Cuomo and he was referring to it as the first bombing at George Soros is how\nI Would say to myself you know I'm a journalist [noise] you know I don't have CNN credentials but\nDo you call something that was in a bombing the first bombing like an alien came down on earth and watch that TNN segment they would've assumed that George Soros his house had actually been bombed get it's like if you find a gun and someone's car and then start calling it a shooting right\nA fake gun or a toy gun if you find a toy gun in someone's car\nJay from Chelsea so that wasn't the scoop on CNN there was a shovel yes it was was a couple of shovel ... actually\nIt really is amazing though how they're all I mean\nEvery day cutting up sound for the show um there there are a lot of hypocritical moments from the left but today especially like I I put them on into the ones that stuck out to me the most I mean Hillary Clinton it wasn't like she said the ten years ago\nWeeks ago that was last week was and I think it was more than ... whatever ... looked at the civility yeah well we can ... very recently there was this month to month definitely said we cannot be civil with Republicans until we get what we want\nAnd then this guy this New York times guys down with Chris Matthews and they're talking about how nowadays Trump has made it so you can't disagree with someone without saying they're evil\nIt was only a few months ago not even that they were that Cory Booker was calling judge Kavanaugh evil just because he didn't want him to be the Supreme Court it's like\nThey do they not think we're going to remember and then April Ryan said you know because of President Trump there's collateral damage it was days ago that Nancy Pelosi said that so be it if there's collateral damage for people who disagree with that they are everything they are accusing Donald Trump and the deplorable either way it's\nBeen for two years grace\nI Know what's your name was really a a what's the word\nThis was the chemical\n... or the nadir a distillation\nCombination today was a combination of hypocrisy Ninety\nNine seven eight shows so somebody sent fake or to fake news is that a metaphor or what\nThey said you know\nIf the story the bond if you're gonna run with a bomb story do you mention it then it kind of the big headline that they ended up being harmless ... they seem to be leaving that out a lot I I've only saw that on a few sites most of them concert conservative leaning believe it or not that the bombs were in fact not going to explode\nWait a second race so you but you're not a journalist as you said the journalists on CNN or call like the guy said these serial bomber\nBomber\nHe says yes ... there has been one bomb but it's gone up but he's a serial bomber\nAt some point was when you have this many suspicious packages in the mail and and none of them have gone off since you start to assume that that maybe that was part of the plan\nRight\nHe's not the most sophisticated bomber\nObviously he's less sophisticated than the ... brothers by ... orders of magnitude and tweet on that too speaking of glamorizing um you know the violent rhetoric what about when the Rolling Stone put what's his face haired tall hair like he was a rock star in the covered\nRight we all go to you that it would be a with us on November the towns

this really angers me because\nWe asked them to come on the show by the way he didn't you didn't get back to us I I don't think he wants to play just because he's going to settle for what he said at

that we know him he is genuinely a great person and this is Ron\nRight in the body sockets it's uh I'm hard pressed to think of a greater a moment\nMore historic moment in Boston Red Sox sister right it's probably it's right up I mean it's you know which right up there with a fed Williams yeah the the the the physical ... Ted Williams getting a hold on to this lasted about Nineteen sixty but that was that it really mean to me but he probably after the Boston bombing yeah\nWell but I didn't know I think it was bigger than that I think it was bigger than a\nOn and now moving on to another story that I just I just discuss it how he during their break I think you like to see this girl was in trouble apparently she's an American TV host and she sparked anger when she put up a Twitter picture of herself with a wild goat that she had just hunted down in Scotland\nShe puts it this picture she's\nRelated to Megan Kelly talk about a stupid thing to do\nThe goat is dead is it or now in front of her and she happened\nTo the dentist in Minnesota who shot exactly I have\nNo problem but you're just asking for trouble by putting a pig live with yourself like even the automated like to put pictures on Facebook of them with the whitetail bought that they've just shot it's like okay I mean you're happy you're bragging it's an accomplishment but still if he said what the picture beautiful\nWild go here in Scotland such a fun and they live on the edge of the clips of the island and know how to hide well I don't well enough I\nGuess even where she says I made a perfect two hundred yards shot and dropped him good thing too because he could have ran off the cliff into the laughter that would have killed him why did she exact and it was a legal hunt but people are losing their mind people don't like the day\nThe peta people and the beacon people they've got nothing better to do with their time and to try and ruin your life for posting a picture of a legal hunt\nRight so unless you just want to maybe this is like her way of getting publicity you know every knock a boost but wow is or is she really does a genuinely thrilled to be posting that that did get I'm speaking of Megan Kelly Kelly's lawyer once Ronan Farrow on hand to meet with NBC exact\nThe ones who fired or you mean there what she's talking about yeah I mean\nThere is a certain irony there is is there I called up the NBC executives for being a serial predators and now she's been fired again she did some um but\nWhat is this is just gonna become routine practice you just like I'm going to be my pocket Ronan with me it just to make sure that you got to embarrassed if you don't treat me\nRight now [laughter] yeah it is weird ...\nGood for the guy who got molested allegedly by senator Spartacus that a heated the road and didn't even return is call\nWell he needed his pocket Ronan what had happened but\nA weird thing is a lot of people on Twitter like ... mother conservatives are saying that yes she was stupid to say that but it's not a good enough reason to pull her show off air they just want to pull her short hair 'cause it said exactly when they're winning that's\nGot ... grace let's let's be honest they have sixty nine million reasons one layer pull\nHer hair that it makes sense this is ... they're not getting their money back this is a pretext to get rid of her\nIsn't this isn't there some kind of a ... you know a moral purpose tutored my moral purpose to but it's a it's some kind of failing sinks or there's there was a stupid stupid clause of the contract\nNot defending her at all but it was in\nAnd I and I wrote this today how in your morning minute she didn't say anything like affirmatively I Believe that she was kind of just like throwing ideas out and guaranteed they were stupid you just football and like you know maybe black faces okay she was buying and I'm not saying that it's right but I'm just saying that to act like she didn't come out and say something that was like\nMy God she asked me five right now I don't think I think she just said stupid things that were in her head and I agree with bench appear that this is a way of him getting her off the air or getting a little bit of publicity while they do it virtue signaling and not having to deal with mine Kelly anymore because I don't think they wanted to I thought lawyers are supposed to be smart yeah you would think she would know some\nOf us 'cause that's what she used to be I mean she was a you know she wasn't Clarence Aaron or anybody like that but do you think she would understand how to fulfill a contract cover your ...

about the the Florida governor's race there was a big debate last night as you know between ah the crooked mayor of Tallahassee who's under a an FBI investigation\nAnd or at Enron dissent is the former congressman Newsweek's headline read Rhonda ... campaign said he wanted Florida Hillary Clinton's Florida visit to kiss of death day before bomb threat\nMe kid may ... he he said they what he meant of course was that Hillary Clinton has often been and and like Iraq Obama their visit to a to F a struggling democratic candidate is often the kiss of death right\nSo the publication later had to add an update to the peace clarifying that no connection has been made between the SATs assist kiss of death comment and the bomb so they had to add this is a a as a as a clarification\nOr attraction or a correction whatever you want to call it this story has been updated to clarify that there have been no allegations of any connection between the language used in the email and the series of bomb threats and suspicious packages\n[laughter]\nI Can't even call it a fall a suspicious or even Newsweek has to admit it's a suspicious package\nSo so now the FBI is a is on the case the FBI the joint terrorism task force these are the same people who got a tip from the Russian Secret Service\nThat they there were some uh brothers some Muslims in uh Boston We're planning to a ... planet have a terrorist attack in twenty Thirteen and they didn't bother to follow up\nThe ... brothers before they bombed the Boston Marathon\nThis is the same Federal Bureau of investigation that I received the call from a guy named Gary ... saying that I'm going to kill somebody if you don't come pick me up and nobody bothered to pick him up and he went on to kill three people that we get this is the same FBI they got a call from the end\nOf the Parkland school shooter in Florida earlier this year\nAnd she she laid it out and said this guy's going to shoot up a school and she talked to the FBI ... in Boise idaho I Believe it is for eleven minutes and uh then nobody bothered to call the sheriff of Broward County Florida or anywhere else the talent to give them a heads up on it\nAnd this is also the same FBI who in a two thousand one when the anthrax laced letters killed several Americans the FBI spent hounding an innocent man before settling on a federal researcher who committed suicide in twenty two thousand eight after learning had been charged\nSo you know let's hope\nThat the FBI has more success in this investigation and they had in any of those earlier what's that ah that\nThat I mentioned let's also they don't frame anybody who didn't do it\nLike they did in Boston back in Nineteen sixty five and then when they were finally released after serving thirty five years in prison for murder they didn't commit a than than FBI Director Robert Mueller refused to release exculpatory evidence until a federal judge threatened to find him in contempt of court\nAll

just the wall Street Journal says that wasn't good enough for a Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi who issued a joint statement saying Mr Trump's quote words ring hollow until he would reverse its just statements to condone acts of violence\nWell what are the Democrats going to reverse their statements condoning acts of violence I'm just I'm just bringing it up here too you know if
