actors\nYou know it's not it's you know I can\n... and under any circumstances because I'm just I'm just a rice but graces artist you know she's the best to be in shock your next with highway car go ahead Chuck\nYeah hey I'll tell you a war and I don't know where she's coming from she couldn't even qualify for aid for students as an American Indian because she's not even an eighth hit alone a core like half a Cherokee and she brings a disgrace to the Cherokee Nation\nI Try to know do you know she does she's about a Cherokee though she brings a disgrace for white people you know who she thought that too [laughter] she she's such\nA fraud and and I mean who told her that this was a good idea you know ... you know Elizabeth ... you know once you once you have this past you know from the from you know from some lab that you're not even going to name and it says you could be one one thousand twenty four percent\nPeruvian not even Indian partly via this has got to put a everything to rest senator and and the oddly it didn't work out\nWhat do you think the moment was yesterday when she's slowly realized that this backfired on her but do you think aids had to come in and bring her the news I think\nProbably when they said you know you know Elizabeth a Senator Warren ... you know the globe said it was won\nFive hundred and twelve that it's actually one one thousand and twenty four and then I Wonder if she if she knows enough about math to say well if it's twice as much on the bottom and then it's really not one thirty second it's one sixty four\nSo you think this so all my people who told me this do you think it's really going to impress people but I claimed to be a minority because I was because I claimed to be one sixty fourth Indian and oh by the way it's not really Indian it's Peruvian or Mexican\nBut that not withstanding you get to eat like this from the Associated Press President Trump lashes out at senator ward over DNA test result she released indicating she as Native American heritage and he says her claims are a scam an ally despite\nHer proof for proof\nIn the ... hurting the expert she chose to look into that for her that's when he came up with so what what is the lights ally that well one thousand twenty fourth isn't full blooded Indian I don't understand what the argument is yeah\nThis was hired expert this is like you know Christine Blasey Ford taking her own polygraph and then releasing the result she hired this guy so what's the lie\nRight well she she's talking about the lies about like Donald Trump but she's uh what else is she saying he no he cheats that's another thing he everybody's cheating I mean she's the cheater here right she cheated us she cheated on her way up the uh the academic a totem pole\n[laughter] I mean I think I think the hilarity of your longtime mascot being fully exposed to the world is going to lose your mind she has been completely exposed\nFully understand playing\nOf the evidence here and\nThere are no idea I get it in my column we believe in my column today was a list with worn this bill a fake Indian I understand that I'm just saying I'm just talking about how the mainstream media is trying to\nPortray it you know and by the way here's what we this is the first week in the in the series we all know why real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about the rice I mean I think we would know about these creepy physical threats of you know do\n[laughter] that's one good thing you can always um fact check their crazed claims about about Trump um but the question what do we know about this if it were true [laughter]\nHow about this one how about this when I answered you missed the ... races uh over that kind of me award winning presentation this is the second point bottom line my heritage played no role in my hiring ever the Boston Globe reviewed all the evidence\nWell if that's the case the Chinese auto wing [laughter]\nI'm In their lawsuit against Harvard I'm certainly black students and absolutely Native American should because Harvard isn't doing affirmative action and writes if it didn't play\nYeah you know that's that's the another irony here and again it has it gotten much play that is that she released this this uh fabricated a DNA test on the same day that the trial against her her former employer began in federal court here in Boston you know\nIt's it's rather ironic isn't it I mean she she's ... she's running a scam and at Harvard has been running a scam for all these years I mean hard harbored you know Harvard this a century ago Harvard was discriminating against Jews for the same reason to discriminate against Asians because they were doing too well\nYou know and they didn't want to win and so nothing has really changed their has it\nBut don't weird thing about this is I mean normally the double standards you get on the left it will be um no it's okay for a governor of a state to state and please bring a low level employee to his hotel room dropped his pants and take his it that's not sexual harassment at all and then\nWhen one Brett Kavanaugh was\nDrunken freshman in college he dropped his pants and I have a recovered memory of it Thirty years later so one is is taking 'em no a feminist golf at it from Clinton thing that's that's nothing but recovered memory of cabin are dropping expanses of drunk and ... you know\nThat's a rape that's right that's ... usually there you know they're they're they're ten years separating these things are at least a few years the strange thing about affirmative action flash Pocahontas is\nSimultaneously these organizations like the New York times with Jason Blair um Harvard with Elizabeth Warren\nThey brag and bragging brag about affirmative action we have lots of affirmative action just apply and look at all the diversity and we're going to pick people on the basis of diversity will discriminate against white people don't worry um and then when they won one when we find out that one person in order to take advantage of affirmative action\nUm for Native Americans what are you talking about\nI mean it's it's from one sentence to the next as opposed to two completely\nSeparate separate innocence is here at Harvard bragged about Elizabeth Warren being a Native American diversity diversity\nAnd how much he says is loose number for this never helped me get a job however\nShe was she was an instructor\nAt the University of Texas law school which isn't a bad law school from what I understand but she was an instructor\nAnd ... our word right or University of Pennsylvania\nSo she suddenly decides in the mid eighties to list herself as a minority and appears in this these minority guide books which are basically used this hiring guide to why you know do away with your diversity problem if you're the dean of the law school\nAnd all of us right she's she's working at first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at the at Harvard University law school and she and she wants us to believe that it had and the ... because she's\nBeen cleared by the Boston Globe which right\nIt's just like Jason ... are they at times bragged in Baghdad brags about their affirmative action program to bring in black reporters and then up it turns out Jason Blair is making everything up and what\nYou're talking about well if they're not doing this then they're not doing affirmative action I don't think they they act like they can give preference is on the basis of race\nAnd and no one else is allowed to notice that that's what they're doing as their bragging about\nIt and then she's she's got a different story for she said I I put down but I was a Native American because I wanted to get invited to the lunches of the\nNation from Grover [laughter] that was the\nOne one thousand than twenty and one one thousand twenty fourth I'm\n... and then out shadows recipes and now she\nSays I'm ... I'm I applied because my my elderly matriarch some my family were dying so what does that ... so I decided\nTo become an Indian I decided to become a member of a roof I didn't belong to and thanks for

S. so they passed it not only taken a bribe he's lied about the bribe\nCriminal prosecution was declined the senior FBI official resigned from the FBI during the office of inspector general's investigation\nSo in other words this guy to lied about a crime he had committed and he's allowed to retire with a full pension and they don't even named them in the in the press release\nAs opposed to General Michael Flynn who actually serve the country not just himself\nAnd he did the lie about any crime and the FBI didn't even think you lie to begin with when they first interviewing him\nAnd he and you know he's not going to go to prison they just keep postponing the sentencing but he was convicted of a felony and he's had to worry about this for a year and he's had to sell one of his houses the pay is legal expenses but\nHe works for Donald Trump any crossed Obama's so his life had to be destroyed and this guy's a crooked gee man nothing happens doing\nWell he's going to retire he's going to get his pension and then he'll be a former F senior FBI official and you can consult with companies and make another hundred two hundred grand a year\nRight and and just like we told you last week Lois Lerner the ... the crooked the Internal Revenue service or a high ranking official who who took the Fifth Amendment when she was asked about going after the Tea Party for political reasons to protect the Obama administration in the run up to the ... election\nShe just bought a house on Nantucket Nantucket\nFormer home of John Kerry all we're all the beautiful people live along with Martha's Vineyard it's a a it's a ... it's one of the most up posh resort islands in the United states\nShe spent one point nine million dollars she should be in prison and she she kept her pension and she she now is retired and living on Nantucket isn't that nice\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two in the halls of justice the only justice is in the halls as a as we\nAs we all would say and it's it's certainly true or John your next ... go ahead John\nHey how are you doing good I'm enjoying listening to you talking about in Indian my brother in law is great grandmother was full blooded Cherokee yeah and it comes down to our ... percent\nUh it was allowed to join the trap fairly as I'm going to participate in any of the gambling money they cut it off [laughter]\nAt twenty five percent oh I don't you hate it when that [laughter] yeah a war and we're really in trouble for I left out of shape that hey they won't even give her and they weren't even any of\nHer Powerball ticket or a or a mega met mass mega millions ticket you know for right about your she has got his\nLiterally into my phone number ... from the ...\n\nThis is Robyn from Jonesboro may this is rod in Grand Cayman Cayman Island this is Laura ... says this about how we tie shell [noise]\nPay for for five hundred a forty to forty two\nThat's a toll free number of the highway car show five oh wait says when I go to the doctor's office I bring the heroine [noise] yeah usually I usually go to the barber shop I urge I just go to this so long hair salon which cheaper than the barbershop sixteen bucks\nThat's what I usually take the if I go on Saturday I bring the wall Street Journal the weekend review section and the and the Herald than the post the New York post those are those are the three papers I get aid for four five\nHundred forty to forty two that's the toll free number of the highway car show let's play a couple of more cuts here um\nIf you want to why if you're wondering what the Democrats are planning to do is they reclaimed the U.S house of representatives Jackie Speier from California uh spelled out last night for states\nAt your party leader in the house and the political effect if the Democrats take back the house which is looking more likely according to the momentum currently in all the numbers that are ... are lining up\nShe says that the first thing or a quarter of business would be to make sure you can get a handle on the president's tax returns can't they actually made a priority I think the number one a veil that should be in our dataset contemplated introducing myself is that for every candidate running for the president say\nAnd twenty ... Twenty years of income tax return um that's where we shouldn't be again that's the first\nPriority when they get into in in it to the control of the house by the way I'm not sure they're going to take over the house I mean then again that's just that's that's all left media spent a few weeks ago where they were going to get the Senate and the house now it's now it's down to the house\nAnd uh you know we talked about the civility you know they're sending a that they're sending these letters with white powder in them too was Senator Susan Collins house they're they're chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nA Lindsey Graham would like to talk about the uh the the the resist that and how their civility that they share a when a when they deal with uh when they run into Republicans cuts sex\nJudge Kavanaugh represent the best in our legal community was treated like garbage despicable and I hope they pay a price for that and who spent on health ... seriously yeah spit at me\nNice huh\n... but of course they don't care about that supposedly supposedly spit it a Democrat that would be that you think there'll be a big story a real real big story\nIt for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nSo here David gregory you know he's the a bust out a former anchor of\nUh meet the press fired for crappy ratings his wife is a is a big lawyer a defense lawyer D.C she represented all of a Hillary's age during the espionage investigation two years ago she she got a ball cleared because she's a deep state member\nSo what David gregory now works at the\nThe Clinton news network and uh so listen to who he's comparing the president to win a relation in a really regards to this a murder of the Saudi in a you stumble cut night\nWell he's also a such a loose talk or I mean he just says what pops into his mind not thinking that is the president United States you don't want to play this notion that there were row killers like he's you know O. J. Simpson talking about tracking down the real ... real colors and not murder trial I mean it's\nThat it's just absurd and then later in the day he was much more measured when people talk to him and said no this is where we are and so the problem is that people are listening to the president around the world and I think for a president\nWho has said disingenuous lay in my judgment when he talks about the\nJournalist Amy enemy of the people this is actually a time when an American leader has to stand up and say this is a journalist working for the Washington Post in America with a green\nSo so he's saying that the president is speaking carelessly if he's comparing the president the OJ Simpson when when OJ Simpson said he was looking for the murderers he was the murder so it is he saying that actually\nI've been pretty good people and uh\nSo so with David gregory suggesting that actually the Saudi journalist or worked for the Washington Post was actually murdered by a Donald Trump that he somehow snuck over to stumble and killed him I you know talk about careless a careless a conversation or rhetoric\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two how you want to hear the ah this is a U.S Senate by a out in Arizona comparing Arizona too well Lindsey low head cut eleven\nAnd you can't do it now when Anthony and they're not in a good way and we're not going to get anybody in the low here and you can and payment man [laughter]\n\nHow did she ever get elected to Congress did they not know that that these cuts were out there the Republican ... research seems to be in overdrive this year they're doing a good job\nYou know sometimes ah sometimes one artist seems to have an edge on the other one this year the Republican seems to be big enough more start on the dumps maybe they're just ... start to be a ... since the resistance but yeah for four or five hundred forty to forty two mowing\n[noise] his\nName is Jeff deal and he's running for US Senate\nHis goals the same as yours just beat Elizabeth Warren\nJeffs realty a proven track record of saving hardworking families here in Massachusetts money like defeating the two billion dollar gas tax I meant Jeff deal is the only candidate Democrat or Republican to fight against sanctuary cities and some support to building new law\nAnd proudly stand with our ice ages as they defend the border\nAnd the rule of law Jeff deal is the only candidate endorsed by Massachusetts law enforcement Elizabeth Warren on the other hand\nHolds our law enforcement's racist and seems more concerned with running for president instead of getting anything done for us if we're going to defeat Elizabeth Warren leading the real on Tuesday November ... those are the real the Jeff deal for US Senate\nI'm Jeff deal I'm running for Senate and I approve this message for my deal for US Senate\n[noise]\nHere in Hyannis on and we have three different SUVs you can choose from pilots allowed you as you would be the ivy for right in the middle any HIV is the smaller in the chain the other day I had\nA woman come in looking at a pilot after a test drive she realized it was honestly a little too much part she thought she needed the pilots fit bikes and different options for her lifestyle we sat down again discuss their options and ended up going with the the RV the cargo volume was perfect for ... for kids and all the options she needed and then at the end of the day with the best value\nHigh in a town do west main street Hyannis seven seven eight seven eight Seventy\nTwo sides of the the army is kinda deceptive she didn't want to put a bike rack on the back referring car so after looking at different options we realized she could fit to full side fights for her and her husband in the back of the the RV with the front wheel spill on bring your friends and your family would love to show you the option\nTo medicate God and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\n\nLater maybe the News I'm Michelle fan than President Trump says he's spoken with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and says he denied any knowledge of what happened in the case of missing journalist ...\nBack then didn't even try to prove any ancestry and never really felt the need to do that or apologize for it and ultimately you know again uses a system that she says is rigged against people and she reads it for ourselves so she can get these high paying jobs that are there are a minority hires should have been qualified for it\nWe we uh had the grace a\nPerformance masterpiece theater reading the tweets that she issue to six fifty nine until eight fourteen last night there were twenty six of them altogether so she was in a tweet approximately every three minutes and they were they were a very a very emotional very oh almost to the point of\nThe arrangement and I I think ah I I think this really backfired on her didn't it I mean didn't she think this was going to put the issue to rest then and it and it's a it's started the dumpster fire for her\n[noise] well I mean she's always had the Boston Globe they're trying to provide cover for the you know weight that she got those jobs in the dancers ancestry claims I'm obviously she decided to go out on her own and and put that video out there and again a very quickly we come to find out that I guess most north Americans have I guess more\nNative American potential uh heritage and she says based on on those results which is pretty pretty wild but again or you don't hurt her time in office as a senator for Massachusetts has been marked by doing very little for our state mostly spending time campaigning around the country and I think\nHer attempt to put this information out on Monday was to try to have it for a Washington Post article that come out the day before that was explaining just how extensive she's been working\nTo run for president in twenty twenty I mean she spent\nHalf a million dollars on a donations to campaigns around the country for Democrats you as you know going out there to Ohio gone to other states campaigning for democratic candidates for the last a year plus a she was in Georgia and uh just last week for governors Kennedy and she was in\nPennsylvania and Colorado or strike a Pennsylvania and ah Oklahoma excuse me her home state um\nAbout a week or two before uh when I was up in Lawrence with a gas um mine explosion victims so but she's made it very clear she's running for the White House to twenty twenty and I think this was an attempt to try to uh divert away from the fact that ah that's out there and uh\nYou know I think people in Massachusetts are aware of that they know she has no intention of being a senator that she doesn't want to be our center and uh I'm looking forward to the debate on friday and making sure that we really highlight the what's going on\nHave you taken a DNA test\n[laughter] don't have an alley I uh I don't feel the need to and I mean not that I wouldn't not that it would be proud of of any heritage it determines but I don't feel the need to try to apply for any uh special consideration for anything I own a small business\nKind of fun though you know that's that's the only point I was making no interest in it gives you something to look forward to for a couple of weeks waiting for like Lindsey Graham was saying you know you get you know you're wondering what it's going to be and how it's going to turn out and\nYou know I I think for most people would probably turns out the way they thought it was there was it was going to but that's that's all he so you know what she's gonna do Jeff she's just gonna she she's going to basically ignore you\nI mean she's gonna she's ... she is going to do here at the Donald Trump just like with the tweets last night there was nothing about you and the tweets a it was all about Donald Trump\nThat say what are you what are you going to do what you just talks about Donald Trump\nWell I I'm looking forward to talking about that because first of all everything he promised on the campaign trail he's delivered I mean our economy right now in Massachusetts people haven't noticed is on fire we've got three point five percent unemployment leading the country right now unemployment in the country as a three point eight percent the lowest it's been and fifty years\nWe've got more people working in our state more people making more money to wage increases have gone up about\nThree percent almost and that's given a new tax revenue the beacon hell is almost one point two billion dollars so uh the economy's doing well internationally look at North Korea a year ago they were threatening our allies now they're thinking about doing an Olympics with South Korea I mean that's how\nDifferent are things that are there and I'd say the trade deals have been incredibly effective or the European Union renegotiated there's with us followed quickly by Canada and Mexico and I think China is feeling the pain right now and I think a lick our stock market rallied again today showing that the all the effort to\nUh make trade more equitable uh internationally is working so everything's working in our favor and if if a\nA Senator Warren wants to bring up what's going on with the president I she's bringing up a successful track record in my opinion\nDo you think do you think she used the uh the the so called Native American heritage to uh to get into those those are two and your positions with the ivy league law schools\nWell I Know that she listed yourself in what the national directory of college law school so um and when she lets yourself for that that\nBasically becomes kind of a hiring book for college at University of Pennsylvania in fact they listed her as a white originally and she requested to have a change to Native Americans so um then she got the Harvard job\nAnd after she got the harbor Jeff she asked to beat the listed from that a national directory as Native American so it seems like there was a clear intent on her part to utilize that that claim to benefit herself with her career although she completely denies that and look I I think she's got the answer for that\nBut she uh I think she tried with that video I don't think it worked\nOr stories keep changing you know she said originally she uh you know the list of herself as minority of Harvard because you want it to get invited to lunches and now she talks about her ... her matriarch whenever they are in our family dying and she wants to she wanted to preserve their legacy I don't know how that has\nYou know suddenly changing your ethnic group how does that preserved the legacy of The Elders in your family I mean\nNone of this stuff makes any sense you know and but it's it's it's like sir Walter Scott said you know uh well what a tangled Web we we went first we practice to deceive and now she's now she's hot\nAnd by the way I mean the secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation and said that first of all DNA tests are are frowned upon as they used for determining whether or not you have Native American heritage to begin with a you have to be active in the in the culture you have to um you know I think have some family members that you can identify specifically as Native American um and so if\n... what she's been cleaning for so long is clearly a appropriation cultural appropriation to benefit herself um but\nYou know again Democrats in this country seemed to be able to say whatever they want with no penalty I mean a senator Rosen a a Blumenthal I mean in a down in a matter of Connecticut saying that he was of of Vietnam veteran I I guess there's no repercussions when you lie about your background\nMenendez of New Jersey you know the look of that ad that's running against them about the you know the Obama Justice department said he was a he was a patronizing a underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic\nAnd he says he says no it's not a you know it I mean the the Dems now we're spending three million to what to save his seat where are you getting any money from the from the ... the national a Senate committee Jeff\nWell at this point you know I think they're still taking a wait and see how there were three weeks away but uh yeah I think that um you know I what we've been doing is basically focused on our ground game here in Massachusetts and that's the same ground game that help us win\nIn two thousand fourteen about the question that nobody thought we were going to when we were outspent by millions of dollars the greatness as it seems like Elizabeth Warren is really overlooking his race I mean\nIf you drive around the state and look at the lawn signs you know we pretty much out number her\nQuite a bit and I think that shows that we've been we've been talking to people and she seems to be really more focused on making that presidential run and you know if the other thing too is the comments she's made most recently whether it was a that the criminal justice system is racist from front to back that journey a you know the endorsements of\nA Boston police union that um there's never a roast a Republican for you a U.S Senate before and uh you know it's it's\nAnd then we ... we ran into in a in a ah Winchester the other day\nWe don't know about you compared to solve season much season a black flies season the election season seems to be more caustic\nMessy and even more invasive to your eyes and ears and what we hear it matches brothers may pay some attention to these annoying creatures we don't let them influences one bit believe me
