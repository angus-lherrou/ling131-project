to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's very few labs\nIt has Halloween living scenes and she Halloween which is an abba Hugh haunted house those are some uh lighting and music ... so there are ways\nIs that you can still step up to a game and get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you thanks so much for your call today so it was going on I mean we've got a um a small theater group so what do you put on three employees a year that are in an old movie theatre here in ... and oh how cool is that it's also well I'm told all it\nIs we just sort of a good on the on the motel ... uh uh we get our keys to the church to call the tractors to\nAll these people and we get a law or the people so we got the keys floating\nAll [laughter] that's running all over the county everybody's got a cat [laughter]\nEverybody's got to ... to this place when we were having a hard time controlling it so our idea is to one of the ... you'd like to put like a digital type law\nSure that we can program was coats and give them now is the truth a lot to be able to set the stage to automatically explode or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or whatever is needed for that and the second trick to this\nLittle light or a little guilty to a program like the on site but it was ... off such such nobody will stop it all the time\nRight well we don't live ... you know the good news is is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay awesome and so when you buy the smart lock is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have on a a ... house that I Am\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay and so\nWhen somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say\nThis law is going to work on this I on Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program is right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the ... Gluck if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay and then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like\nIf you want to certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's\nThere so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in is that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie is what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK what more can I add to that right\n\nI live in if you're not getting all three hours became commando show and joined Kim's club that's right head over to get Kim Dotcom\nAnd for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd

you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona some low there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have ah a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check a function not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions and what have you\nAlways yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we were deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd ah you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have a\nThey employ individuals to support the uh the ... function somehow that would work as they would give me thirty quite or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask and then those are the three questions so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost should include she goes oh those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us in our businesses that I Want people to know that\nKnow we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert\nTo a a paying client because they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the site or somebody buildings where you\nAre yes although the we do a ... been billed than we have another company building or another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting as calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under ... Jews as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bugs and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad news out here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all\nMy life parents teachers dentists and always a different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes\nOf course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot so let me introduce you to quit quit is electric it's small light and sleek there's a built in to in a timer that poses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry quip and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals\nQuit starts to just twenty five dollars bats it does it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.

has started marching north again ABC's Matt Gutman is with the group near the that goal Mexico\nThe ... the ratio was basically the lowest ever the market was trading and I speak of the S. and P. five hundred index here was trading basically at seven times earnings and so that was an extremely low level evaluation\nAnd then we have the polar opposite which is the record high level of valuation for the U.S and the five hundred into action that occurred back in the early part of the new millennium in fact it occurred in January two thousand\nIn January two thousand\nThe or to march of two thousand call it the first quarter of year two thousand\nWe saw the price to earnings ratio on the standard and Poor's five hundred index escalate to a record high which was basically thirty times earnings think about this now in December of Nineteen Seventy four at the bottom of the massive bear market that lasted almost two years\nWe had a valuation of seven times earnings on a price to earnings ratio basis\nWell look at that extreme and the first quarter of two thousand when you had that level up to basically thirty times earnings that is more than four times greater\nThan the low evaluation that prevailed\nAt the bottom of the Nineteen Seventy three Nineteen Seventy four fair market so there we have a range including the extremes of the range so we can mark down okay\nWe have a ... year seven and December Seventy four basically that's his lowest it's been historically this is where the S. and P. five hundred index and then well yeah the the hero thirty in the first quarter of the year two thousand\nAnd that's the highest it's been for the U.S and the five hundred index so we could call that the total range including the extreme low in the extreme high\nThen we have a range of normalcy and the rage of normalcy would be in the mid to on occasion the upper teens\nCertainly a range of normalcy would be in the Fifteen to sixteen times earnings range however\nDuring extended bull markets you can see a slightly higher range of normalcy which can reach as high as Seventeen to Eighteen times earnings now\nThis gives you an idea of what to expect most of the time\nMost of the time you're going to have a price earnings ratio is going to be from the mid to the upper teens something in the general area of Fifteen times earnings ranging up to something in the

myself with both like to take Social Security at age sixty two and just to see what your opinion would be taking it then early because most people would like us to work to sixty five or sixty seven\nWell that's your decision but uh as long as you aware are aware of what you're living on the table potentially and a lot of this as a dual life expectancy\nAnd you know if you're a heavy smoker you don't expect to be around long anyway is sixty to his mind but uh keep in mind that you are living on the table if you expect longevity\nYou are living on the table above an eight percent increase annually and your Social Security benefit by delaying each year\nRight when we get to\nI think we'll be at that critical mass by sixty two we're going to have almost a million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved and I do and we are eligible for both patches from the state of Florida\nAnd with our pensions and everything else we're looking at about making about eighty eight thousand dollars a year in income at that time in our life\nNow does that eighty eight thousand include the early taking of Social Security yes\nOkay so is that enough for you to be a to meet your standard of living are to be a net saver or what does what does eighty eight thousand do for you\nWell it's ah almost what we make now okay here early um are at my pension is three will be three thousand a year plus almost a two and a half percent increase for the rest of my life a\nSocial Security be about sixteen hundred and she'll be able to work till she's eight sixty five plus draw Social Security because she doesn't make that much money at the school districts you were working\nYou know here's my answer Bob and and uh I Want you to think about it I Would ... you fill out the blanks but I Would not take the Social Security any earlier than you have to take it and I'm going to tell you why\nBecause every year you're delaying it goes up about eight percent an annual income value therefore I Would take the Social Security only when you need the money\nOkay All right thanks for your ah opinion on that appreciate it\nBob thank you for calling let's get Patricia on the line in a Chicago

attractions one location designed to scare\nIs money to [noise]\nWe are back on Monday talk thank you for joining us and\nCertainly on our broadcast over the years we have discussed some some some critical factors that you can incorporate into your investment management to help you along the way and we've talked in detail about a number of these not the least of which is diversification\nWhere you are diversifying your portfolio money over a many different investments not putting all of your eggs in one basket and we've talked in detail and you know it's something that's come up and that is the issue of how much money you put it in any one stock how many times can you recall\nThat people have called into the broadcast investors have called in and said well you know I have all my money in the stock or most of my money or whatever\nAnd it's just not good investments sense to do that because what you do when you concentrate your investments in one stock did you expose yourself to something that is known as specific company risk\nAnd specific company risk is a big deal if you focus on just one company\nBecause if something goes wrong with the business model or in some other way something goes wrong with your company like Enron for example than the money's gone and that's the reason that we have talked so many years\nAbout our four percent guideline\nAnd our four percent guideline is basically a an offshoot of modern portfolio theory that's all it is and in modern portfolio theory it has been documented\nThat if you own twenty five stocks a lot different than all your money in one or two stocks if you own twenty five stocks with an application of about four percent or a full portfolio as soon as you're doing your own stock picking\nIf you own twenty five stocks across many different industries\nNot twenty five drugs stocks not twenty five tech stocks\nOnly five stocks across many different industries that what you can do in that portfolio is you can um achieve a level of diversification that will avoid this problem of all my wanting in money and wants to walk all my money in one industry group\nAnd that is really a very very strong tenet of investment management that idea of diversification and then there's asset allocation especially someone that's approaching or in their retirement years\nI set on occasion makes so much sense where they're going to adopt a balanced investment portfolio where they're going to have a portion of their portfolio allocated to the stock market\nAnd that includes a portion of that in the international community stock market and then they're going to have a portion of their investment portfolio and the fixed income area\nAnd there are many different ways to invest in fixed income securities and many of those are government guaranteed like FDIC insured CDs or treasury instruments\nSo asset allocation is another of the key tenets of investment management keeping expenses as low as something we've talked about on this broadcast for more than a quarter century because when you keep those expenses low on your portfolio\nThat means that there's more money going into your pocket and less money going into an advisors pocket and that's good because you wind up with more money at the end of the day\nAnd so keeping expenses down is a big deal and you know a good part of that can be done by incorporating something we've talked about and that's including index funds in your portfolio index funds might be the total stock market index there might be the S. and P. five hundred they might be the um\nThat they might be the Russell three thousand but index funds can go a long way to doing two things virtually keeping your expenses down which is great [noise] and secondly guaranteeing you you're not going to under perform you cannot under perform [noise] on\nThe index portion of a portfolio [noise]\nThis is America's money program [noise] where it's all about the money [noise]\n[noise]

investing a major topic for the youngsters\nTeach them the magic of compound rate of return the magic that so many of our money talk listeners have enjoyed\nOver the years compound rate of return has

what happens when they fall and the different maturity is out there ranging from the federal funds rate than overnight rate set by the Federal Reserve all the way up to the thirty year bond and even longer and some bonds\nCertainly gives them an introductory effort on the Federal Reserve because I think that the typical high school graduate\nWe have very little to answer on any questions about the Federal Reserve and some basic information about how monetary policy is conducted would be in valuable\nFor these ah these young students along with that of course would come and understanding of basic economic theory\nThese are all topics that could be included in this to semester mandatory senior year high school course that should be on the books right now everywhere certainly talk about taxes tax rates what it means to you\nCertainly how the progressive tax system works in the income tax all of these topics would be major areas of interest that could be covered in this course obviously\nInflation because it is inflation that degrades you're purchasing power over time must talk about the topic of inflation and all of the others to maybe we can hope that someday\nThe

believe in very very strongly and one of those principles is to make yourself more valuable in the workplace and in some cases that shouldn't a self employed workplace\nTo make yourself more valuable in the workplace so that over time your income can expand\nWe don't believe on depending on somebody else or on depending on some union to protect your income or protect your future we don't believe in that\nAnd we certainly believe in understanding the difference between assets and income that we've talked about on occasion we don't want to wind up like so many of those NFL players we hear about that are in the high incomes and then go bankrupt\nNow we don't want to wind up like that you must turn your income into assets to make a long term difference in your life\nIt's essential investment is\nThe key to financial success over a lifetime so you really do have to take control of your money\nI like to think that it makes sense to take aim at that land a critical mass where you're then

face a some financial\nBecause of our ah inability to to borrow the money necessary to cover a short term debt even if it's not\n... well ah for the next twelve months I can speak clearly I Do not have a concern because I think that uh there are enough people out there willing to\nTrust the full faith and credit and taxing power of the usa to buy our bonds they may demand more interest going forward\nWouldn't be surprised at all going forward if they demand more interest for the debt but I think there are buyers out there for the debt and for the next ... months I've no question\nThat there are buyers for the debt at the prevailing right at that time whatever it might be appreciated called John thank you\n\nJane in Illinois Welcome to talk\nYeah think kill I I Want to get your

ah as you know vanguard has a a a low cost advisory service I knew cost something in the area of\nThirty five basis points which is close to one third of one percent a year look I think if a person is is out at sea without orders and they have no idea what they're doing I think they're way better off\nWith a service like that then making a lot of mistakes\n[noise] I'll uh with the robo it's either you are saying\nWell the one that I described yes I think that if somebody has available to them something like that at a low cost and is going to provide them with some guidance as opposed to being out there and having an absolutely no idea in the world\nWhat they're doing that's a recipe for disaster so I think in a case like that uh it it makes sense to me\nThank you for the call\nMoney talks

question do you need to ask you need to find out whether you're still eligible to contribute to you for all three baby if you do that\nUm as far as I can determine I Am I don't I don't want to stop for all three\nNow so you want to confirm that with your confirmed that with your HR\n[noise] a very important [noise] uh yeah this is very\nVery important that if you make a decision to make a change

become your own personal financial manager gets you out of the way of the shark attacks\nSo you can take charge of your financial future and your family's financial future as well we talk about everything here from investing in your four O. one K. or for oh three baby to saving for all of those important future goals education for the young sprouts\nOur view is that you can get that job done by acquiring the knowledge\nThe knowledge that empowers you to control your financial future and um\nYou can do some really good forward planning and one of the things you might want to do is take advantage of some of those tax privileged accounts that are out there are\nLots of opportunities out there you have the opportunity to put money aside in your um your IRA program whether it be the traditional i._r._a. or the Roth IRA\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars for those under the age of fifty and six thousand five hundred dollars for those age fifty or more even if you have a non working spouse you\nCan open an IRA for the non working spouse as long as it's funded by you're running and has to be covered by earned income earned income so that's another opportunity to put money aside you can make a fully deductibles traditional i._r._a. contribution to qualify\nAnd um\nThat's another way to get money working for the future now that way you get a duck should\nYou get a fully deductible contribution to a tradition liar way is qualified but you can also do a real diary if you prefer if you qualify for that program the amounts are the same fifty five hundred for those under fifty sixty five hundred for fifty plus\nAnd there are income thresholds for Roth IRA eligibility\nAnd these are all terrific ways outstanding ways for you to put money away for the future whether it be in the traditional higher rate the Roth IRA re the most important thing of all is that you take advantage to the max that you can afford\nAnd the other most important thing of all is to absolutely take advantage\nAnd an an a minimal\nTake advantage of the full matching provision if you have a matching provision to so many companies do in a four O. one K. some for three days this is the definition of free money if anybody ever asked you what is there such a thing is free money the hazards yes\nAnd free money is represented by the matching contribution that your company will give you\nIn a four O. one K. or similar type plant because if you meet the minimum standard let's say they say well we'll give you three percent if you put in six will match half of your contribution\nTo six percent so you put insects they add three\nNine goes in nine percent goes in of your salary and yes that three percent the company is throwing in there that is the definition of free money that is like a raise that the company is offering you but you have to be smart enough to take it by\nAt least reaching the minimal contribution standard that you would have to make but that's a great way for you to put money aside as well\nThis is a great time for you to maximize your charitable giving uh my favorite charity as the U.S funds for UNICEF which does great work for children around the world\nI Would also point out that there is a terrific provision in the tax law which is now a permanent law\nThat you can give to your favorite charities directly from your IRA this has to be done directly from your custodian to the charity or or charities of your choice so you don't handle the money you direct your custodian to make the gift or gifts\nNow in the case of an individual you're allowed to give up to one hundred thousand dollars a year\nTo your favorite charities directly from your custodian to the charities from your IRA and if you do that as part of your required minimum distribution you don't have to pay income tax on that money up to a hundred thousand\nAnd some of you I Know one person has an IRA and the spouse has an area where you can both do it\nUp to a hundred thousand each on an annual basis your favorite charities instructor your custodian\nTo make those gifts you may have been planning to make 'em anyway it'll give cash give are indeed money because you're not going to have to pay income tax on this money\nThat had to come out of the IRA anyway as part if you had it as part of a required minimum distribution so there's no reason to pay more than you have to pay\nThis is especially true sense if your ducking charitable contributions you know if you're a high earner that they do take away your deductions as your income increases\nFor\nThose of

remember our explosive\nMoney through our guest interview segments are all there on the archives section [noise] at money talks on demand we get many compliments on money talks on mental people all over the world that subscribe [noise] and so we asked you to check the information out\nAt offering for a time [noise] suffering or hear more become this money to [noise]\n[noise] you\nHave to ... a day every week what a grand in your hand made possible by me of course if you really want to give credit where credit's due if I was living at five after the hour every hour starting at six am one thousand dollars a year old father for giving us nowhere else to go but thank you for that or no\nThank you for dragged out regardless of who was responsible hobby is that when we went in Grand in

God and I hardly radio station use radio Ninety five WICK [noise] [noise]\nThe latest round a bikini island allow pad for Central American migrants you cross introduced into Mexico from Guatemala this weekend are marching north again your ABC's and that got\nThe investment to self insure against the highest available deductible for example on an auto insurance policy very possibly even on a home insurance policy to keep that in mind as a way to a fish and lead manage your insurance future\nSo many other things that are keys we've talked about saving a minimum if you can afford to do so a minimum of ten percent of your income\nBecause that's the money that you're going to invest in your uh higher re or your four one K. or your four oh three baby or ... whatever it may be\nAnd that's the money that over time can compound and grow for you until you reach retirement age level now\nI liked the idea of putting more than ten percent frankly if you can afford to put Fifteen Percent or twenty percent more power to you\nBecause that will obviously accumulate better but at a minimum level if you can afford to do so I Would establish ten percent as the minimum\n[noise] now another topic that we've talked about that so critical is paying those credit cards off on a monthly basis because you accomplished two things\nWhen you pay your credit cards off on a monthly basis number one you don't accumulate some massive usually high interest rate\nDebt that you really don't want as part of your future financial picture you don't do that when you pay them all monthly but the second thing that happens is it works as a discipline on avoiding excessive spending\nBecause if you cannot afford to pay it off on a monthly basis then all you're doing is piling up debt something that I Know many of you may not want to do\nAnother thing that I think is important and you know when you listen to the money talks colors you hear that a lot of people have some work to do on this one and that is when you're approaching or in your retirement years\nYou really want to think about a balanced investment portfolio now balanced investment portfolio at its\nBasic form as a fifty percent allegations of the stock market and the fifty percent allocation to income producing securities and the whole idea about using a balanced portfolio approaching or in your retirement years\nTo manage your risk you don't want to be taking a lot of risk when you're at that point in the investment cycle and the way for you to modify the risk controlled at risk manage it if you will is by adopting a balanced investment portfolio\nThat contains an equal amount or close to an equal amount in stock market investments highly diversified of course\nAnd in income producing security's so that's a thought that I think is that the core of investing which is the adoption of a balanced investment portfolio approach approaching or in your retirement years\nAnd these are are some of the key things that I think that you can do to make a difference\nI'm Bob Brinker this is talk [noise]\nMoney talks [noise]\nSounds sounds no\nMatter how modern your family might be if you're pedaling around that

program money you talk\nI think that\nThose who live in a high tax states are going to have to fess up to reality I'm not saying they're going to like it but I think reality is this is a guy to moment this is a gotcha moment where the federal government has passed a law and they got you\nAnd if you have deductions on state and local taxes of all kinds of nexus of ten thousand dollars they got you\nI don't expect anybody in that position to like it but I Do expect them to do the obvious which is seriously look at relocation it doesn't have to be that way there are places all over the country some of which had no have no state income taxes\nNow what is that going to do that's going to take away from the high earner population because those are the people that would have the um the motives\nTo make a change\nAnd there are still many places around the country where you can make a change\nI mean look at the situation between Oregon and Washington Oregon a high state income tax Washington zero Washington state uh uh there were other states places around the country where the same thing is true\nAnd a look at look at the state like Texas surrounded by states with relatively high state income taxes are states like Oklahoma for example\nWell there you go Texas is not that far from Oklahoma and there are examples like this all over the country look at the difference between North Dakota and South Dakota I Know not many people are there but some of them that are there and listen to money talk\nIn places like Fargo in Sioux Falls and others and I can tell you right now\nThere's a big difference in state income tax between North Dakota and South Dakota because South Dakota doesn't have any\nSo you have this situation all over the country Georgia and Florida very very good example high state income tax no state income tax this is a situation all over the country people are going to look at this now because this can be really big money for a high earner\nAnd so people can look at this and say this makes a big difference\nSo these are the kinds of considerations that people will continue to make and it's just logic it's basic logic to expect people to ignore this would be to expand ... suspect people not to care about their money will people do care about their money\nClark is on the line in Baton Rouge shuttle clerk\nYeah hello thanks for taking my call itself\nA bit retires since June of twenty eleven and a half kept the majority of a bond funds and a stable value fond of that time frame it goes a low interest rates and\nIt's worked out pretty good but it looks like me\nIt's time to be changed by strategy and start moving into your low duration income funds because I've been doing that with some of my money for a couple of years that I noticed that ah I'm making about twice as much as by stable by you\nAnd a cat or the that that's going to improve over time going forward [noise] so I just wanted to get a second opinion mute does it make sense maybe start ...\nThat it should stay normalize what is your stable than you are paying you\nIt's paying me right at the last last year it was to herself and they're all a rated phones are contracts\nAnd you have no risk your principal at all\nVery very little\nYeah\nWell it's a it's a very tough it's a very tough question to answer and I'll tell you why [noise] uh\nIt's very difficult to know going forward what the rates of return are going to be because of the propensity of interest rates to reflect what's going on in the economy and thereby for the fed to reflect what's going on in the economy with reference to interest rate in monetary policy so it's a it's a very very tough call\nTo make a for recall on what the income portfolio is going to earn and but it's very difficult to make that kind of a projection versus what you seem to be saying is a guaranteed two percent\n[noise] yeah and ... and ... it ... at the beginning of my retirement\nIt was much better than that it was around for and there but yeah as these contracts mature you know they lack the interest rates going down so\nYou know the returns of slowly degraded in one day when they write stark normalize and go back up the same thing's going to happen and I got to go up very fast and you have a point in time I got to figure out what I made the switch and\nWell I maybe that maybe there will be a time clerk when you can make that kind of a judgment but my response to your question right now is it's a very very tough comparison to make based on what we know right now and I do appreciate the call\nThis is
