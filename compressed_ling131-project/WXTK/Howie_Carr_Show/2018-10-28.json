I was raised ... pardon me in on ranchers and stuff like that here\nBut because I was an article in the wall Street Journal they were talking about how barn photos are just huge it was like wow\nThey are never thought of that are that are on you know so so if you\nKnowing that you know her pictures obviously are burned photos even look at buying Google Ads\nAnd we did we just set that up or yeah that the U.S\nYou know Facebook as you can buy as well ah\nShe's done that in the U.S but it doesn't always drive up you know the and did it out there like you would expect it to her\n... you know the other thing that she can do is that if you have a mailing list you're you've ... you know where you're doing email marketing off of is that you can tie that list into Facebook and so what that means is that because Facebook has everybody's email addresses that are you\nAnd say you know here's my list of email address is find them on the site and then\nShow them this ad for a discount coupon and then that would work so don't do the pilots to stick with the clever boots marketing and I think you'll be better off thanks for your call come right back about wireless chargers you're on the Kim commando show\nOn just asking for a friend of course can I ask you a question Kim yes I watch the video on your tongue not story yes what do you think is going to be safer\nA ton of his car on the road with all their cars that aren't or a drone that picks you up Patricia Walmart\nWhat do you think I think I Would feel safer and I don't know if it is safer but I definitely would feel safer being on the road even though the cars around me are being driven by humans and when I'm In is being driven by a computer\nI Would I Would be really nervous getting into that drone self driving from drone taxi doesn't know pilot just given the he'd\nBe cheap east yeah it doesn't have any airbags\nOkay at least if the car crashes maybe there's an airbag sure there's a chance okay then it goes Eighteen miles looked you know as well as I Do that sometime here I phoned works long after that and other times twenty five percent sometimes means and our twenty five percent of my eye to eye that's why I said I wouldn't go more than ten miles no\nI've ... just it's OK\nAnd just not and only two people so this way you can freak out together no I'm I'm not good but you always ever you know you would never get it I saw the videos like may be no no I'm I've decided no ... speaking of Walmart it's almost time to get your shopping started for Christmas and let me tell you the\nRetailers are hopping into action Walmart is going to be trying to take you away from Amazon dot com is how they're going to do it they're an offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now right and they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership fade and take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return label from your online Wal Mart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Walmart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore are going to start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine does this whenever he goes to Wal Mart went announcement comes on over the loudspeaker\nHe it gets into the fetal position he screams no no no it's those voices again [laughter] what's this cat uh I I I walked out when he did that I'm like I don't even know you I'm Sorry [noise] and then there's also target\nThey're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they say hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free to day shipping a target dot com [noise] All right so Walmart says we're going to give you a free to day shipping\nTargets as we can give you free to day shipping on select items a target also has a few ... do you have to use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody's saying wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime\nTargets as we have another idea they had to drive up surface okay shoppers can place their orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car and it's going to be available\nAt a thousand stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody a target thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're going by a target is still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car or is this just go into prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered\nThat day it seems even with the grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who did they fight fries oh price okay you have to do it like fourteen hours in advance\nWhy bother you know I go to a prime now the ... the prime now that I was on a ... I was like three PM and by five thirty I have fresh salmon fresh vegetables\nAnd I bet you know here's the difference though is that I was at my sister's house was mentioned and we needed to buy buy some stuff for dinner and she said well I'll just go over to whole foods I said no you know let me show you how this works because she's not that computer savvy try\n... prime now and she's like well why would I buy all this on line I can just go to get my car and go to the store\nAnd like well Christie and they don't have to go to the store you know you're just going to come to you and she was going to now she went to whole foods she said she likes to go to whole foods but speaking of target you know what we've been talking about my because Mike\nAsked election and Mary and things like that like he might get this is actually a good idea for you is that you go to target to okay can you address nice for work right so you go to target what do you think about it or\nYou go to the dollar spot right there in the front door the front yeah just where they have everything for a dollar and\nYou just hang out there might but you're going to find a cube woman and you know that she likes to bargain\nShop OK cheap day that's what I Need great ideas\nSpeaking of money there's a bizarre new trend happening online I don't know if you heard about this it's called the flaunt your wealth challenge to flaunt your will challenge it's generated millions of post that actually started in China\nAnd so basically uh what you do is you pretend that you have fallen out of some thing with all

Barbie doll and go ahead and and talk to the kids and then everything that the kids said was an unencrypted servers right so he was part of the reason why he probably was the reason why that now Patel had I'd go ahead and lock everything down\nYeah and in exactly that his podcast as kind of opens the doors and and just kind of opens their minds to that um you know thinking about those types of things\nAnd then our other a podcast we have as you've mentioned before the golden age of radio\nUm which I Am a super big fan of vintage radio shows I listen to them on the way in and out of the golden Rachel age of radio it's radio shows from the thirties the forties and fifties my personal favorite is yours truly Johnny Dollar listen to it I thought on it really is really good um how\nDo how do you do that because you know those were we cereals and so do we put up part one two three four or five right\nWe do and there's a lot of standalone episodes but uh some of them particular do roll over you know five parts and we do we put up all all five parts for each of those so yeah it's really good and then um you know we've had our starting line pod cast which is something we're going to be um uh dedicating a little more to and\nAnd just kind of bringing 'em you know stories of fortune five hundred companies how they've started\nIn love I this is my favorite podcast okay 'cause I interviewed a CEO this past week and he told me a story that his little neighborhood is but if you'll have to listen to the ... uh but he was telling me the story about how the like his main product\nWas in his trash cat I mean the company was in almost on the verge of bankruptcy and his main product was in the trash can cause he said it was never amount to anything and then\nSomebody

earn some extra money on line legitimate way well look further than commando dot com 'cause we are going to tell you\nHow you can be a caregiver a nanny a companion piece of ... you can drive you can do tall small tasks are odd jobs for you can work on line for Amazon dot com\n\nYou're investing in in in the case of a lot of these accounts by the way you can invest off the top before taxes for maximum earnings value that way you defer the taxation all the way out to your retirement years\nSo you're accumulating your wealth in baby steps in order to get rich slowly\nAnd that's the way to do it in my opinion\nNow there are other types of accounts like Roth IRAs where you don't get that\nTax you don't get a money taken off the top you're putting after tax money into a Roth IRA re the benefit is as long as you follow the rules the score and you're going to grow tax free for you you don't have to pay taxes on it when you take it out\nBut either way the whole idea is the same idea to take at least ten percent of what you're making and put it into these types of the couch\n\nWe've talked also on the program about maximizing your tax deferred investments\nThat means you're four one K. for all three before the sevens your IRAs all of these programs these tax privilege to uh programs are great way for you to build wealth over time all the way out to you're going to take it out way down the road\nSo that's another very important part of managing your money and building up toward reaching critical mass\nAlso very important to understand the difference between the ashes and income because really over the long term it's the assets that will make the difference in your life\nNow the income is the vehicle that allows you\nTo acquire your assets in your net worth over your lifetime\nBut income can be fleeting\nA person could mean making an excellent income something happens to them and then they can't do it anymore well there goes the income\nLook at these uh professional athletes we read about these players these professional athletes athletes a lot has been said about the athletes in the NFL\nWhere they'll make a huge amount of money over a short period of time and then unfortunately many of them have filed bankruptcy within ... years of retirement from they're relatively short careers\nAssets versus income very important to never be confused on that point never to misunderstand words because income is here while you're earning it and that's wonderful but it's not the same as assets as this can be used\nTo generate income for the rest of your life that's a big deal that's critical mass\nWhen you put together the asset based including your tax privileged accounts\nThat will provide for you the ability\nTo earn income and interest income in the form of interest and also dividends for the rest of your life that the value of assets and that's the contribution that the assets make in reaching the land a critical mass\nAnd we're we've also talked about managing your money from the top down yes you'll have these different accounts but you also have the ability to manage your money from the top down so that you can make judgments about things like diversification\nThings like asset allocation\nVery very important to be able to do that in the top down management approach which is the one we like to think about here on Mondays talk\nMoney [noise]\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that's eight hundred three

someone like yours to recommend something like that to me\nHow do I get my hands on the current investment income or those just dividends and interest that I've received somehow without selling my shares of my other re\nWell you're absolutely right bill that model portfolio one which is an aggressive growth portfolio has a it's really not um designed to generate current income is designed to generate growth\nAnd ah it certainly has done that or if you look at the performance table or you will see that over the long term those portfolios have uh done extremely well\nNow model three would

I'm about five years from retirement\nAnd what are the options that we have in our fond of wondering if you could help me is a it's an income on it is a stable value fun but it is not a mutual fund\nOn it provides seek a secure rate of return risk to invest in principle and things when I look at the portfolio analysis\nIt said that Seventy percent made up of synthetic kicks and thirty percent of traditional ... can you explain those too\nYeah I'm the thirty percent of traditional kicks a gift being a ... a\nGenerally unused acronym for guaranteed investment contracts I prefer the letter\nBut uh the thirty percent in guarantee and investment contracts means that they have contracts in place to earn a specified rate of interest over a specified term\nFor thirty percent of the portfolio the Seventy percent of synthetic guaranteed investment contracts means that these are are contracts that have been constructed a probably using various forms of the resident derivatives\nThat's what scares me [noise]\nAll right now what kind of ... what kind of a yield there's the ... right now\nCurrently three point five and the other thing that concerns me Bob is when I look at the top ten holdings\nBasically it's three insurance companies they're all well known great and I am ... ratings uh but you know I Know you're for protests when I only see three and a top and it just kind of scares me\nTo impossible or impossible to analyze that on the radio given the fact that they've already told you that Seventy percent of the fund is synthetic\nGuaranteed investment contracts that becomes very very difficult to analyze when they express it that way that might explain though\n[noise] the reason that it shielding three and a half percent\nAnd so the point of it is my guess is that by developing these synthetic guaranteed investment contracts they're able to earn to offer a higher yield does that suggest that there could be an element of risk there and maybe it's an element of risk that you're not comfortable with which by the way would be perfectly understandable\nUh from my point of view\nPerfectly understandable\nFact of the matter is that um stable value funds in general\nAre can be difficult to analyze\nAnd I'm One of the problems was stable value funds as people ... back in two thousand eight is you know they're okay until they're not right and then all of a sudden you have a problem so ah I think that if you're going to invest in a stable value fund especially one with the ... that much above the market that's above the ten year treasury\nWell a ten year treasury does not provide stable now you because the price of attend your tenure treasury can be highly vulnerable specially when rates change and uh not to your benefit when rates are going up\nSo you have to be careful with this stuff because ah it's not always what it appears to be\nA treasury bills treasury bill a AAA commercial paper as a AAA commercial paper uh\nAs

about a pensions I'm a uh I'm fifty six and a half I'm eligible to receive a pension payment of her time in service when I hit\nSixty and I intend to take that and are they call in or benefits they said that a pension is a backed up by the pension benefit guarantee corporation by pensions going to be about thirty four hundred a month and\nUh that are looking up information on the ... looks like a for payments for twenty Eighteen on those are guaranteed for about thirty five hundred a month and benefits said they're guaranteed for after about five thousand a month I question for you is that I have anything\nTo worry about as far as that to income stream that portion of my income income stream and retirement\n[noise]\nWell uh it would seem to me that any pension that you have earned would be dependent on their ability to meet their pension obligations is that makes sense do you\nMake sense to me and I was that stand right now\nYou know they've they've been under stress their attention a obligations are underfunded but um [noise] that from what I understood that\nAre that the pension benefit guarantee corpus somewhat of an analogous to FDIC insurance that\nAh it's paid for by companies that participate and you're not if you have a ... a large pension or let's say whatever eighty grant or something like that it that that's not going to be covered but after a certain amount you are going to be Catholic am I Am I correct in that or am I mistaken\nI Would say this that I'm thirty four hundred dollars a month that's an annual pension of over forty thousand dollars a year\nSo what I what I Would check would be what the limits or on the pension benefit guarantee corporation payouts relative to what you are expecting because I mean that's what's going to determine if and if this thing winds up in the hands of a\nPension benefit guarantee then the question is will you get all or most of what you were expecting so I wouldn't choir at pension benefit guarantee to see what their limits are and and how that would compare to your situation\n[noise] yeah this\nUh this money at age sixty it it would be\nA about like maybe thirty five percent of my income stream that I counted on at sixty\nSo I mean I had uh my uh four one K. and my IRA money is is basically index fans like at the desk that I can with your choice as a model year up your act to pass it portfolio in my own personal investments are but I mean this this uh\nThis money uh would come in handy you know and and I I just want to see if it's something that I have to have to plan on and like you said I Will look up look up the government website and look up pension benefit guarantee and yeah and and\nSee what the details are yeah that's what I Would do but I mean I my guess would be the worst case and this is only a guess but worst case which seemed to me you'd be likely to get\nEven with pension benefit guarantee you'd be likely to get a really good chunk of that pension income\nWorst case\nThat that sort of kinda sounded like it\nKinda sounded like from the tables the information that I looked up yeah uh that for him out on and on the I'm looking to be paid that I'd be pretty much covered and find out what it sounds like you look good that is the pension benefit guarantee is somewhat of an allegation to an FDIC insurance [noise]\nWell I think there are I don't like that get a let me tell you why I don't like the comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel\nNobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC or they have a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured amount up to the insurance limit\nAnd I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earned was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a get a pension that gets\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay up okay you've answered my question\nIt started there uh it depends on how much money you're investing but you can get started there if you wanted to just get started initially with the minimum

plans\nAnd by the way if you're older than fifty years of age you can put in another six thousand for a total of twenty four thousand five hundred now we're talking about two thousand forty one

Y. so that you get the privilege of paying a five percent or so commission\nWell that's no prevalent at all some people would look upon that more as a rip off so with the closed in funds once you get that net assets value at a at the same price as the share price then you have parity\nFrequently you'll see discounts in a closed and mutual fund because the price of the shares is completely dependent on supply and demand in the marketplace because they trade like stuck\nAnd so it's quite common for a close and mutual fund to trade at a discount sometimes they'll trade at a premium in either case the net assets value is what it is underlying shares\nAnd that brings us back to that third category which is the more recent a category and that's the exchange traded mutual fund so anytime you hear E.

fund is priced on the clothes every business day\nAnd can be trends acted purchased or redeemed on that price every day whereas the exchange traded mutual fund the ATF\nThat's trading all during the trip a trading day depending on which exchanges listed on so these are the fine points the key points to know\nWhen you're talking about mutual funds open ended mutual funds which are priced to trends act at the clothes each day based on the net assets value of the securities within the fun\nAnd they can be no low which means you do pay a commission to buy a redeem or they can be low which means you get hit over there was a kid they should either to buy or to redeem and I see no reason to go down that road\nThen the second category the closed and mutual funds that we talked about in detail
