explaining Saturdays deadly limousine accident in upstate New York everyone inside the limousine was killed state police jeopardy super data ... there were Eighteen people in that limo and to pedestrians they were all killed and skill Harry West of Albany\nOver time\nAnd of course was a number of the programs that are offered the traditional lie or raise the traditional four one K. programs good examples you're investing off the top you're investing the money that you earned off the top before taxes\nHave been taken out and that gives you maximum earnings value in your tax privileged to count all the way out in many cases decades down the line\nYour retirement years so you accumulate your wealth really gradually no get rich quick ideas you accumulate your wealth gradually you in other words you get rich slowly\nAnd over a period of time it works it's a wonderful way\nPlan for the future now if you can afford to put more than ten percent of your earnings aside this way this wonderful by all means do it but the idea of the ten percent goal isn't it is a basic goal to shoot for of course if you want to put more that's fine\nAnd this is all in the context of something else we've talked about over the years on Monday talk which is known as quantum leap\nThinking\nOf quantum leap thinking is important because it helps you to develop a long term mindset\nAbout sure money a\nLong term mindset about your financial goals and allows you to think depending on your age and allows you to think about where you want to be financially\n\nYears down the road things that you can do to make positive\nThings happen for yourself and for the benefit of your family\nOvertime and this idea\nOf developing the proper mindset is really important\nBecause without this mindset\nYou may never be able to overcome the daily worries that are always in the marketplace\nAnd usually serve as distractions\nYou see them all the time and the new slow the daily worries and you really have to\nOvercome\nAnd a great way to overcome that is to develop the quantum leap thinking mindset about where you want to be years down the road the steps you can take to make that happen we just talked about a very important one pay yourself first\nIf you can afford it the first ten percent or even more of what you earn goes into your\nInvestment programs for the future taxed for tax privilege programs can be very positive in that regard as well we've talked about the four oh one cage the four o three bees the four fifty seven plans that work\nWe've talked about using the IRA programs and the other tax privileged programs that help you to build wealth over your\nLifetime because the whole idea here is that when it's all said and done\nYou are in the land of critical mass and that means that you're going to enjoy life as you prefer to enjoy life\nYou're going to own your time that's the big deal here there is a big deal here that's it you're going to own your own time you're going to allocate your time the way you want to spend it\nAnd the way you're going to support all of this financially is by being as a land a critical mass\nAnd so aside from any income you may have earned in terms of deferred income in terms of a pension in terms of Social Security all of those things in addition to any of that\nYou have a portfolio you have an investment portfolio\nWhich at the point here in the land a critical mass and you're a you're moving on your own time schedule you're not working anymore\nWell at that point\nYou should be able to put in a withdrawal regimen on your portfolio I suggest starting out with a four percent guideline for your initial year of withdrawal once you reach this point\nAnd you're going to find if you have a balanced portfolio\nOf equities and fixed income securities you're going to find that most of the money that you're going to withdraw on an annual basis is going to be self generating\nAs a result of the evidence paid in stocks in your portfolio and you know low funds for example\nThat are passed through through the funds and also the interest that you're earning\nOn the interest portion of your gums portfolio\nAnd so when you add up all the evidence that are paid from the equities and you add up all the interest is paid from the fixed income you're going to find that most of that four percent and you will withdraw guideline it's going to come from dividends and interest\nThere will be some years where capital gains distributions from your equity funds will bring you to a point where you've exceeded four percent you certainly can reinvest that money if you would like to in your portfolio that's fine\nYou'll have some years where capital gains distributions will bring you basically around that four percent number combined with dividends and interest there may be some years for sure\nWhere you'll have to liquidate a small a small amount of shares in order to break yourself to four percent\nBut the whole idea behind the ... percent withdrawal is very simple it's very clear and it's very basic here it is\nWhere do we come up with the idea that we can withdraw four percent on a balanced portfolio no balanced portfolio purely a pure ballads portfolio would have half of the money and the stock market I prefer no load funds or exchange traded mutual funds for that\nAnd half of the money and fixed income securities were right now I prefer short duration because there's no reason there's no reason to take long duration securities with rates at this level\nAnd so what happens is you have this boundless portfolio and you're collecting the data and there's an interest every year and that's how you're getting to your four percent throwing in your capital gains distributions as I said some years you'll even\nHave more than four percent you can reinvest the access if you choose I think it's a good idea to do that kind of a rainy day approach to it\n\nAnd here you are you

money lenders we are rolling along on the flight of the starship Monday talk at one eight hundred ninth reports Monty to Twenty one let's get up the Schoenberg Illinois Mike welcome to the program\nHello Mike yes how are you are doing well what's up uh I have a\nQuick question are we sell some property and they have about a a fifty thousand cash to use a little torn I Want to get your views on this\nUh between uh putting it against the mortgage or our primary residence or putting it into the market if so where I'm at I'm and I'm In my mid thirties save a lot of time ahead of me but I\nWant to make sure do I buy down or the debt that I have and reduce my my mortgage about my interest or do I put it against the market is that a better use\nLet's talk about uh let's talk about this loan that you have on your principles residents are first of all how much is the residents work what some are marketed\nThat are probably about a 'bout to sixty and uh I have about a hundred and Seventy three left on it I Want to get it down with the fifty thousand I have to work with down to about one twenty three and I'm at right now it's at four sixty five\nThe the rate of the field is we're seeing now on the mortgage the mortgage okay\nWell that's pretty generous ah that's pretty generous four point six but you see the thing about that is\nThat when you ... pay\nA four point six five percent mortgage you are you guarantee yourself\nThat you're going to make that because you're not paying it right\nSo it's like a guaranteed income four point six but and I would have to say that's pretty generous in today's world when you have to put it in context the ten year treasury and here's the context how many years remain on your mortgage\nUh probably about fourteen dollars more in a sari about twenty four twenty four\nWell here's the thing I ten year treasury right now is yielding to and seven eight percent okay that's that's one and three quarter percent less than the guaranteed return you receive one repaying four point six five\nSo I think that um I I think that might be very attractive but first I'd like to ask you what do you have in terms of an investment portfolio I'm\nPretty good I have my four one K. were actually both do we have are falling case and we have some other individual investments to so probably a a total value a hundred and fifty thousand\nYeah well I'll tell you what my my response my response to this question Mike is yeah definitely it's definitely a conservative response I think it would have to be classified as a conservative too conservative response\nBut it would also have I also have to say that I think there's something that today's world right now at today's investment world right now I think there's something to be set\nFor having a conservative response from time to time and I think this is one of those times if I were you I Would prepay that four point six by\nOkay okay good uh that's kinda the way we're leaning cars and market is is you know relatively high now and I didn't know if there was enough return to really justify putting it in the marketplace and you know\nRead ... let me let me be clear about what I'm saying what I'm saying what I'm saying is you were looking at a guaranteed return no risk of four point six five percent\nAnd I'm saying in a world where the ten year is yielding to in seventies now where the thirty year where the thirty year is not yielding much more than that\nI'm going to take a guaranteed no risk four point six five percent and that is the basis for that view I Do appreciate it might thanks so much for calling\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one Charles is on the line in Gary Indiana Charles welcome the Monday talk\nHow you're doing Bob thank you for taking my call doing well thanks [noise] uh this is the second time I've had an opportunity to speak to you\nAh one was several years ago approximately Seventy years ago a draw a line than Oprah picks\nA we had a lot of fun there in ah Chicago land or thanks for coming out I Do appreciate that what what is on your mind today\nI'm approximately thirty or a mutual funds versus a bonds\nI in fact Kevin very serious question because I've come across some information OR Insight in reference to have you on your opening speech you made a statement in regards to the\n... someone sixty seven years old ... do you see is at this juncture when in fact the market is reaching all time high would they\nLet me up and let me ask you let me ask you a question uh now that you mentioned age are you thinking in terms of retirement at any time\nOh I'm retired been retired you as you\nWell then let's start out by saying I Am way more comfortable way more comfortable\nAt that point of having a a balanced portfolio which would start out basically with a fifty fifty allegations so your application would be different than the allocation I Would choose in that situation\nEven though I'm at Seventy Seventy eight thirty to meet you and what\nDo your your you said you were Seventy percent equities I think is that right\nNo no no no I'm I'm Seventy percent neutral Mosul mutual follows\nYou have a check writing ability a two hundred fifty dollars or more in all cases you a check writing ability and that's a great way to have a money market account with liquidity with check writing\nSo that's my favorite way to invest short term money and if you're making less than that right now wherever you're keeping the money I certainly would give that some consideration for great\nCan't tell you one other thing I forgot to mention really important sure and another one of your favorite topics I Do happen to be a product of a Illinois kick your accent for hacking mentioned that age\nUm now what kind of pension is that what kind of a pension does that produce\nThat produces Seventy thousand a year\nOkay so that's certainly\nBy the time that gets me is like forty thousand a month right now\nYeah so you put a lot of years for that I'm sure\nI get\nOkay so I'm All right so we have that and that's very important and what that might do it that provides you more income than you need a that might mean that\nYou don't have to do a full four percent withdrawal you might do a lesser amount in withdrawal which helps the overall integrity in longevity of your portfolio for example even or even reducing the amount from four percent to three percent\nAs a marine laws of the ... has a very positive long term effect in terms of sustainability and and longevity and the integrity of the of the whole uh program just reducing it from four percent the three percent the only reason I mentioned that is\nA if you take three percent of tour of a well actually above half a billion now with this new money\nOr you know that starts to add up into real money\nSo uh you take three percent of that on top of the Seventy one thousand maybe all you need and you know maybe not ... percent\nSo I say hey they need the three well in that case it in that case you might want to take two I I wouldn't take zero but you might want to take to that in that case but I find I have\nUm I Would not take zero because well let me put it this way let me rephrase that I wouldn't take zero forever okay that's that's what I mean does it matter matter if you take a zero for\nA few years so right because you have this other income I I Would not have a mindset where I'm never going to take any money out of my investment portfolio because I I don't think that there's any reason to because I mean I what I don't want you to do is wind up being the richest person in the cemetery\n\nAnd you've run that risk if you take zero forever than you do run that risk and there were people with that\nWith that the classification there there are people there right now with that classification and so I don't want you to do that so uh yeah I Would think of course right now here in you have this income you're fine but longer term you might think about gradually uh doing some withdraw\nI think in a fixed income portion of the portfolio\nOf that fifty percent into percentage column to send a fixed income portion I don't have any problem with investing that because we have a we have largely inoculated that portfolio against interest rate risk\nBy reducing the duration do ah ah basically well less than one year and when you have a duration that's that short you've done all\nSome ... on a lot of an occupation on interest rates risk\nSo in the event interest rates do go haywire um than you would have a ... you'd have a situation there where you wouldn't get destroyed by rising interest rates so I think the on the interest rate on a fixed income side portion I'm fine putting it in on the equity portion I Would take a dollar cost averaging approach\nA and a lot there have been multiple bouts of weakness this year or you can always just take a dollar cost averaging approach you and whether you use periods of weakness or not\nUh you're putting in small amounts of money over a longer period of time but I Would not be inclined or were twenty eight fifty in is the five hundred\nWere within one percent of the record I Would not be inclined at this time to be some kind of a lump sum throw it all in investor that's not my inclination at this time I Would prefer a dollar cost averaging approach\nTo win thank you for the call it's always great to hear\nFrom the mighty WLS Chicago right here on Monday talk [noise]\nMoney talks\nAttention all authors page publishing is

thousand Seventeen or took a tumble in fact it was down a approximately ten percent\nFrom its a January two thousand Seventeen high uh after that period of decline\nBut uh it more recently it has been doing better the dollar has has not recovered all of it hasn't recovered the entire decline started in January two thousand Seventeen but it has it has ...\nSilverdome meaningful portion\nOf the decline that occurred starting in January two thousand Seventeen now what happens is when did you start investing in this month by the way\nI January Bob\nUh well it's ironic if you had started investing in a fund in January of two thousand Seventeen\nYou would have had the opposite question absolutely yeah you would have called in and you you would have said I've noticed this bond is doing very well how much of how well it's doing is because of currency and I was told you the dollar has been getting rocked because it got rocked in two thousand Seventeen went down substantially\nAnd that float through to the benefit of an international fund that that is dealing in local currencies\nAnd now the opposite is true the dollar has been rebounding and it has the opposite effect on

I I like about money in the event guard total bond index fund investors shares and I thought I heard you say a couple of weeks ago\nYou felt the duration of that fund was too long and there's a lot of the interest rate risk by keeping the money there\nWell the interest rate risk is ah it's really not a mystery the fund has the duration of six years so okay in any event that rates go up one percent the fund would lose about six percent in it as a value know shielding three percent so over let's say over one year's time\nIt would earn a three percent rate of interest if the if rates went up one percent it would lose about six percent now that said value so would have a negative return of about three percent or you know some bond investors don't care about that now that said values so you have to decide whether you care not\nWell I guess [laughter] it's like it's about a third of my four one K. down so I guess I Do care and I have the option of moving to the vanguard prime money market fund\nYeah well I Would be more comfortable there because that fund is yielding over two percent and you're not taking interest rate risk with that fund uh it depends on a\nReally whether you have any concern that rates might rise I mean we're getting work huh do you\nI I certainly do\nOh well I mean that's depending on your concern of what you want to do about it what I've done about it is a taken duration really to inoculate the portfolios\nAgainst interest rate risk largely has just taken duration way down to under one year part of that is using that fund you mentioned the vanguard prime money market which has zero duration and as he yelled of over two percent another thing I like about that fund is as the fed continues to raise rates as they will again I expect the next month\nThe guilt on that fund continues to rise with the short term rate hikes that are implemented\nA orchestrated by the Federal Reserve and are likely to continue into two thousand Nineteen so you know for a lot of reasons I liked that fund as very low expenses as an excellent yield it has a zero duration it has great liquids day including check writing\nSo ah no I mean I think that's a great place to uh to use for a short term duration for income and for staying away from interest rate risk I think it's a it's a good point\n[noise] great well thank you so much Bob\nThank you I might say also a really good point raised there by Nelson in Beaverton or there's something going on here that you want to keep your eye on and that is the um\nCatch twenty two a catch twenty two risk and let me talk about the catch twenty two risk\nAnd uh explain what I'm Talking about\nNow as I recall the book [noise] catch twenty two as I recall the uh the\nThe would be pilot goes to his commander and says uh I Can't fly these missions because I'm Crazy and I'm paraphrasing here and\nSimplifying and as a recall the commander says well then\nYou're the perfect candidate to flood the missions because you have to be crazy to\nBlood these missions and that\nTurns out to be the catch twenty two well the catch twenty two that I'm Talking about\nHas to do with uh what's happening\nWith interest rates short term and long term\nAs we know that as long as the economy is growing and I believe that the economy's fine right now\nAs long as the economy's growing and I speak of the U.S economy when I say that then we know that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates\nAnd uh they're likely to raise rates several times through next year if the economy continues to grow\nAnd uh\nSo we know that the short term rate federal funds rate the a three month treasure bill rate they're going higher\nAnd most likely they will go higher in one quarter of one percent increments into next year the next two which I expect in September ... September federal open market committee meeting\nSo that's kind of baked in a cake if the economy contests\nUsed to grow we consider that baked indicate that rich continue to rise in the short term and what about longer term rich what about the ten year rate I mentioned the ten year rate has more than doubled in the last two years from one in three days to two and seven eighths what happens to longer rates like ten year rates going forward well\n\nIf longer rates rise this certainly would make sense given the fact that if you combine real GDP Growth with inflation right now you could justify a four point eight percent ten year certainly a four percent plus\nI think\nSo you're you're thinking that the money that you're the pre tax money that you're contributing is really not give you much of a benefit at all\nI guess it does because if not let's say that\nYou know we're being taxed one eighty thousand I think\nThat maybe\nI didn't want to wait it out here I don't know maybe that's what I Know when you put it that way we are getting that much but then it out of it\nWell it would be interesting to see the numbers and you want to throw Delaware in there too because you have a state income tax in Delaware as well um I Know these things 'cause I was born and raised in Philadelphia not far from where you are\nSo I Would say that um you want to check out the numbers and see how they work but I Would say this with with reference to any additional money you're you're putting in that\nYou want to see whether you're getting a benefit from the additional money you put in and I was really talking more about the additional money that you were referring to that you would put it in because if you're not getting much of a benefit pre tax then why not use a Roth right\nTrue and I can never be one thing well I guess seven years\nI don't know how much it's going to build up we don't end up meeting that I guess it could actually more than\nLet's say eight years when he retired we don't have such that\nWe don't have to draw off I mean you know quick grow another Thirty years\nWell I like the diversification aspect too I mean you already have the traditional Z so why not put a little money in a Roth I'm okay with it\nOkay very good for your health\nClara you're from northern Delaware right yeah\nI hear your Philadelphia accent\n[laughter] people say we I I don't notice it but everyone says oh I guess it's true\nThere are a handful of people in the audience that knows that I'm from Philadelphia by my accent I don't know how they do that because I spent my life eliminated again you hear it in my you hear it in my speech\nNot it may I ask you one other question while I have I'm sure you get you\nDown the road it's not an immediate question but I guess I'd rather think about it if I have nothing else my father would say don't worry about but one day I'm going to inherit my parents but I'm living in a line that I'm living on winning debating\nFriends that where we always happening where am I better get rates are going to stay as well as they are right now we really wouldn't make anything with it a\nClear I Would I Would I Would just for all thought on that matter until later\nAll right nice player I take care Bye bye this is talk [noise]\nMoney [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty

deputy superintendent Chris Fiore\nBecause these rate hikes passed right through to these types of short term instruments same applies to three month treasury bills\nAre right now a three month treasury bills have the yield\nIt's the same as the vanguard prime money market right around two point five which is why I like to thank our prime money market better because\nYou have that check writing privilege in their protects of two fifty or more you have that much to do that comes with it that you don't get it in a CD you don't get that but with a daily liquidity in check writing and all that in the CD you don't get that\nUm but you do get that in the prime money market fund\nSo I'm should be interesting to see how that plays out\nBut uh\nThe federal open market committee is expected to raise rates again at the September meeting on Thursday\nWe will get jobless claims now these are new unemployment claims compiled each week and they show the number of persons who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time\nAnd um\nFor example if you have an increasing trend in this data\nThan that suggest a deterioration in the labor market we have not had that\nWe have had a very healthy trend of a flat lining at a very low level data series now the consensus for this Thursday is two hundred Fifteen thousand last week it was ten to twelve thousand the four week moving average\nWhich smooths out the weekly volatility right now stands at two hundred and Fifteen thousand five hundred these are very low levels\nWe're talking about levels here that compare to levels as far back as\nAlmost fifty years ago that's how they are now they've been low for several years the last three years have been incredibly low but they've stayed low\nOr one of the things going on out there as we have a tight labor market right now we've seen the increase in people leaving their jobs to find another job\nAnd that's because people feel confident that they can get a better job\nAnd all of that is happening as a result of a very strong labor market out there very strong so strong that we now have more job openings than qualified applicants we have plenty of job openings we don't have the qualified applicants to fill them\nSo that's going on out there as well\nAlso on Thursday we'll get the federal housing Finance Agency the S H if a house price index and that will update for us the year over year rate of change in housing prices\nAnd I'm right now it's standard six point for\nHouse prices right now are on average six point four percent higher than they were twelve months ago\nSo I'm\nNot a lot of change by the way not a lot of changes expected in that six point for figure on a year over year\nBasis as a result of this a report\nAlso on Thursday we will get the new home sales figure new home sales for the month of July and these are measured by counting the number of newly constructed homes with a committed sailed during the month of July\nSo uh this is a very important number because new homes contributed a lot to the economy new home sales\nContribute a lot to the economy so this is a big deal comes up Thursday a system aged at six hundred forty eight thousand prior month was six hundred thirty one thousand\nAnd um\nI think the market would like to see a better number on a new home sales because recently it's been some sluggish miss some sluggish mission these figures so that number will come out on Thursday and also what's going on of course is the annual\nJackson Hole economics impose you this is in Jackson Hole Wyoming one of the

economy were old jobs are obsolete and freelancing is the future of the you mentioned uh the ratings are that are becoming more and more prevalent in all various disciplines and of course as you know\nOr the colleges and universities in particular that rating systems for the most part in place for years hasn't worked out the other they use them and do they even look at them\nAre you talking specifically about things like SATs\nWell I'm Talking now about the the ... the teacher ratings service oh ... online\nSure and and you know even as a instructor at a University of California Irvine I get rented every single\nEvery single time that I teach\nWhat's interesting about those ratings is they're done on a particular skill and um\nThe scale itself basically anything other than five stars as a fail\nRight and that's true I think when we look at places to stay to like when we look at an air being beer we look at some of these other rating system\nWe start to see that we tend to either go towards the extremes on one enter the extremes on the other hand we're looking more towards those you know four and a half star\nType of experience is so the rating systems themselves aren't necessarily new I think what's new is the breath and the depths of them\nYou know when I learned that these five guys burgers and fries managers were getting reviewed by their temporary help I mean that's a game changer when have you ever heard that\nIs that a good thing it can be\nIt can be it may lead to man that certain types of managers treating people maybe a little bit better because now there are also under the microscope you know but it also\nHas the other parts of it too you know there are certain reviews are known for being quite fraudulent you know I'm Talking about wide scale reviews and you know you talked to any small business owner and they'll tell you about how Yelp is not the most reliable and\nYet we all choose that way so what does that say about us when we're in a new place we're looking for somewhere to eat\nOr one of the things you're always thinking about when you're checking those kinds of ratings on a restaurant or a place to stay is you're always wondering uh how much of that is legitimate honest input and it's some of the perhaps a promoted by the establishment itself in their favor\nRight right and I think there is a certain degree of that as well and it's hard for us to know sometimes as the consumer except for when we start to see patterns right like if we're we're looking at an Amazon review\nAnd we go to the person that reviewed and we noticed that they only write reviews for one particular company and that's all they've ever written we start to be a little bit wary\nA lot of these systems in place like certain Google reviews and even Yelp for that matter you know they they do try to keep their reviews as honest as possible to try to kind of\nA head off all of the fraudulent ones that can come through they do put in systems there how good they are you know that's always up for debate but I think most of us would agree that we prefer to have them rather than not\nWhat a great way to trash the competition a I mean uh just go on and and put nasty comments on line about your competition that sounds like a a positive step for a competitor what do you think of that idea\nI don't know about that I've seen that actually happened in my past life I'm ...\nUh where you know like there was let's say there's two companies right like Sony and ... and one trashing the other one the TV's 'em and they're both doing it you know um but uh again this is all the ... the buyer beware scenario I don't think ends\nUp but I Do I Do feel like there is more information for us it's a question of how you want to use that\nBob is on the line in San Francisco above you are on the line with Olga go ahead\n[noise] I bought a old guy wanted to ask you a baby boomer of course so things have changed at breakneck pace for my generation with regard to the Internet and all things associated with it\nA as a millennial I presume a new author of this book and you see a instructor if you have that\nChances are better than the time and go back to the old model a worker company get your gold watch get a pension or not up to worry much about unemployment than uh you know being a a contractor your entire life with Fifteen thousand different drugs during your career would you do it\nYou know that's a that's an interesting um question uh first of all I guess I should thank you for thinking that I'm a millennial [laughter] actually a Gen x or [laughter]\nIn terms of baby boomers I'll specifically be speaking I'm a A R P actually in October in Houston\nA specifically on the topic of baby boomers and the gig economy because what we're finding is that a lot of boomers are coming to where they don't they don't feel secure in how much retirement they possibly have or they don't feel secure and the fact that they'll still have like they want to keep on working but they don't know how to keep on working\nAnd part of it I think about is the stigma you know when we look at what a contract worker was thought of as\nRight and in some cases still is but\nI'm seeing it less and less and less and when we think of a contract worker within an environment even a corporate environment they were really thought of as left them right like I don't know how many times I went in and it was the broken chair and um you know good luck finding an office supply and", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "year": "2018",
