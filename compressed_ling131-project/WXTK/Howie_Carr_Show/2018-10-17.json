but I I don't think that's a big deal one way or the other uses the he has a high opinion of himself\nBut I mean he's not stupid in the sense that say Maxine Waters but\nHe's you know he's well\nHe's not going on the uh he's he's not going on the men's or a board of directors anytime soon anyway aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two this is again though you know so here's the thing if if Trump would come out and said\nYou know I Can't believe that the that the Saudis or\nYou know killed killed this guy who you know used who ... who has lived at the Saudi who lived in the United who has lived in the United states and you know we're going to cut off all our relations and uh and and the blockade the uh the Persian Gulf\nAnd et cetera et cetera then they would say well he's trying

measured approach and saying you know let's let's just see a you know how this plays out and see who has see how far up the chain this goes with the Saudi Government and he is\nCow and his cousins live and what the Saudis and\nYou know the thing is\nThe same president who vowed before the king of Saudi Arabia or am I getting hip confused with an earlier\nPresident of the United states I don't believe I don't believe ah he's ever bowed to ah to the to the king or the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is this a ridiculous aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two seven seven forces some of these clouds seemed to be ready to go to war over this yeah\n[laughter] well they're also acting like if President Trump has a mean tweets about the the crown prince suddenly the journalist comes back to life\nSomething right away they\nYou ought to go back and read up on the war of ... a year\nYou know that's a that's the back and I think it was the Eighteenth century or England was spoiling to go to war with with a Spain because Spain would had had become a very weak feeble country and uh in England just wanted to rip off all the ... down in the uh down in the Caribbean so they were looking for an excuse\nSo some some idiots in Spain grabbed the British say would've named Jenkins a chopped off his ear and that was the pretext for going to war\nBut we don't we don't have a pre tax ... what's in it for us to go to war with ah with Saudi Arabia\nOr cause shoe isn't even in America again I keep coming back to this you'd think you'd think they kidnapped\nOut him Audi Murphy or

own brick and mortar stores about uh about a century ago and uh they they again\nRevolutionized the retail industry and uh\nIt's it's kinda sad to see him go down and you know the the the guy that uh the guy that run them into the ground as someone named Eddie Lambert he said he's an interesting character and I I Know a lot of people are portraying them as this really evil person but he's he's got us he's he uh\nHe he was a um he was he went to Yale with uh the guy who's now the treasury secretary new cars were they were they were classmates and he he was in a very a\nVery um a successful hedge

about Sears early I got one more story to read here at I mean we got a bunch of stories like this this is why Sears is going out of business because everybody has some some variation of this story and it's so many of us use to shop at Sears or our parents that are\nYou know we knew ... where we knew people who worked there for many years anyway this from a guy named Mike or nothing if not loyal highway\nI bought appliances from my parents in myself exclusively at Sears the last time I ordered a refrigerator they brought the wrong one three times\nThe last one they delivered correctly damage my new hardwood floors I took pictures and work with an insurance adjuster I received word I was declined the ... adjuster never even turned in his documents they told me I was declined the insurance payment because they asked the delivery men if they're damaged the floor and they said they had and\nThat was the basis for refusing to pay that was about five years ago and I never went back\nAgain that's that's way everybody's got a story like that\n\nScandal dues your and they called the ball administrators and remember the environmental police chief going on or going on a\nSuspension basically\nHundred and thirty three thousand dollars a year he says former driver he's a former state cop than they switched him over to the environmental police\nWell ... and he was suspended because he fixed the apparently fixed a parking ticket or a a you know way at a trespassing tickets something I'm a traffic citation for ... for one of his neighbors so now it turns out the two other\nTop ranking officials of the mass environmental police are also involved in this ticket\nFixing scandal at least two other high ranking Massachusetts environmental police officers helped make traffic citations involving a friend of the agencies top official disappear according to a document that outlines the details of how staffers were able to accomplish that\nAn internal agency memo a paint a through it public records request shows of behind the scenes effort by hacked police that route to avoid and round up any existing copies of to traffic citations one of which was issued to the for it to the former neighbor of colonel James McGahn\nAnd called the ball the governor didn't want to fire him because he was his driver you know there's an old saying\nNo man is a hero to his ballet\nThat goes double no man is he know Paul is a hero to his driver\nI'm sure McGahn knows a lot\nAbout Paul Deval and you know what Lyndon Johnson used to say I'd rather have him inside the tent kissing out than outside the tent piss in it so you know how bad it had to be a for for a policy of all to basically get rid of his driver\nBecause again the driver knows a lot of secrets about what's been going on for the last a number of years\nSo that's the that's the latest scandal the or so the\nThe the the whole story broke when one of the neighbors or one of the ... the ... one of the associates of the neighbor told the globe reporter that all this had gone on\nAnd now he's ... his story but it's a little late since they've already fired or basically have fired that this guy but yet and he's on lever suspension or whatever and uh\nThe citations for operating unregistered recreational vehicles and a conservation area never made their way into the state's court or vehicle registry systems unusual violation of protocol that could lead to civil and criminal penalties so guess what's happened to one of these guys that was involved in this uh Steve\nHe's retired\nStab me if you've heard this story before\nHow many state cops have retired speaking of speaking of Paul devolve police involved in scandals like sixty in the last year\nJust stay in and like for a more than forty from a
