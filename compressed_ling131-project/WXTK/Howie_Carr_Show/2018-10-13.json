{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Yeah they do you find those things on like a replacement windows ... yes they have them so that you can the window won't spread in the middle\nRight you've got to walk on the other so yeah so you know so that gentleman they\nFind them that you're able to look on line or um you know it it did find them I looked at the local um high list or as I was as I was waiting on the phone and they don't have\nSo yeah it is a specialty item like\nYeah right I think I probably got it you know years ago when he was opening a U.S [noise] you know that that's that dates like\nPainting and it sounds too I you know thinking after he hung up the phone that I run into this before where people if they install a product especially if it's a um a split GM\nThey don't shoot him behind them properly and then all of a sudden the GM starts whining light and so like the the the casing is probably holding the gym in place but there may be some\nSome room for movement if with a device like yours that would push that GM out looking\nLike a just hope that I thought of it I was as I was listening yes well I appreciate you're listening and then ... and being patient on the phones along to your input thank you Jim I Do I have a good day All right or what you're doing because it helps a lot of people will take care of your ... your like your caller but by\nThat yeah but\nAnd I will go right back to the phones again to we've got John in Norwood who's been hanging in there for a little bit of time John welcome to the handy man hauling\nHi John I'm good thanks thanks for calling us today\nI have an electrical question I decided to replace a dying old for us to like fixture my feeling yup and the basement and my house has got old wiring so it's only got two wires but of course the extra has agreed ground wire\nI Need to understand I Need to ground this bank do I need to act like 'cause the old fixture just have like a a random piece of ... running under the GOP ceiling and um you know then dropped down into the old fixture um [noise] do I need to install\nLike good junction box ups up there that has a screw on it that I give them a screw that green wire too\nBut we'll going to put that question right Jim ... is he is a man he's gotta he's got a solution for you said John So feeding the light is just to to hire um ex without a ground\nYes yep well to ground it properly you need to re feed the light with a new piece of ... with the ground and otherwise you're never going to pick up a ground somewhere the proper way [noise] um\n[noise] I don't know how do you have an idea of how it's wired to that light does it come off and on their light um give ... multiple lights together\nNo I don't think so no I think it's just so it's just that ... feed and what was it like a poll chain or is it out in the last week it has a ... okay with how far is always the wall switch in relation to the light\nMm I'd say I'm\nTaking the bank so you could shut off the power of course first but you could pull out the wall switch\nIn that plate and maybe it's being fed with a grounded Rome max but leaving it to feed the light and then on grounded romantic so you'd only have to change that one wire going from the switch to the light\nI mean I Need to have this whole house rewired I think I don't think there's any grounding anywhere\n[noise] [noise] yeah so what do you get two prong outlets everywhere in your house\nUm actually no they read the kitchen probably have a point though there's some three prom\nOkay what are you still got a couple of random to ground to to from bugs\nMost of them are still two ...\nYeah that's where you got a you've got the on grounded ... that they used years ago\nWhen I was just so much you know I don't know if that was the standard back then but now so\nYeah so the ground the light properly just going to have to come on a uh like I said pull the sweatshops and maybe it's being fed with a grounded ... but leaves it within hung grounded max and then you just change in that wire from the switch to light\nBut yourself as background that there's no safe\nOr ... yeah the ground why wouldn't be any good so you would have to re feed the switch and then we feed the light from the switch\nTo those the light doesn't doesn't require a ground to work ...\nYeah it's uh it's yeah exactly it will still work on grounded but you want the ground there to protect you\nHere because what happens is if you have an grounded light fixture and\nSomehow within that light fixture the light fixture gets activated the housing of it gets live and you go to town you're going to get shocked\nUm and that's why the ground is there to prevent any shortening how it will trip the breaker or below the fuse [noise]\nSo I mean that's something I could look at if you wanted me to um it probably take me Fifteen minutes versus you doing it a couple of hours I Would imagine right [noise] oh yeah yeah [laughter] where\nAre you located oh lord yeah I mean there are no words I don't typically\nGo up that far so if you got a local electrician that can kind of do you favor and help you out a little bit

also check us out on the Web and I am are financial dot com or our Facebook page\nSomething more crushed Boyd people check out on that yeah so we got to a posted today about you know hey a spin on it and I thought it would be good for market questions that a ... a rates have been\nKind of bumping around although not to not really in terms of the last couple of weeks right\nWell they've gone up which we always knew was going to happen to the bond obviously has been a while to change even for a month ago it's gone up um at least Fifteen basis points I think for a month ago um so that's affected rates\nAnd people were just starting to realize that I think now I think it's starting to settle in I think the market started to see that is you know I'm sure we're going to get into stock related or really happen with the equities but it seemed like a a lot of\nThe economy a lot of people are starting to think well wait a minute things are going to be more expensive now yeah cause of interest rate there was a lot\nOf focus on insurance rates and this this last week and it's certainly um I'm Brian I'm at our office said put together just something\nAnd that said treasuries started um the week after Columbus Day at three the ten year treasury ten point to two percent but it ended a Thursday a three point on four percent what's actually gone down over the last\n[noise] we do which is almost always expected to happen somewhat if the market is off people are going into driving into it because of the fear factor right yeah I've yesterday I end this go up and go down okay it ended up a little bit lower than it had\nBeen on Wednesday or Thursday so\nUm that was so there there's a there's a window\nPeople anyone out there listening now thinking about locking in a mortgage rate uh my opinion is there is a window right now before\nWe see whatever happens with this market which ... I don't know what you think whether it's going to bounce back or not but if it does bounce back then a potentially going to see rates really jumped back up again so this could be and I was like\nThat's a plausible outcome I'll tell you what this feels like ... ... and we've been talking about this little bit over the last few weeks maybe longer um [noise]\nWhen you look at 'em valuations in certain parts of the market they've been a little bit stretched I'm less so and others when you look at performance um when it comes to value stocks versus growth stocks the [noise]\nThe value stocks seem a little less stretched whereas the growth stocks have been a little overstretched\n'em and you're seeing some of that seemed to be part of what's going on in why some people want to utilities utilities popped up right right and um and the NASDAQ had a really\nGot hit got hit harder because that's more of the tech sector and and the ... names have had such a great run but they've maybe got a little over overreached in a and so when you have a market declines um\nYou know this week um we're we're down you know three or so a three or four percent depending on which index I got some stuff here but um let's see uh this in the wall Street Journal\nUm this week so markets let's see the blue shift index which is the Dow Jones industrial average and the S. and P. five hundred closed lower for the third consecutive weeks shedding for point two percent and four point one percent respectively for the week\nUm the NASDAQ more tech heavy sector a lost three point seven percent for the week\nUh and its second week of losses um stock markets around the world this week suffered their biggest shake out since February\nWith a jitters um stemming from\nSteep rise and bond yields um hire a oil prices and escalating trade tensions between us and China has ... being suggested as part of the uh the the rationale or in this article and I'd say emerging markets have for a long time been\nFeeling some of the pain that also resulted from the U.S dollar strengthening over the course of the year\nI'm a ... I maybe even longer and then uh [noise]\nI don't know there's the ... I think the big issues is you know\nPick perspective wise um this is not unusual this is not outrageous this is not a greatly distressing frankly a man it is it is a disruptive when you look at where we are here today we've given up all almost all of the games we had year to date on these major in just indexes\nBut a relative to this is kind of similar to what we saw back in January February where you know some you know sudden disruption or some people that I sat sided various causes of this um interest rates being\nOne of them what might happen in December with the fed coming back I think that was a big part of it\nYeah think expectation of how much how fast how rapidly shut this point should we continue to go forward with interest rates rising and President Trump was making his remarks about so that was one of the big factors this week I think you get a good point that\nUm he was um what was the phrase he used to to the fed has gone crazy that without [laughter] so um\nSo they don't we don't want to hear from our president and I've heard anything about really out of character\nWell you don't usually hear 'em when\nIt comes to the Federal Reserve there's usually a separation of politics from the uh the activities of the stuff that's the oldest statement he's really even made about a ... or even at\nAt all or with Jerome Powell yes you know anything you know obviously the president doesn't like the idea of rising interest rates 'cause that's a slowing effect on the economy he wants the economy to be busting out you know booming with a fabulous results\nOr last quarter for point two percent GDP which is a very robust rate of growth or one of the fed I read somewhere on the fed a a ...\nA governor is indicated that a thought it was gonna be a similar um economic expectation from this third quarter that just ended a surprised by that I thought it was going to maybe slow little ... that's impressive if he was going to be similar yeah so you know we'll see how it shakes out as an annual ... um you know for all four corners of the year\nYeah I mean I think this article um I don't ah L. dig through the particulars but it it was indicating that credit card debt was increasing um or at least I think that was part of the um earnings for these companies ... and higher rates were were factoring in um when it came to a student loans course ah there's more\nOf a student loans and these consolidation loans I run into quite a bit recently where people are um consolidating day into a consolidation loan mhm personal loan and then uh you know they're paying some hefty payments on that but they're getting\nWhat I happy to see as aggressive about paying that off or if we're able to roll it into a mortgage and really get a plan [noise]\nYeah it off and a lower rate because some of the rates are really\nWell we we've talked about this so we had a client that were referred to you or a similar kind of circumstance who is I'm just a ... a you know a cycle of things that had devolved in the you know a lot of\nUh a lot of credit card debt that man made sense just to\nUh hey let's let's a structure this differently put it into a mortgage I'm now there's a there's a consequence to when you do that you take a\nI'm a ... dead and make it a secure debt there's there's a consequence of that but and it spreads it out over many years but the cash flow was hugely different in what was getting away from\nThis particular story where the individual's like couldn't keep up\nWith a monthly now can\nNow they can in ... and that leads me to a story that that's we've been talking about our office at sleep mortgage\nA lot about recently as where clients are people call up and say\nHey here's my situation and after five minutes conversation we can give him a a remedy and something to do when many times as as the overriding comment here it is Chris they say wow I didn't know you could do that or oh I don't even know that was available\nAnd I'd really you know reached that out to anybody who's listening right now is that\nI'm really contact your professionals it's on the mortgage side give us a ring at slate mortgage\nAnd if you just got a question of like hey here's my scenario what can be done you could be freshly amazed as to what is available and what kind of options on our end and also on your end on\nNot yeah I agree but I ... I think a lot of times too people don't realize they're they're not alone you know you're ... you're not the first person who's gone through these kind of challenges\nAnd there are things that can be done sometimes that can really help materially make it a more managed whether it read it sometimes people say to us geez I you know I I have my credit isn't\nGood well we actually find out it isn't that bad air is how we can improve and how we can improve on how we can do something or\nOr maybe it will work with some of these providers that you might work\nWith with different lenders are maybe down payment I don't have much of a down payment for one even recently is jeez there's just not enough equity in my home and they think it's worth acts and it's actually worth quite a bit more and we and shown comparable worth worth\nMore [noise] so uh what were you when we come back you have a big event or that it's going to help people we'll all of these things let's mentioned that when we come back or by the way if you'd like to call in and\nWe would love to hear from you or maybe you're thinking about what's been going on in the markets maybe have a question about uh your mortgage maybe ah they're spending than the way we can be of help cyber wait seven seven one eighty nine hundred we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nThis report is ... by Walgreens roots six east bound we've picked up a crash before Quaker Meeting house road you're back a couple of miles yours is very slow getting past year but other than that we have no other problems Cape side here at all with the latest what your Cape Cod traffic I'm Brian Edwards now\nNot exactly a soap opera around here is pretty darn\nRadio Ninety five when he wakes DJ directions apply\nTerms and restrictions apply to ...\nHave changes in the law sabotage your state plan in recent years that had been an unusual number of changes in a state law\nUniformed trust coat uniform probate coat the principal and income act changed in state and federal tax laws asset protection concepts IRA stretch out\nAll of which affect the assets you leave your loved ones remember your state plan is like a parachute it must work properly the first time the attorneys that the law office of blood and boy recommend that you have your plan reviewed at least every three years\nCall five oh wait seven seven five Seventy eight hundred\nTo attend one aboard and boys free educational seminars or to set an appointment for a review at their office on route twenty eight at the high end the Centerville line\nCalled five away seven seven five Seventy eight hundred or visit their website Boyd ...

some things were just talking about I Want to mention\nUm you know we're just talking about markets and how to deal with all that stuff\nAnd setting expectations and so forth I I was listening to morning star pod cast I listen to regularly when they talk about science gosh that's where we get all the good info there's a lot of good information from them and I'm going to steal from them they had a great they had a great idea a\nThey have a a portfolio make over so we're going to offer a portfolio make over our okay so I I just thought it was a fun little concept right so if you would like to um maybe uh participate in an opportunity to evaluate your portfolio for a portfolio make of heard\nIs something you can do like in Macy's and the yeah you know the makeup counters everything yeah maybe I don't know so in any case I'm\nNot what I think we'll do as well on well first off just if it's something you'd be interested in send your name and questions you might have about what you eat a little bit about your situation\nI'm at to radio at ... am our financial dot com\nThat's radio at ... am our financial dot com\nAnd I'm just let us know you're interested in the in the portfolio makeover idea and what we'll do is I was if I I Want to check with the first make sure everyone's okay with us but I'd like to actually do it on the radio to share at least some of the details of what we can grow it would be made to give me an idea person they may not want their name\nBut I'm thinking for example will kind of look at the overall nature of their portfolio for with what's their comfort with risk we'll do our own assessment of\nWhat that looks like\nAnd then uh we'll look at what are the composition of their portfolio in different accounts and how it all fits together what the different holdings are\nGet 'em in Russia look at it and then we'll say All right here are things that are working you were things that might be a problem here I Would do it differently and here's how you know that kinda thing and and to do that we want to kind of get the whole context of what's going on in income needs\n... from the cash flow if you didn't while ago don't you need to have a re look at it yeah\nYeah so I just say that's kind of like a freebie you want a second set of eyes to look at your your investments and what you're doing and it doesn't mean you're necessarily want to turn your portfolio over for\nA new investment to feel its phrase meant live three I think part of the radio before ... can we can take a look at what you're doing and if it's great will be kissing and your praises and\nIn nice job pat on the back and if there's concerns will maybe say oh here's what you should think about doing differently give people some ideas sad and I think that you want yeah you figure other people will have things they can relate to in the course of that\nAssessments always until you get different viewpoint and they can kind of here are like oh that that's that makes sense maybe I should do that you know that kind of you just point of comparison\nAnyway so it will be fun so portfolio make over a radio a day and more financial dot com\nPerfect see it's it's what I was saying just before the break is there's many times people don't know what they don't know that was great touch with the with the make over they're going to find out new things\nThat's right

Y. advantage\nWe still have a couple of programs one is for military dogs that we sent care packages to canine of deployed and we also have a cup on new programs want us to support the caregivers of our wanted wires and then a new program that we started it's helping our veterans I'm here back at home and try to\nDecide to try to get them to get something that can help each other yeah instead of everybody else is trying to fix them which they don't need fixing they just need to to help each other through rough times\nYeah so uh so how do you how do you how do you help in that respect\nWe've got a guy that we started out supporting the Cape spent to cat who um is now a volunteer with us and we found that the best way to the best thing we can offer or not\nYou know having that means that medical knowledge now this to help our veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan is to get them together and let them help each other right yeah they whether it's sending them out fishing or if they go golfing or if they just go to dinner or whatever they want to do is just providing the financial mates for them to do that\nAnd then let them help each other through the difficult times they know what they've been through they know what they need so we brought to\nRewrite rather in the early ... better to talked to\nWere just talking with heroes and transition last week I think it was she's great yeah yeah and they were talking about some of those same kinds of ...\nOf her yeah she does a great they do it on a huge a bigger scale than we're just doing a few guys at a time but um yes indeed do they help out a lot as Harris and transition does so\nWell but you mentioned I mean have you been doing these kind of care packages and nine of the holiday season you do things to help families as well and um it's a\nIt's been something you've done for years um he said thirty thousand care packages just over the years thirty incredible thirty three thousand thirty thousand so um\nWhen it comes to those kind of things and when it comes to the seasonal things to do this time of year [noise] um how do you uh how do you do that you you solicited or\nHelp for like so it's the contents of the care packages but you also have to wrap and you have to ship and they have to pay for the shipping so big expense of his operate on how all that ... would you elaborate for the\nFor the Christmas it's hard to I I think a lot of people um we've kind of moved on and we've forgotten that we're still country at war with a country with a men and women ... to\n... thoughts and everybody's kind of forgotten about sending care packages and we still get a lottery class because they do feel like they're forgotten over in Iraq and Afghanistan and places like that\nSo we do at Christmas Time we have a big focus of sending Christmas care packages just because these men and women are way from Hong we try to send them a Christmas CARE Package includes a Christmas stocking and filled with gifts and just the normal things in the CARE Package\nSo typically we asked for people to do donation drive and the ... to get things that we need for the CARE Package whether it's toiletries her ... their coffee and things like that\nAnd then the extra things for the stockings but the big thing is of course the postage and this year I'm quite the postage went up again um [noise] and now what used to cost us about Fifteen to Eighteen dollars per care packages and now costing us twenty three to twenty five now so we took a big hit in the postage last year\nAnd are these little um members of the services that are in this area are you\nDoing now they glide from we do have a lot of men and women right now to applied but they can be from any where a lot of the request it may get either come from family members\nAnd it's mostly young family members to people\nThink about sending a care patch that ... for\nA young military family the cost to sending a care packages my ... and then the content ... CARE Package could cost you about sixty Seventy dollars for the contents\nSo for some families that's a lot to to put out a lot so they get that and we still get a lot of requests for ... for ... and they'll send us a list of\nMen and women who are not receiving any ... any CARE Package as well\nThat that's what I was going to have special because it would seem that really what's behind this is if you're sent over to the foreign land\nFight for your country and you know you're far away there is no family there's no friends there\nThese care packages really give them a sense of home and and people care striking about on behind care exactly right I I like to me that's what's in what I'm really hearing from you is that it really matters\nFor these people get and if they don't get mail\nRight yeah I mean just to be able to get something I can imagine that really makes a difference for a soldier\nDoes and it's a real morale booster yeah we get a letter is all the time saying that it really does them boost their morale just let them know that people at home still support on that we still care about him that we're still thinking about I'm sure because they do feel kind of forgotten outfit that is why it's been going on for so long\nThat we've kind of back here at home\nYou know our attention is other places\nThat we you know not the hill too much but we don't hear about it in the news a lot you know we do with all the news cycles doing all the other malarkey I call it and my dad all it but we don't really hear me to her stuff going on still in Iraq Afghanistan and in other places\nAround don't they don't they don't cover that when they're leaving you don't see any harm Cummings like no back there is no big celebrations no ...

people just turn out to help make a difference in how they\nAre so very generous it's like you said that it's hard everybody wants to do something but trying to figure out what to do or how to do it how to make it work but if you give them an ... way to support people really are January ...\nWe'll see for myself just thinking that 'cause we are going that were mentioned one fifty so okay that's thirty dollars roughly that's five\nCare packages okay so that doesn't have to vote for your job made er and er what Doug and mark or doing also and Cathy I mean just to ... ... you know we're coming into the season of giving and it's ... how many times we always heard it's really better to give\nThan receive and how much better at in these these fine Americans are reacting to the other fine Americans who are taking care of us\nYeah it is and I go it's it's\nGreat to say and it's great to hear from people like you know our acts and\nThat's that receive care packages and see that people can hear that they really it really does make a difference they may not but I mean Alex is remembered that since two thousand and ten I Can't remember anything from last year\nI found out that our ten eight years had acted that I intend to make an impact and especially as the price has gone on and on and on\nYou I just threw out an offer that uh I basically stole from ah from an idea for laid out there so that's I think I borrowed it I don't want to yeah there you know I just thought it was a great idea is a fun thing to do for the radio show we're not offer a portfolio make over\nUm so if you have um you know your portfolio your mix and you'd think I've got a pretty good mix you know or you think I haven't I don't know if I have a good mix [laughter] you know and you\nJust got away then out of a way to just say hey look at my stuff tell me what to think what would you do differently well I wanted to say on buddy do this and of course you into this I think\nCan be fun in a way to be instructive in the process to share with our listeners um hey this is a simple things that you should do these are things maybe you want to give thought to as a good idea or not or maybe for one person is somebody else might not be and here's why you know that\nKind of it's kind of play to kind of go through and I feel it's like a checkup yeah ... okay\nAnd I'm yeah I'm sure a lot of people feel pretty confident but on the other hand may not be about ideas if someone else or takes a look at it why would they say you know that kind of thing and um again this is not because you were thinking you necessarily want to you know a portfolio manager just I'd be fun for the show has a way to sort of\nSo you're going to pick up yeah all the people in and not use their real names or anything\nUnless they want to but I Would imagine probably not you know what I mean but I mean I use it as an example as a as an as a case study if you will and will's talking about it on the show and be like okay you know and if they want to join me they can if they don't want to that'd be fun to write all we can use it as an opportunity to sort of\nElaborate on here's what we found yours what they have here with the dynamics cash flow this risk portfolio that you know that kind of\nSo I got something I got to throw out here because people bringing up to the to me all the time the rate just venture to um to do that just send me an email had radio at ... am our financial dot com\nAnd just say you're interested in the portfolio make over and we'll we'll get in touch\nOkay so the Orwellian about rates will know it just in general people always ask hey what do you think rates are going to do particularly after this last week yeah we hear that so I'm really thrown back out to you sir I'm sure our listeners\nAre thinking well what's gonna happen come Monday morning equity markets yeah with the markets and I'd be curious to hear from your perspective again you know not you guessing\nWhat's yeah I mean let's face it anytime you do that it's guesswork right it is ... and who knows what in the near term from day to day to be prepared for I think look what we we've been spending time talking about is um the fundamentals of this economy remain pretty strong so we all knew when it comes to um the the outlook for the next year or so\nNothing really has changed and we still think that there's opportunity for markets to produce returns because of that broad perspective\nSo that's number one right or number two you look at valuations and there are places where the valuations have been somewhat stretched notion that yeah and so that's not unreasonable to think that this is a reaction to that and it's very possible um indexes\nWhich are very dominated by certain parts of certain names in the market is saying we've talked about a lot so you know in the news and in on the show as well but ... you know you hear you heard of this uh the different ah largely tech heavy but I'm In the ... concentration of a few names\nAnd um you know if we see Amazon or Netflix start to have some\nEarnings are slow down or anything that you know resembles what's happened with Facebook or you'd you'd expect to see it work its way into the indexes as well but because these are dominant names in in terms of our um alphabet Google you know I'm ... the Amazon you mentioned yeah like the ...\nFacebook apple apple is another right so you know so as you think about these um\n\nThink overall though you know why I think that ah today I don't I don't think is something that we expected to be like oh we've talked out and we're headed for a big change but as we look out a year or two\nUm we do think that that's a possibility in the sense that we've had our long run for a bull market longest on record we had a long period of time between recessions longer than usual\nUm and uh we are in a period of rising interest rates and not afraid of rising is on foreseen at this point\nOh really happened but the expectation is race will continue to rise and it's not uncommon for the fed to overreach and a trigger a recession that's a possibility doesn't mean it's a ... you know that a lot absolutely happen\nWhen we look at the impact of the tax um ... um [noise] what's going on there\nOr what or what has happened that the impact on earnings it had a big nice bumped in earnings this year in part because of that how would that look year over year as companies as investors look at\nThe future prospects of companies in the aftermath of that they may CEO slowing earnings and could that be a catalyst for some slow down in or market reaction I think that's possible um\nAnd how we actually going to react to the the really the big boondoggle is going to be the debt our debt that's a big issue is a bigger issue\nHas a ... both as a nation of when it comes to you know to that's what our government tattoo yeah but also we do keep seeing as we're talking about earlier consumer debt is on the rise and although interest rates have been ... rather low as interest rates continue to creep higher\nHow does that factor into the consumer's ability to continue to consume ... economy that is Seventy percent driven by consumption\nUh is likely to be impacted by that over time short gift that pays continue so\nI'm I'm a whole I think things are good investors shouldn't be overly concerned uh they should review how's they're structured what's the right mix should they be entertaining any adjustments and their portfolio design particularly as they contemplate are they comfortable with risk\nAnd what level they have of exposure and much concentration and certain types of places are holdings things like that\nAnd all of them are on to review and all the more reason why they take advantage of them make over the checkup at any time it's just like even in our mortgage business many times people say am I really in the right place\nBrio review time is great in the end of the year it's I'm disturbed me thinking of that and I will say that we do offer a complementary consultation of people do want to sit down in a more personal setting not public you know that we're offering to the portfolio make over but if you'd like a\nA conversation we're happy to have a complementary consultation to see if we can be a help and if we're a good fit

the top and bottom of the hour\nNews radio Ninety five WICK\n\nHere's the latest from ABC News I made me feel just moments ago the White House\nWe especially want to thank to administration you really fought for master\nThat's where you really see the unmitigated impact of hurricane Michael you have trees down every couple of feet so there's this forest of dead wood on the streets it goes into the yard and then you see all of the buildings the apartment buildings the houses and the businesses\nThat have trees that have toppled down on top of them\nAnd then there are other houses in businesses that have been blown apart the wind itself had such a tremendous impact on these buildings that if they didn't succumb to the tree fall they succumb to the tremendous blast of the wind itself and even when you look in the sky what you look at the skyline\nEverything as a skew the wind blew\nTelephone poles down or made them lean so far over you think they're in they're going to topple at any moment you see\nPhone poles that have been snap and then driven into the ground upside down with such force that they've actually buried themselves and that's how they stand I could go on but I guess the picture I'm trying to paint to you is so immense I Can't find the words\nSo you've covered storms before and some of them um especially Florence most recently it was really a lot of her story this however was a wind story and something that it happened so quickly I mean this storm was so big and it and it really developed quickly in the Gulf I mean I don't think so many people\nMore people probably would have evacuated had they known it was going to be as big as it was in some of the people you talk to you described\nStaying with that wind going and and then those telephone poles and trees flying everywhere it it was really incredible and and a lot of them ... if I'm right told you they would have laughed if they had known it was gonna be this bad\nYeah that's a great point a lot of the people I spoke with said that they've never experienced anything on this scale so they had nothing to compare it to they had no reason to believe it would be anything worse than Florence where at least on the south side of the storm with\nWhat was lost when people really so they didn't know of many affects until the rains came and then the flooding in this ... this was a ... this was an amazingly\nPowerful storm that came blasting through here think about how to linger the way before we were going through a lot of people that are older store money had that happen with Michael how do you stay on top of his\nHarsh this whole place would have been grumbling dust because that's how powerful that storm was\nOkay that's ... normally reports for ws be in radio in Atlanta and he's been doing a great job for us covering hurricane Michael thank you so much for having me [noise] President Trump did talk about the hurricane this week at a rally and in the oval office on Thursday\nWe will do everything in our power to cope goes in age and we will not rest or waiver until the job is done and the recovery is complete this\nWeekend White House land we had more campaign rallies resignation UN ambassador Nikki Haley a bizarre visit to the oval by Kanye West and it's only been a few days since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the newest Supreme Court justice\nSeems like a lot longer than that doesn't it here to talk about all of it is our White House correspondent Karen ... first of all let's go to President Trump talking about the hurricane 'cause it really was devastating he says he's going to go down\nTo the hurricane zone where you see that\nProbably at some point or early next week of course the big concern Sherrie is when can the president go and not impact any of the operations on the ground\nCommunications are still quite bad down there and they don't want to take away any time attention and at work power away from the people that need help so the president says he wants to get a firsthand look though at the damage we expect that when he goes down he'll get a briefing from state and local officials\nAnd do some touring of neighborhoods that were particularly hard hit it'll look a lot like the events he's done in North and South Carolina after Hurricane Florence\nAnd Texas and Florida during last year as hurricane season\nOkay you in a bathroom Nikki Haley saying that she's going to step down at the end of the year did we see that coming\nIt was a big surprise here in Washington especially here in the White House press this was something nobody was expecting and it was pretty amazing that they were able to keep this really a closely held\nThe president said he and Haley had been talking about this for some time and that the timing was right for her to say at the end of the year she was going to step down the big question of course now is what is she going to do next\nAnd she indicated this week that there is no set plan president said she could come back to the administration at any time she wants and have her pick of any job\nIt certainly sounds like she's going to take a little bit time away and not ruled out jumping back into politics but share she made it very clear I'm prompted\nNobody asked her a question but she says she's not running against President Trump in twenty twenty she will be out on the campaign trail supporting his reelection\nOkay so we're talking about campaign rallies we saw a couple of more than a week or we're going to see several more before the midterms these or something President Trump just thrives on you love them all\nThat he loved getting out on the road the White House like getting him out on the road in front of enthusiastic crowd he has for rallies this week and that's the case that's going to continue between now in the mid term elections I think he'll be on the road for five days\nNotably these are all evening events seven o'clock eastern time he wants to try and get primetime coverage\nBut there's been some reporting this week that he's actually not getting that wall to wall cable television coverage like he used to\nHe said something really interesting this week Sherry in an interview with Fox News he said people are telling him at these rallies that they wish he were on the ballot they say I Wish I could vote for you again\nAnd I just don't know if I'm going to show up on election day now maybe this is just a stick he's using to try and get people out but\nIt's certainly something that a incumbent White Houses presidents the parties are concerned about\nIn mid term election year how big a deal is Brett Kavanaugh at these are at these rallies is his name come up he the president earlier this week with bringing him up a lot as a rallying cry for Republicans and was using it to a point out the politics of the Democrats you know saying that they handled the process badly\nAnd tried to bring down a good and qualified

the official schedule but uh our colleague John Carlos asks\nThe president Thursday morning can we come in and see a little bit of your meeting and he said sure brings oppressed and\nFor the oval office photo op and Kanye West just went on a very long rambling speech\nProfanity laced he was angry banging on the resolute historic desk at one point and the president for the most part just let them talk it was very rare to see the presidency the spotlight like that he let him talk at a rate technical education and jobs and gang violence and guns and race relations\nOr even his own mental health issues and at the end of it President Trump said that was pretty impressive and then he said to reporters what do you do after that that was the question a lot of us were asking yesterday and

I'm going to revamp it and I'm going to show why it's so important that whether the market is up or down\nYour income needs to be where it needs to be it's really that simple you mark and sound thirty percent you can't and retirement say I'm going to just cut my income by thirty percent missile going to happen it's not reality so we look at all your pieces\nAnd we calico them Social Security is a is a green light check a check that's like a pension is going to be there are obviously if you're married if one of you as well one one of us passes away will lose the smaller of the two checks but while living in those two checks are what I consider a staple they're going to be there\nAnd pension checks are also I'm a nice guaranteed income stream but unfortunately a lot of us don't have that so many of us do is particularly the baby boom generation which I'm a part of\nIs we're going to rely\nOn our savings are for a one case for all three bees are IRAs our Ross all this stuff this pile of money that people say hey look I have a pile right hey I saw this commercial and my retirement readiness is pretty good because I have one point to six million at age sixty seven I mean\nThat is not really reality it makes for a great commercial and it really looks cool and a pie potshots\nBut the reality is\nHow much do you need that money too\nUh maintained your lifestyle into retirement including for ... judgments and how will the market affect the portfolio that you have in other words does your does your portfolio match your age and your risk at this particular time\nSo this is what I talk about when I go to people so we do this little program this little thing that I Do and we analyze what you have and we say okay are you in the green are you in the red now obviously everyone likes to be in the green they don't like to be in the red\nBut sometimes what they think they have and what they really have a two different things I'll give you a quick client example now so I met with this this gentleman this couple and\nHe showed me his portfolio and you know he was just typical guy had you know a decent amount of money and it was really split up among a whole bunch of stuff\nI mean I'm I'm Talking mutual funds bond funds is that the other thing and he's shown me as allocations and he said you know\nI I'm I recently made some changes you know to this company and they you know analyze where I was and I I lowered my risk from sixty stock down to forty stock wow and he goes but\nHe goes I lost money the last month he goes that doesn't make any sense and I kind of smile and he goes he's looking at me goes why smiling I go actually people confuse um you know risk\nOr oftentimes with stocks and bonds and they think stocks are more risk and bonds are less risk when the reality is it depends on the the economic conditions that drive that\nAnd I said a lot of people fall prey to that and they think because they want to back this off that you know it's going to be better for them so then I talked about the stability quotient and I said you realize that everything that you are in has no principle protection\nHe goes yeah but you know these are kind of safe and I went well did you hear what you just said you said kind of right I go what does that mean I go you just told me the last month you're down one percent on these kind of safe investments\nI go because you're not factoring in the ... the economic conditions of interest rates going up and down how they affect it and you're not factoring into fees that you're paying on these transactions and on these these accounts [noise] and I said you know you're confusing that so what if I could show you a way\nThat you could protect your principal from ever going down because of a market a downward spiral of the market a crash and yet when it goes up still participate at that level that you were before the crash seems impossible [noise] that's what he said\nYou must have met him\nBut then I showed him or how it could be done and how these products these particular types of products was by way of called index annuities and gathering you know there's been a lot of press on these\nAnd I'm a big fan of solving problems I'm not a big fan of saying one product stinks and one pot is better than the other and you should never do this or you should never do that that's ridiculous because when you do that you set boundaries you already limit your thought process you limit your opportunities okay\nI look to solve a problem I don't care what the products called\nIf I can solve my clients ... concern and by the way this disguise concern was that as he was getting older now he had and he does his words of the beautiful\nHe goes I Know the market goes up in the market goes down and goes but you know years ago I had time he goes now if the market goes down like oh wait\nI Will not have time to recover mhm or he may not have retired and I said well you may not but you're right especially when you're pulling income see when you're fifty\nAnd the market drops thirty that isn't ouch but if you're not touching the portfolio and you're adding to the portfolio you can recover over time\nBut when you're sixty seven or you're Seventy\nAnd your money drops thirty and you're taking six percent for income now you got a big problem because you need that six percent you know for income and now you have to pull from a lower pool which means how are you going to recover\nRight when you're still dipping into the asset that's a problem his income stability quotient wasn't there\nOkay he realized that the only guarantee he had in the future was his Social Security and that all these withdrawals you are taking were on shaky ground\nSo I put together a plan that said look we need to increase your income stability quotient we need to get you from forty percent to at least sixty five Seventy percent\nAnd also we did was we shifted\nGay a portion of his assets into these\nPrinciple protected index products indexed annuities that captured the S. and P. gains and even said to me boy the S P index is you know it beats most of the stuff I have without fees I go well then why wouldn't you want to use that that makes sense yeah and I and ... and I completely I look right at 'em and I said\nIf I can help you accomplish rejected by taking less risk would that makes sense for you and he goes absolutely so I showed them how to do it and he put happen and we we we looked at his income stability quotient it went up\n... income guarantees went up and his risk went down\nHe goes that's beautiful and I go oh and by the way as a byproduct I saved you about one and a half percent and fees on the money you move which was right around five hundred thousand so we saved him Seventy five hundred dollars additional year these\nWow that's in Korea and the difference is like adding another six hundred dollars of income of ... and that's it it was a simple as that it doesn't have to be complicated it's solving a problem so think about that when you're listening to me right now and you're driving in your car or you're at home and your tuning in\nAsk yourself this question if you could accomplish your objectives by taking less risk would you do it\nAnd at the very least take a look at so why don't we put out there you know I'm a copy of my book and we'll give away the first ten callers\nNow only free copy of the book will give you an opportunity to sit down and meet with me and talk about your income stability ratio and I can run in a very simple program and show

correction people who've got a retirement income plane from Steve in zoning at fairway financial didn't lose anything because of the market not at the time\nThat's because retirement income plans don't depend on the market they're designed to provide you with steady income whether the markets are going up or down and here's one more thing to know these planes are designed to provide that

those questions or concerns that you have a lotta people concerned about the market's doing so well what's coming next interest rates are changing how does affect you well these are things we talk about each and every single week on the show Steve welcome to the show and they even really busy how you doing doing\nGrace yeah here it is it's fall it's October it's a and now I Can't even sell I

different resources for you to look over at home and Steve you mentioned how you know this is how you are this is how you talk to your very down to earth you put things in simple terms\nEspecially with the you know retirement being so complicated and I want to talk about your book you wrote this book tee up your retirement at your brand new book and I'm telling you guys have you liked the way she talks on the show you're going to love this\nBook very very easy to understand right\nYeah and I purposely did that you know I I've read many books over the years of course on retirement planning and you know\nMind isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination but what I like about it is I broke it down and try to give real life examples like will do on the show again today of people who are in different stages in situations on their lives and how I was able to work with them and\nYou know not solve all their problems but certainly gives them a track to run on I mean I consider myself a quarterback right and so\nWith the years of experience I've had and seeing the ups and downs in the markets in the economy and everything that goes on\nAnd me you know starting when I was single then married kids' college mortgages right I I've kinda\nBeen through all of it so I think it helped me gain some perspective so when people are sitting in my office and they've got\nFour one K. here and an IRA here and and you know they're trying to figure out do I have enough money you know I'm not going to run out of money you know what happens if I get sick and all the questions that come up this is a legitimate conversation this is what we talked about in my office and the shots in the grass and all that stuff\nHonestly you could throw most of that out the window because real life you know and I get that from my John Hancock days right real life real answers I loved that campaign that John Hancock did and it it it hit home for a lot of people that's exactly what this is about it's about sitting down and saying are you ready\nTo retire if not what's the alternative plan do we work a little bit longer do we work part time if you're already retired\nWhere are you at are you ... are you comfortable are you going to have to go back to work how's your portfolio holding out obviously the last ten years it's been fantastic right when\nYou know people who've been around we know that that's not reality and that sometimes you gotta have set back so that's why part of the show today we're actually going to talk about that right that the income stability and we've got to talk about how you can measure that\nTo see where you're at you know are you are you on target not just for the last few years but what happens if someone throws a a wrench at ya how was your income going to hold up to that racial or that's a big piece\nYeah I mean you you definitely need income plan you need to have a plan in writing and he talked about all of course right here the income stability ratio so that means basically how do I accomplish what I Want to do and by taking less risk cow is that possible Steve what's the solution there\nWell first of all I think that if it if you can accomplish your objectives by taking less risk why wouldn't you do that right and I think the answer and I've asked this question a lot recently and\nPeople have said well yeah sure that we buy could do that but that's not reality and I said well actually it is reality and I've been doing it for over twenty something years but these particular vehicles but\nEssentially the\nThe risk the income stability ratio is just a measure of how your income will hold up in good times and bad times and we have a really interesting shot and it's on my my site I gotta I actually I got to put up this week\nA called a tale of two brothers billing Steve and we talk about this and the show a lot but it's really holds home and I'm going to revamp it and I'm going to show why it's so important that whether the market is up or down\nYour income needs to be where it needs to be it's really that simple you mark and self thirty percent you can't and retirement say I'm going to just cut my income by thirty percent missile going to happen it's not reality so we look at all your pieces\nAnd we color code them Social Security is a is a green light check a check that's like a pension it's going to be there are obviously if you're married if one of you as well one one of us passes away he will lose the smaller of the two checks but while living in those two checks are what I consider a staple they've got to be there\nAnd pension checks are also I'm a nice guaranteed income stream but unfortunately a lot of us don't have that so many of us do is particularly the baby boom generation which I'm a part of is we're going to rely\nOn our savings I for one case for all three bees are IRA saw Ross all this stuff this pile of money that people say hey look I have a pile right hey I saw this commercial and my retirement readiness is pretty good because I have one point to six million at age sixty seven I mean\nThat is not really reality it makes for a great commercial and it really looks cool and a pine potshots\nBut the reality is\nHow much do you need that money to uh maintain your lifestyle into retirement including for ... judgments and how will the market affect the portfolio that you have in other words your does your portfolio match your age and your risk at this particular time\nSo this is what I talk about when I go to people so we do this little program this little thing that I Do and we analyze what you have and we say okay how are you in the green or you are in the red now obviously everyone likes to be in the green they don't like to be in the red\nBut sometimes what they think they have and what they really have a two different things I'll give you a quick collide example and so I met with this this gentleman this couple and\nHe showed me his portfolio and you know he was typical guy had you know a decent amount of money and it was really split up among a whole bunch of stuff\nI mean I'm I'm Talking mutual funds bond funds is that the other thing and he's shown me as allocations and he said you know\nI I'm I recently made some changes you know to this company and they you know analyze where it was and I I lowered my risk from sixty stock down to forty stock wow and he goes but\nHe goes I lost money to last month\nHe goes that doesn't make any sense and I kind of smile and he goes he's looking at because while he's smiling I go actually people confuse um you know risk\nOftentimes with stocks and bonds and they think stocks are more risk and Bond's a less risk when the reality is it depends on the the economic conditions that drives that\nAnd I said a lot of people fall prey to that and they think because they want to back this off that you know it's going to be better for them so then I talked about is stability quotient and I said you realize that everything that you are in has no principle protection\nHe goes yeah but you know these are kind of safe and I went well did you hear what you just said you said kind of right I go what does that mean I go you just told me in the last month you're down one percent on these kind of safe investments", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "13"}
