I think to use that word they're using it against him that he can't he can't go out and be part of the public debate or have an opinion or talk to the president because he struggled it's still instead

people were making about Kanye West\nAnd act like John Lennon so hysterical laughing that oh look at his face look in his face like oh look at the white guy space you can't believe we're talking like

and he's going to have somebody who can stand with an effect but [noise] [laughter]\nIs look at us God\nBless and black folks are about to pray Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with

people kit disowned their own\nEverything everything Kanye West the saying is confirmed by his critics\nYeah I I really think that is the biggest point they may have had a little bit of a chance of getting him back had they not completely insulted him and and and insulted his intelligence and his mental state it's who\nYou know\nLike if I had an opinion and you guys just ridiculed me for it I'd be like well what's wrong with you people are feeling for being this there are so scared they're so incredibly scared of a different opinion of someone shaking up the norm and they're proving it because every time he opens his mouth\nThey're only way to counteract it to say oh it's so sad he's really disturbed which by the way it is an interesting tactic and I'm going to take it up next time when I debate someone about politics the second I disagree with them rather than bring up any points of view that I'm just gonna go oh you must have\nMeant I told them I Try to learn from watching Democrats just like last week with a Elizabeth Warren when she got busted by us for you know writing off the fifty thousand dollars worth of used clothes and then it's right there on a tax returns and she says oh\nI wasn't in here right right so I mean whatever whatever they do they've they they've got an excuse and you're supposed to buy it\nRight my favorite part though of the term caught you're meeting was one of the reporters at something like are you going to get a picture with Trump and some kind of hesitated and was like I don't want to put you in that position like right photo up\nAnd ... he said something like I'm standing in that position I'm coming over there right now I Want to give you a hug I Love this man everyone in the room\nWas like one and then as he's leaving he's hugging the reporter he talking like Jonathan Karl all these guys and it's true one of his things that he says and I'm not saying he constantly sounds like perfectly you know\nHe points to always come across perfectly which neither do mine but one of the things he always says his lead with love and I think that actually is very powerful because they want to hate him and every time they hate on him\nHe doesn't get him angry he comes back and says things like I understand where you're coming from I get that\nBut when you have your you have your rights to freedom of speech just like I Do right so why are you trying to take away mine 'cause I'm not trying to take away your it's\nVery very disarming for people if it's a it's like the old expression you get more bees the tiny if you're nicer to people it's harder for them to ridicule you and that's why I think it's so easy for ... rowing alley now she who you guys heard in the opening because they don't know ... and they're not going to say that too if they\nDon't know I I understand why Trump was giving him the option of having his picture taken with them because sometimes especially in these days of social media pictures can come back to haunt you as Steven I proved today with the governor of Massachusetts of the uh now with David Mayer Boyd mayor Fall River\nDo much for my road Russian [noise] [noise] oh\nWe want to Casper

S. the by the way the Bridgeport Democrat mayor that I was trying to remember the name of Joe Ghana set the prison\nThan reelected just lost to a moon bad Ned Lamont in the gubernatorial primary aid for four five hundred forty to forty to John your next with highway car go ahead John\nHey good afternoon alley or back from a back on the economy just to saying sure a\nTruck Trump's instinct on this I've I've been doing this for a long time I've been in the business for Thirty years now Trump's instinct on this call you at the fed is correct for this reason\nEven though rates are relatively low the amount of debt and the system isn't wasn't absolved in in two thousand eight it was just moved around the government took a lot on it and the second point is you know same thing the feds run by a bunch academics Powell is a good guy\nBut I don't think the feds missed all free at last financial crisis and since the debt as has gone up a lot globally small changes that race can have huge impacts on the economy in the stock market and so I think Trump's instinct on this is dead right\nWell I mean so you're saying it's a ah it's it's a set up or they just ... play in their hand\nI I don't think it's a set there there there are a couple of members of the fat I Am trying to think there is a woman on there as blonde hair that used to work for Hillary she's a real moon bat and she she was giving money even though she wasn't allowed to speak it probably look it up Leslie or something other [noise] no I think\nI think they don't really they rely on these academic models to model the economy\nAnd they got it wrong and two thousand with the Internet bubble they got it wrong in two thousand eight they were Peter Lee warned about the mortgage crisis year after year at\nRight here yeah I mean and senator senator and they're going to get on out senator so new to warn them about that and the Democrats said it was racist to try to walk crack down on the\nOn the uh the the high risk loans that were being made to to homeowners and uh yeah I mean that was that seems like that was a totally preventable crash in two thousand eight wasn't it\nIt it was they were ... or ... I mean Iran mortgage money for years and we saw in two thousand three what was going on ... you know and I was a city at the time we uh we learned our management to it but\nWhen you're given a free money out of this with the Democrats are good at nobody wants to hear the consequences of the free money\nSo yeah that was preventable But Trump's instinct telling you what he's dead right on this call him out because people say to me well race really three percent there were five or six percent during the you know you know six or seven before the crash then\nIt's not the rate it's the total ... debt in the system so even though rates are lower the interest ... it's just math ... turbines math and so uh I'm not saying there's going to be an immediate crash but the academics that run the fat and they're all academics\nThey really don't get it and uh and so I think Trump is Trump's instinct on this he doesn't just come up with this for a political ploy you know I think that right on this and I tell you that\nYou know this is one of the things that Democrats are are still really a angry about the fact that the Obama just cratered the economy so bad and there was eight years of malaise and then as soon as Trump got in uh the economy started coming back\nAnd and you know remember the a rubber the fake headlines of fake headline it was a front a fake front page of the globe ran Trump or the the ... this nightmare scenario if Trump was elected in one of the big a big parts of their fake news front page that they put out in the spring of twenty six theme was\nA Trump elected markets crash and so of course the markets\nAnd been an all time high and it really bugs up and that's why you see that's one of the things they're ah ah one of their recurring themes that that's that that somehow this is Obama's economy\nThe fact that you know the unemployment rates are at historic lows among the most the demographic groups\nThe fact that uh there are more people working today in the United states than at any time in history of the country\nAnd it just really really bugs of and that's why they keep saying it's Obama set in motion and he's not getting the credit he deserves\nSo is now so if if Obama last week there were complaining about Obama wasn't getting the credit for that he deserved and so I guess this means that\nThings couldn't have changed that much in a week so he must be responsible for the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average has lost fourteen hundred points almost in the last two days right\nRight no that's not right oh okay okay I got it\nNow if if something good happens it's Obama's fault if something bad happens uh it's it's to Obama's credit I should say something bad happens it must be a Trump's fault so this is this is the Trump crash\nI can see that I can see that the postings on the newspaper and a Facebook message boards now\nI I think the correct terminology is Trump's slump\nFrom are you happy now Trump

I haven't seen any ads like this have you seen any on TV\nThat are residing there have been a few\nUh I have to say and in full disclosure that I don't watch a lot of a lot of Massachusetts telling\nNor do I [laughter] but I I think that I see I see a few ads every once in a while and there are there a referendum campaigns that are going on right now in the in the commonwealth\nEspecially a question one which is this involves nurses but I haven't noticed this so far is this is this a real is this going to be a real problem or can can you get around it by just by just you know having a not mentioning candidates may\nWell you can do that uh you know ... and I think that's that's getting a sort of hard to what the problem is you know the ads that that my client wants to run you know they're not they're not trying to get anyone elected what they want to do is encourage people to to look at any issue policy in this case you know tax sites and uh\nYou know the what the legislature society to pay itself and you know to to encourage engagement between us citizens and their legislators in fact they want to run this in a district in Massachusetts where the senator who's being named doesn't even have an opponent in the election\nSo it it it's it's factually untrue to say at least that the ads are actually connected in any way to electoral activity this is just standard discussion of political issues\nSo we'll we'll is a Willis prohibition against the against running a basically adds without a disclaimer well this also apply to unions are just a or just to to a private entities\nI Believe it to a belief that applies to anyone who isn't a party or a political committee or you know one of these entities that does exist to to affect the outcomes of elections\nSo that yes or no for unions are unions the fact that\nI Believe they are often said\nOkay I 'cause I'm just wondering you know 'cause sometimes I you know the or the left tries to a a ... unions from the same uh the same laws that they would apply to corporations as you as you well know", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "11"}
