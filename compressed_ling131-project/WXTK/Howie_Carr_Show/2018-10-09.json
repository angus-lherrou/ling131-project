ambassador Nikki Haley\nBecause Trump has been winning so much whether it's with Kavanaugh Gorsuch or a you know the uh the the uh read may the re casting of of NAFTA as a as a better trade deals for the U.S or the or the the record high\nEmployment rates a number of Americans employed the record low unemployment rates among women blacks Hispanics et cetera everybody basically highest unemployment rate uh in terms of percentage of since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nThey have to always look for the uh the the bronze the lead lining in the silver cloud\nAnd so now today you've seen this Nikki Haley the former governor of South Carolina as as a she was the UN ambassador was doing a great job she decided to resigned today so there is so they're they're they're working overtime trying to come up with ah with\nWith lead linings for this\nWell can we started with my conspiracy theory what's that my conspiracy theory\nIs that he fires Jeff Sessions is a G A point Lindsey Graham is the new attorney general uh than the governor of South Carolina McMaster appoints Nikki Haley to be a senator where she waits in kind of like the underdog league until it's time for her to run the Senate and twenty twenty four\nOr ... or has been sorry for president maybe maybe she's a vice president for my pets\nYeah but I see I don't think Lindsey Graham wants to be in the cabinet oh I don't either he said as much yeah so I I think I said why were thrown out crazy conspiracy theories that mind right well the ... the craziest one I heard was that she was going to run against\nTrump in twenty twenty ... wait a second she's got she's got to cut up the big anti Trump voted the Republican primaries with Jeff Flake who is probably not going to run now ... and John ... is that why is that the thing yes grace\nI think she's going to be VP and twenty twenty four for ...\nFor Kanye West see this is not to see this is a whole nother theory is that you know Kanye West is going to have lunch at the White House on Thursday so they that this ... this theory I mean this is now we're just in to like\nYou know I thought the marijuana shops weren't open I thought it was going to be another couple of weeks before they started selling it out on the ... out on the street corner\nA base has it been burned and went back here\nNo I'm Talking about the Kanye West theory which is he's a Trump is invited Kanye West of the White House to offer him the ambassador ship to the un\nNow they I mean you know what I I don't know about you personally if if I was offered the ambassador ship to the un I'd say this is a gag\nRight press [laughter] I mean who the hell wants to be the ambassador to the United nations\nMan you tennis fans know could read back you mean I'm not saying that I'm hearing man I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on by the way many at all you cheated signing\nA bit of trouble back to your well I think the the thing that was crazy to me was all of the never Trump or is in the in the moon bats trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the ... or she didn't like the confirmation hearings or\nShe disagrees with the trade policy or there's something that she disagrees with\nWhen according to reports they've been talking about this for months now and it's just now becoming out\nRight I I Know it's a ... yeah this is I mean\nAnd again they're they're just fantasizing I mean it is a little odd though then it comes before midterms what'd you typically expect something like ... like this to be announced after midterms livelihood unless there's some other you know act in the play\nWhat it's like a it's like Rosenstein wasn't fired yesterday you know because the midterms are coming up and they don't want any distractions uh uh\nYou know although you know there are all these rumors going around that there's big announcements coming down with the president's supposed to have an announcement tonight right some kind of big announcement\nI Hope it's a I Hope you are talking about releasing the uh the unwritten pact that are ... applications and everything else I mean I Know I'm obsessed with this thing but\nYeah so it's some of the VIPs are here to there they're hoping for that as well I just I Want to get this stuff out I I'm just I'm just still appalled by this whole thing and you know a lot of people are so there's one that's another conspiracy theory that's going around is that uh\nIs the Trump\nTook Rosenstein her or excuse me his new name as redacted Stein\nA took a deputy attorney general rod redacted Stein down through Orlando with them so that he could like you know just have him in one place on the air force one and just tell them look you know I I could blow all you guys up\nYou know all I have to do is sign one quarter ... uh you know releasing all these forms and you're all I don't know if you're going to prison but you're all going to be totally humiliated totally disgraced even even in the uh it in the ... left media they'll they they have to be shocked by these multiple violations of by every bodies civil rights\nAnd so I'm going to just uh I Am going to keep you guys at arm's length and I got this hanging over your head and I'm not going to do anything right now now I have been a ... here here's my conspiracy theory\nOh boy he took him on the air force one because as he was concerned after the election the Trump Tower was bugged or not but but surveilled because in fact it was\nI think how about this he he brought Rosenstein on the air force one because he knew air force one was an odd\nOr surveilled the skiff yeah yeah and also it also was Rosen was were back then Stein was he ... he was he was he frisked before he went on I mean again\nI mean Trump does want to bring stop and frisk back to Chicago so why not bring it back to air force one\nI think he needed war there I think you need more with dealing with redacted Stein than you do a you know in the loop you know I mean he ... he's on the record we have the fact that he said he claims that was a joke but he's never denied that he that he said to some of the other rock corrupt or hacks\nIn the FBI the D. OJ that he would be willing to wear a wire against the president of the United states\nIsn't that isn't that something this guy is the deputy attorney general and you still have to keep him around after ... we really are in uncharted waters here as far as the United states of America goes I mean right now\nYou know were riding the tiger and it's it's it's working out for us but this is dangerous you know when you when you have slime like redacted Stein and everybody in the mainstream media and every elder dams on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThis is a really really something to meanwhile is a is a six one seven points out a CNN has run another story on the presidential uh Jetta Talia today they so they're backed the Stormy Daniels does this mean that the Michael ... is going to be rehabilitated\nOr they this desperate that they have to bring by Michael ... you know they've spent the last forty eight hours blaming him for the fact that they weren't able to succeed in uh in burning Brett Kavanaugh at the stake\nTo be fair I think like lava that he could get better ratings and Don Lemon [laughter] not saying\nMuch yeah I mean none of them I I mean they're all they're all terrible though there are terrible as someone says give Elizabeth Warren the ambassador shipped to the un I who who wouldn't want to I mean I guess I guess some people have made something of it that wasn't Daniel Patrick Moynihan the ambassador to the un I mean he made something out of an elected to the Senate\nIt is technically a cabinet level position yeah the key word is technically you know it's [noise] I just uh I mean if there's no ... ag secretary but it's in there yeah\nI I don't know a a five oh wait I Want Trump to kick Pence off the ticket run Haley has BP at twenty twenty\nNow you never get a ... to get kicked off the ticket as BP you've you've got to be some not like Henry Wallace at forty four where you have to be on the verge of indictment like LBJ and sixty three and that's you know that's\nThere's a good chance he was gonna be thrown off the off the ticket at sixty four but something else happened\nA four four or five hundred forty to forty two so these these are
