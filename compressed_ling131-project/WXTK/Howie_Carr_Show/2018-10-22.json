grow organizers say there are no seven thousand people in the group and we did not governments traveling with them\nAnd a President Trump has already said that a he's a alerted the border patrol these alerted the U.S military this is an emergency but the question here is we're going to have and culture with us at four thirty and it is for the bottom of the hour I should say depending on where you are\nAnd we'll ask her about it but we're going to take a lot of your calls and the next few minutes about this what should be done and they've got to stop these people from coming into the country I mean the you know this is this is an invading force and again under a article one section eight of the U.S constitution in the event of a a rebellion\nOr an invasion the president of the United states has the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus which is basically uh you don't have to observe due process if you're being made but this is an invasion I don't know how to describe this I guess you know they would make the argument that these are just a poor migrants fleeing violence and poverty\nYou know the problem is they're bringing in violence and poverty to the United states a disproportionate amount of the violence and poverty in the country has been brought to us by illegal immigrants\nThey how do you want the Spanish translation for ...\n... ... do my golden ball much Charles Bolden ball's moving el north\nDe ... that's what they are the back of bonds and you look at them and they they ... only God will stop us\nYou know I mean God has got a it was God's gonna get God's going to give them directions to the welfare office now they're going to be some bearded lawyers and\nBirkenstock once they get across the board of that's going to give them some directions to the welfare office\nAnd you know who's paying for this we keep coming back to this the same\nCan can you know question who who is going to pay for this aid for four or five hundred forty to forty to someone says\nThere's at least one guy in the army that was wearing an American flag sleeveless shirts got to let him and he's one one hundredth one one thousand twenty\nFourth redneck one there's one American flag and the whole mob they're mostly they're they're waving hunter and flags ... since windows ... fleeing refugees where the wave the flag of the country they're fleeing from if the if the country is so terrible well why are they a ... taking the flags with them\nI saw a picture of some of the Hondurans painting a swastika on an American flag and setting it on fire\nReally oh they're so then they they really do want to assimilate into the country well it's so awful\nApparently they're just coming here to make it a better place maybe they want to come punch Nazis with antifa\nI thought I thought if you carry your own flag wouldn't that make you went to a foreign army I mean this is I mean again I I think this passes the uh\nPasses the constitutional past of being an invasion\nAnd uh I I don't think there's any need to uh you know just take the ... just round them up and take them back to where they came from\nI don't I don't care I just I don't want to come into the country and by the way if you're seeking asylum isn't aren't the international law that you seek asylum in the first country that you've fleet to for instance you know when the Syrian civil war was at its height\nThose those people were fleeing to turkey which was next door or to Jordan which was next door\nThey weren't they weren't going to Afghanistan to to what to escape the violence you get it you just get out of the country where the the violence is so they've Honduras they have to Honduras is south of Guatemala so they went through Honduras Guatemala now they're in may he co and they're making their way to the U.S\nWhy are they making where to the U.S 'cause this is a welfare state obviously\nAnd the other thing is with Syria that it was a systematic violence committed by a state actor these people are fleeing\nLocal crime yeah or they claim they're local clock crime you know they're fleeing war is what they're fleeing how many of these people are going to work how how many of these people do we have to go back and\nGet the Obama era statistics about how many illegal aliens from Central America end up on welfare it's like Seventy eighty Ninety percent\nSo what is the what is the upside to the U.S taxpayer you know this is an invasion they these are paid he I I I think they're being\nPaid so does it the the the goal here is to is to get millions upon millions more of these people into the country and let's just try and they want to turn this country into\nInto Venezuela they want to overwhelm the native born population of whatever stripe you know whatever and race ethnicity whatever you\nKnow and this kid this can't be good news for the Democrats it just can't I mean if you're like a second third generation Hispanic in uh in LA or Texas Nevada\nAre you

wanted the wall for a reason and we've been seeing it every three months since he's been president\n... uh what would you do I mean you know I I I found something today a reference on power line block

really popular issue that you know your opponents will take the unpopular side on\nBuilding the wall they should be making the Democrats vote on Wall funding uh every week since since the Republicans have been in the majority let them take that back to the voters nope nope I decided of old doesn't work on people are getting a little tired of that argument\nI think Democrats are pretty fortunate once again that they have the media and they're back pocket cause a a real a free press would be asking the Democrats well isn't this a you know are reaping the whirlwind now I mean this is what you've always wanted to hear it is coming right your way and time for the midterms\nBut they're not you know Democrats are getting a pass on this pretty much\nKnow the president is very bad but the principal advantage the Democratic party has is the Republican Party\nWhy on earth would you not have your opponents vote on something you know this is massively wildly popular and utterly implausible reality TV star was just elected president of the United states on the slogan build the wall we know the voters really really want this and we know\nThe Democrats are going to vote against it\nShould we keep bringing up bills to make them vote against it and I don't know let's push tax cuts and move the embassy um no they're they're just beyond redemption we thought watching the campaign that

... he he says he's going to do I don't think he's got to be choice now that you know I mean he's he he let this thing you're right he let it get away from him but now he's got\nTo do something I mean the end and again if he if he does something is going to be like the Cuban missile crisis I think you know when a JFK ah\n... you know ... defy expectations and the ... the Democrats did better because I mean this is this I mean this is a more serious matter ... when you think about it than the missile crisis I mean that was kind of an over rated emergency when you look back on it but\nThis

she had never said that you want it to ah to to abolish ice and we we had the ... in the intro her lie and then the the actual statement that she made last summer what play that in a little while\nBut she also said something about this specifically the or the Boston office the or the the ice agents working in Massachusetts and again\nThey uh they they have a terrible uh\nBurden to bear and not just rounding up these illegal alien criminals yeah but they're they're often times are stopped\nBy court personnel they go to court to pick somebody up who's been arrested\nEdited and at least one or two at least one or two cases that have been documented by ice they've been they've been stopped for picking them up like ... percent while the illegal alien a drug dealer or domestic abuse or escapes off the back door the court house it's\nOn imaginable even five or ten years ago but this is any way this is what the ... first I should introduce a pod lions he is the acting field office director\nUh enforcement and removals operation for the Boston office of ice immigration and Customs Enforcement or Todd lions thanks for being with us here on the highway car show\nOh thanks get asked me to head back I prefer Willis I'm going to play this I'm going to play this cut and then I Want to get your response to what this is from the debate I watched I watched both days this from the friday\nOr the Sunday debate the first one this this ... this is the friday night debate in a in a bright go ahead and\nI was here in Massachusetts go after people show up to testify in a trial when they threaten people that they want to report crimes when women are strained tour important to mask the ... because they're afraid someone in their family or one of their neighbors will be picked up by ice [laughter]\nMake anybody any thoughts about we need to make safer but that is consistent with our family\nIs there any truth to what she said ...\n[noise] well I I ... in the year that I didn't hear the senior manager categorically tell you that we don't go and arrest people at court houses that are testifying crime number one if we're if we're at the courthouse which we do daily we make arrests all over the state\nOr individuals that are carrying a court that of criminals it they're they're just so that you're there for criminals um yeah they call it that really struck me the hard it is that the voice she said about when the ... report domestic pilots\nI Would tell a senator or anyone who had asked us it's completely the opposite\nWith the state and the London speaking with us not being able to arrest people in a local agency nothing in order to cares we hear from more victims as to why I Can't remember who the person or why they were released that I think they're more afraid\nOf the fact that not that they're illegal the fact that we can't do our job because they get right release right back to the community but we had a chance to get rid of them but those same offenders go back and repeat the cycle of violence when it comes to domestic violence\nI should explain the lung decision for the state or listeners and viewers of the lung decision was by the highest court in Massachusetts Supreme judicial court\nSaid that a lot local law enforcement couldn't a honor and ice that pain or if they had a criminal law and it was involving this uh illegal alien Cambodian drug addict named Lon\nWho was ... free and then a couple of weeks later he was a re arrested\nAnd charged with beating an elderly woman in a wheelchair and stealing twenty five hundred dollars from her in order to buy more drugs and that I mean that's when you're that's a\nLarge degree when your problem started right I mean that that you would like to tell people about what happened when you guys went to was the ... the courthouse just west of Boston\nThought we had an incident back um it was just a couple of years ago when the individual that what was the newer driver that had raped a beat the student wants to ... although\nI'll tell you about the college student and she was doing the responsible thing was taken over um and then\nShe's raised by over driver goes from the Dominican Republic and instead of being turned over to us so he ... he would stand trial he would face those crowds he was released out of the court and we started to get any subsequently went back to\nThe Dominican Republic\nAnd do you ask them to hold it and then there was the case in Quincy and an African who are raped a woman ... and you guys went to pick him up correct\nCorrect you went to um pick them up as well or he was from Donna and he was released um there was a case here or the ... just wasn't on it or is this place and that subject board a flight back to God or the next day\nAnd everybody was pointing the finger at each other the clerk or the judge and the sheriff and everybody was trying to blame each other\nTheir private for him getting loose so what does it does so so what you're saying is that since this a lung decision by the Supreme judicial court you've had more women calling and say why why didn't you pick up this guy who attacked me he's back out on the street now when I'm ah I'm petrified album so in other words is is that what you're is is that what you're saying\nHas always the answer is paying patio\nThe reason it's patio knows Cape Cod sixth generation family business

[noise]\nThis is your brain on ... that's the lesson about one [noise] [noise]\nLove them Matthews brothers [noise]\nEight four for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number about how we car show up to like to join us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon as you know a a\n... a vague rent mob is winding its way through Mexico headed for the U.S border and the\nPresident Donald Trump has said he's going to stop them today he uh I guess I don't know if he said the ... before he got on the plane to Houston\nOr a ... to ... he challenged the ah the media to take the cameras inside the caravan and see if they can find some gang bangers some MS Thirteen members or some middle Easterners because again we know we know a lot of MS Thirteen gang bangers got in through the last a surge\nOf unaccompanied children the Texas a public safety department has a has documented\nAnd we know that a lot of um mid eastern for potential terrorists have been arrested recently in Guatemala was in the major newspaper down there the president of the country announced it\nSo joining us now on the line is Jessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies a and we just wanted to ask her\nJessica what the what should the president do next how can how can we stop this a mob but this this mob particularly before the midterms in ... and all these future mobs from a breaking into the country and invading it and trying to fundamentally transform it is a\nBrock Obama cheered them on what city do\nWell there are a number of things he could do he'd been leaning on these other governments to enforce their own immigration laws that should help but yeah we can't wait for other countries to ah yeah save us from caravan so we have to take steps in cases like this one of the options he has it just simply\nClose the border it's an extreme\nOption diet you know if I Am a mob of four thousand people edge hell bent on\nTesting our sovereignty that's what we're gonna have to do and it can be done and then you know short hurts business for some people but it hurts our communities and the rest of the country where these people are struggling not to stop them so that's one option the other thing is is it in and started that would be simply\nTelling these people know you don't get to apply for asylum here because you come right through a thousand dollars\nPer thousand miles here is a country that has offered us island\nSo you have no basis for making that claim here\nOn the other thing is that we simply I you know just but I really I hold the line with the help of military an additional border patrol agents her mother\nHow 'bout how 'bout I've been suggested this all day I read it on power line blog dot com\nWhy don't the under the U.S constitution the president has the power in the case of a rebellion or an invasion to was suspended habeas corpus I due process I mean ... and just declare basically a state of national emergency because of an invasion I mean this is an invasion is it not\nWell it sure feels like wind when you have people waving the Honduran flag and trampling the barricade I you know between Guatemala and Mexico\nAnd looting ... economy looting grocery stores\nOn their way north I mean these are not people who were planning to contribute anything to the U.S economy obviously they're criminals\nI well many of them are and certainly entering illegally would be a crime yet and the president\nHave the authority under the constitution Claire that any\nAliens that he feels a would be a threat to the United states from anywhere can be barred entry just like with the travel ban it's the same um statutory basis as the travel ban which of course has now been held up\nIn court approved by the Supreme Court\nDoes that to an authority he has and that would be the basis for simply shutting down the places where these people will try to enter a and the president also has the authority in crisis two deputy by state and local law enforcement agencies and I have a feeling that Texas at least would be quite happy to\nUm help with its resources because they've been doing it for years now already at their own expense\nGot into a big touches you don't ... I think Texas has been moving the national guard down I heard the lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick on another show earlier today saying that they were moving troops into position but I I mean I don't think that they have the same powers that are that are the regular army or the border patrol what have you know\nThat's right only the border patrol can make immigration arrests but we don't actually want to make any arrests\nThat we want to keep them out Andrew Humphrey we don't we don't want them to that's the thing about suspending hey be as corpus I mean that way you can keep the uh these these gang of immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from a ... you know ... you're the one of the ... says the or the process isn't all the appeals process isn't over until the alien wins and it's so true I mean we got to keep them on the line we gotta keep 'em on the other side of a border\nYou know to prevent them from getting inside 'cause once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nFor the rest of their lives in ours no question about it once once people get and it's game over I'm just and the problem is is this is what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got in\nAnd I'm surprised it took so long for another one to form um so that's why we need really from and forceful measures now and we can explain it to the New York times later\nWhy don't you tell us I how many what percentage of illegal aliens from Central America up on welfare\nAccording to the bottom and I noticed Rosen's own statistics which I've seen Breitbart", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "22"}
