picks up the slack so we said they raped by so ... so he's accused the uh the the officials are raping the UMass Minutemen so Steve what's the question what are the\nResult stuff's park do you agree with the decision to suspend UMass football coach mark Whipple because he used the word rape there was a really stupid word to use that are really I mean I I Know that you leave your PC on this one\nWell I I hate when people use the word except for an actual mean\nIt's well I mean there there is there ... there is an archaic meaning if you look up the dictionary arcade meaning old fashioned like rape and pillage rape and pillage rape up the say binds that means carrying off the sea by women but it's but the the the meaning now is sexually violated and\nHe didn't say they sexually violated us he said they raped us\nYeah I I Know I Know we ended up and that the I just I just don't know why you're you're not one hundred percent on his side I mean ... can be avoided a headache if you just used a different word OK but to suspend him and take money from him for this\nWell he he is a pretty rotten coach well yeah okay so what was it struck hiring was he not forty environment you sucks I'm just I I well I'm not saying I don't think he should be suspended for the one\nGame but I'm just saying it was a really stupid word to use imprecise\nYou guys can have different answers to the question how what is your answer\nMy question is no it should not be suspended and see if no okay so what's the what's the Ninety two percent say no\n\nBut again I mean it was you got a really ... you you begin to wonder less about why the theme is fourteen forty cents he came back when you when he would say something that's stupid\nI Know it's like a situation with like a a certain sending in

can just avoid a headache\nI understand that a nice because someone who's put that word on the front page of the Boston Herald\nBut I don't really feel I mean I guess I kind of feel bad but I mean he shouldn't be surprised that there's repercussions from using that word in the current climate that we have people get in trouble for a lot less people are in trouble for saying monkey up a situation so I mean knowing that was that was even more ridiculous yeah but I'm just saying knowing that\nIf your job is to coach you would think you'd go to bill ... and be very very careful and you\nKnow if he said we got screwed nobody would be nobody would be talking about this and by by the way the the the UMass or sports information office apparently they they they cut out the whole sentence because they knew he was going to get at the trouble is the only reason that got found out is because the Ohio newspaper printed his actual remarks\nThe Ohio newspaper already ready for the new Sally yes I'm ready [noise] okay um if\nI Want to talk about Trump's press conference today on the line I'm at the White House he was really on a roll I don't know what it is the last\nWell he was happy he was

mean the only been the most people are going to even use that that some cuts and I but I thought it was hilarious\nSo they ah somebody agree the the the Canadians especially they are they they were

going to you're going to get like a Marc Stein treatment and a Canadian human rights or\nSo so he wants so we was happy about that and uh\nHe was but I also will say I think it's a combination of him being happy\nAnd also him knowing that the base is very riled up right now because of this cabinet thanks so he's going out this is old school Trump this is from when he was on on the campaign trail

[laughter] without all about it [laughter]\nHe is that is that is that racist [laughter]\nYeah you know and and again I think I think Trump should also point out to ... and you know he's he just keeps saying it you know they they finally had to admit it fun day\nIt was so bad this lying and ... and it was so widespread he did it everywhere he went in Connecticut talking about coming back to from Vietnam and being spat upon\nBut finally he was called out by the New York times the New York bleeping times\nThat's that's how bad does it have to be for the New York times to call somebody out anyway\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two for one three says it's time for the FBI to reopen the Hillary investigation yeah that'll be the day remembered Trump's Trump's that I decided to move on it wasn't good for the country may maybe he should reconsider that as well\nBut anyway this this is really outrageous what's going on now with a Brett Kavanaugh I mean it you know once he's on the\nCourt if he gets on the court I I Hope he gets on the court I'm not sure even now but once he gets on the court or if he gets on the court this will seem more like a\nLike a botched joke by the Democrats it's just so outrageous what's going on here they it's it's like the Russia investigation everybody knows I busted joke\n[laughter] the\nThe Russia investigation one was the last time they actually mentioned Russia it's been a long time hasn't it I'm not even sure what the may major allegations talking points et cetera are in the Russian investigation anymore and even though the Brett Kavanaugh\nSo called investigation is only been going on for a month or a couple of months I mean they've already moved away from the initial allegations again ... I mean we're not talking seriously anymore about\nAttacks on a on Christine Blasey Ford or any other woman now the allegation is\nHe's a he's a heavier drinkers then he said that he didn't actually\nHe shouldn't be brought up on charges of lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee because he said he liked the beer\nWhen actually he loves beer and eat a little eddies and he is not the way he he's he doesn't just gets sleeping when he drinks he fought he passes out you'll notice he said he got sleeping when he drank mean again\nYou know human beings right that's the that's the the effect of alcohol a depressant on a human being\nIn the ... you get sleepy you fall asleep eventually if you drink enough even\nTed Kennedy even Ted Kennedy\nThat's why he needed to do other things other than ... so that he could stay awake to drink more\nWhat Ted Kennedy would think about this ongoing attempt to to have prohibition of straws wouldn't require him to have new new ... new twenty dollar bills in his possession at all times anyway\nThis is how outrageous it got though this this weekend the u._s._a. today never great newspaper\nBut it was it was somewhat respectable and it's a day now it's just as bad as the New York daily news I mean that there's not even the ... there's never the New York times as bad as it is might occasionally break a story\nThe the Washington Post the good work on the ... a rape case back in the day but what is USA Today ever done\nIn terms of\nAny kind of journalism mean breaking still important news stories it's never done anything\nIt just comes to your when your when you were to marry a hotel or Hyatt hotel on a business trip and you wake up in the morning and you go outside to go down to the continental breakfast and you trip over the paper that has been left for free outside your door that's that's USA Today\nAnd it used to be that they had later scores than the national newspapers but that doesn't but now that you have a cell phone\n... what does it matter if they have later scores of the if they have the west coast games in the in the final additions and I don't even think they have the I don't even like they have all almost half the final a final west coast games or the Monday Night football score\nBut anyway over the weekend they have a they have a sports columnist named Eric Brady that's Eric with a K this is what he wrote\nYeah I mean the how low\nCan these people go I Want you to think about this before I read this to you\nThe U.S Senate may yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are all around\nThe nation is deeply divided sometimes would feel I feel like we don't agree on anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nHow how twisted you have to be the right that and and and how\nHow the brave do his editors have to be to let that Ron credibly accused there's there's there's no one supporting any of these stories that the\nYale expose exposure story the New York times wouldn't touch that story they said they couldn't they they interviewed dozens of people no one no one back that up the gang rape story that was put out by the creepy born lawyer that's even more preposterous\n\nThis is Mollie Hemingway and the federal is the article which was illustrated with a picture of Kavanaugh and one of the girls basketball teams he coaches has since been dramatically revised\nApparently editors at USA Today belatedly realize that calling a human being a pedophile with perhaps precisely zero actual evidence of any sexual propriety was indefensible\nBut this is what this is what they're up against you you know Russia said this before and I think he's right that the the sports media isn't even more detached from reality than the the political press corps\nYou know at least a few not an effort declining percentage of people on in the uh Washington press corps have actually covered the real world you know they've actually been outside the beltway\nBut the sports media it's it's all\nJocks ... and ah and licks peddling and a sucking up the athletes and ah ended and they they want to be\nPC they ... they want to do you think what Brian James is impressed with this yeah I I don't know if somebody tells me he's not who who maybe Colin Kaepernick\nBut as we as we now know I mean what is this the ... Smith said he doesn't even think Colin Kaepernick wants to come back to football anymore 'cause you're making too much money as a spokesman for Nike\nWho's who's impressed with this credibly accused he calls Brett Kavanaugh credibly accused sex offender\nWhat do you have to do to get to get Sean\nBy respectable people and if either credible accusations and what are incredible accusations yeah ...

ridiculous at that point like their their justification is going to be you're you're using our yearbooks now what ... what are your books have to do with anything right now though it makes a lot of

know what the ... well no I agree that I\nHeard was that they were renting the unit out\nSo it was like a they made it into a mother in law was yeah it was only they didn't you you know you need you need to have a license to turn a permit from the city to turn it into a new place\nThe theory that I heard was that in that area it was very there are a lot of people who are renting out because I Know its Palo Alto exactly you know real estate's through the roof right and so they they put in the second door when they built in the other apartment there's numerous people who are listed as their address\nAnd then at some point in two thousand twelve they put like a fence or a wall up because the they were doing inspections they had like a poll also had an adult life go flag places that looked like they might be illegally renting\nI Gotcha okay yeah I don't know what the story is Suzanne thanks for the call by the way a actress Ellen bark and boy is she looking old by the way\nTrump should

five hundred forty to forty two and again I I Can't believe these ... these a snowflake or so\nAll journalists say why is Trump's O. P. O. to bought him claiming to be a Vietnam vet\nRoger when you have to be to to to run for office claiming over and over again it was this guy was the attorney general of his state forget the in the uh the the the senator he was the chief law enforcement officer and Sheldon Whitehouse was the cheap one worst one officer in Rhode Island I\nMean that's pretty scary isn't it these guys I mean not that it is it scary the Marin ... that you want for some officer in Massachusetts where the ... was in California but there are Schneiderman was in New York\nAll these people are pretty uh pretty frightening when you think about it you think do you think any one of 'em are believing due process really\nMark your next ... go ahead mark\nGood\nGood good I sent a quick note to my congressman Seth Moulton although I Can't stand but uh I actually demanded that he put forth the names of the people that have used that funding Congress to a quiet their users\nRight the Seventy million dollars that has been spent enough people who buy they've accused the congressmen and senators have various things not just sexual harassment there could be other things as well but we think though at least a large percentage of it was for sexual harassment right go ahead\nWell he he wrote me back he didn't actually give me any names which what are we really want it but in his letter to me he not only admitted that fought exists\nBut then I guess I'm congressman just sat does have a bill in Congress right now trying to get it removed and she also said that the victims of this abuse victim so if you're a woman it got sexually harassed\nThey're required to go to therapy for thirty days before that can even file against the guy\nRight right and you only have I have a certain level you only have a certain number of months who was to actually\nFile and then and they don't call it a complaint you you actually call it a request for therapy\nAnd then that's when they decide to give you the money so so you could never go back and say uh you know I Want a lawsuit I just I got some money because I was in therapy\nIn Congress by the way they were in the Republican who he I didn't know a vial that legislation with congressman Santa's but congressman this yet this is the Republican from Florida who's running for governor\nAnd he just resigned from Congress or he could run for governor so he's\nSo this is what happens to people who ... who tried to what to do something about the the the abuses of Congress whether it's a the the pensions\nOr uh or or this a slush fund that they have for sexual harassment they they don't stay in Congress all that long ago by a four four or five hundred forty to forty two um our car [laughter]\n\nThey're back as regular as low as equally revenues were
