something short or we can project that so you might want to take it earlier so there's a lot of things to consider and I have an interactive tool to use with folks and so when you come to the office will plug all the numbers in and we'll start we can share your break even point\nWhere you know ... cents there's other factors to consider in such as your cost of living adjustment\nUm the um maybe if you're going to invest that money and not spend it or what's the rate of return on that\nAnd I'm so there was a handful of things that we can look at it and your life expectancy and we can we can make it Ninety we can make you know it was all of that to give me an idea of what a you know the best scenario is going to be\nWell you certainly have all of the tools that that you need to really come up with a good decision on this had good plant okay our last question Tom from hand can't I still invest after I retire and how well\nCertainly you can always you can always invest in them you have the resources to do it that's great and so I you know what specific investments you're talking about I don't know but uh\nIf you are if you have money um you know let's say you have a foreign K you're rolling over about your nest egg mhm are you still want to invest it uh but you want to do it personally about risk management earlier\nAnd um you know how to do it in my opinion you'd want to hire somebody like myself or to help navigate that forty because for a lot of folks um [noise] you know they don't understand the markets you know certainly as well as I Do they don't have certainly my experience of ... twenty five you're doing this\nAnd um you know when it comes to having to withdraw money if you need to draw income from that pot of money it's a is a special way of doing it you just can't go put money in and ask people have hundreds on and take your chances that's a recipe for disaster like imagine you know the previous decades so uh so you can do it\nBut I I Would seek some help or guidance before doing it um\nAnd uh you know I for a lot of my my clients where I Do the act of management or I was off for something called wealth guard you know it's just a safety net or so for managing a portfolio you have a million dollars or managing for you you ... guard number might be ten percent which basically says you know if we\nCount false ten percent or get out you know we'll just yet you know get on the sidelines for a bit and uh that that is a again a safety net\nIn addition to the money management services that are provided it's never happened meetings and we've never hit that those trigger points uh you know not to say a count can't lose value from one month to the max but nothing drastic like that so I'm not sure if that peace of mind that wealth Cairo's it's all about how the mind and\nWhat you offer every client right not something that correct to opt in the\nArabs right it's part of part of the a part of the package and people really love it because not only is it alerts you and how you're doing and as you hit new highs and it also um allows you to you monitor if you're if we're not doing great because\nYou know ... what's the worst thing you want to do if let's say you're on his folks will watch looks at your statement once a year and there are people that did that\nAnd so they haven't heard from their advisor or the broker or whatever and\nThey do not Fifteen twenty percent and they're scratching their head and how to how it happened ... where's my advisor yeah well this alerts you to what's going on as often as you want daily or ... or once a week or I get on a daily you know with all all the accounts that I managed and um so it allows you to go hey\nAnd pick up the phone or comments across what is going on by likelihood as I'll call you because I could sing [laughter]\nSo I'll I'll be proactive and let you know reach out\nTo you and say okay this is what's going on in the market right now and this is why these changes in our happening I'm the market's down so much percent and oh by the way you're you're down a fraction of that or just in comparison\nTo twenty four seven monitoring ... ... no notification system that is really terrific um set with any of our listeners out there I'd like Paul caffeine in Tom and you have these questions these really good questions and you need an expert to talk to about him\nI highly recommend that you give credit to call\n'em at Cape retirement wealth advisors five eight to one seven nine three fixate that five and eight\nTo one seven nine three six eight or just ... keep protecting my radio dot com and you can register for a complementary no obligation personal retirement ...\nAgain so many calls recently off the radio which is great and I think everyone who's\nReaching out to me and they pay you great complements Everytime you has right on the radio [noise] um [noise] but uh [laughter] so that goes there really is a really complimentary appointment is no obligation [laughter] so I got really a it really is so we said if it weren't\nTrue right now I'm I'm happy to educate you knew um obviously my my goal is to hope that you become a client I mean

he really means that I mean I learned something new every time we come in and do this show so and and and he enjoys being able to explain\nThe ins and outs of things so that you know definitely um complementary and no obligation and that you definitely will learn something from ...\nUm you know what we we have a little bit of time here that anyone\nCan tell you about a client experience I Would love for you to tell me about the climate there but I had I had a\nCouple of ... separate issues or or to two different clients um but um I someone around what you're talking about somebody came in we did a review and um [noise] the conversation going through their expenses we were talking about a they're a homeowner's insurance was through the roof\nAnd a question to yeah and the referred him to somebody else didn't become a client or at least not yet not yet but he saved a save like Fifteen hundred dollars a year on is a really southerners insurance so he does something yeah\nLet's see ... you might just do that and there was something else about it we're above deductible that was eliminated\nVersus the old policy had a lot of times if you don't shop around it's like anything else you just don't know we don't know and so sometimes it takes a second set of eyes to look at things to point out and say that's a little fishy maybe you want to look at look around so that's one thing and the other one\nUh I was meeting with a client and who is ... now than at the time\nOr at least the Chris why am I so afraid of this afraid of the time it was just talking about just talking about retirement planning and all that\nAnd uh in this case it's because it's a big decision yeah it's a big deal and how many shots to get at it you get one if you're sixty six and you're retiring and you're coming to see me or somebody else\nIt's a big decision on what what you're going to do and where you're going to go and how you're going to handle it is you get one shot at it you can't make a mistake and that's why you get that beer\nOkay Chris where we have friend out of time for today but what a great show I learned a lot and I I help our listeners did too\nYes and thank you ... anyone

its way down in southern Florida beaches at the beginning of this week beaches one after another of clothes it's considered a public health emergency it's a more serious red tide than normal according to Florida in a\nA press reports it because ... trouble breathing and sinus infection simply being on the beach can affect you because the thing is is an airborne toxin which I Know it's not just getting in the water and touching something\nObviously the floor the economy I have no income tax and Florida is heavily dependent on property sales tax is people buying vacation homes their homes as well as tourist dollars so this latest red tide is caught the attention of politicians and businesses who are acutely aware that the tourist season for self words about the gear up\nThat's been touched down there I'm All right well Singapore\nThe lines like s Q twenty two took off Thursday from Singapore and landed at Newark liberty international airport in New Jersey at five twenty four AM

exception to that we have experienced so much growth\nThere's so much interest in our destination because of all the different things\nUm I think that one of the things that work very very proud of them but we have a merged as we become one of the leading food destination country a lot of people don't know that\nWe talk about the last time I ever had been traveling really go together and that's

that's how we got him discovered these folks there are seven living\nStories that we ever as we traveled a full region of the south and we invited these folks to become members of our wedding hotel collection just a few years ago so it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nGood to hear so from what I understand you do have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not travelled or state and

collection\nSo for instance you could go to greater Ashville area in the mountains of North Carolina maybe for some beautiful fall color like I didn't like eighty percent of them living people um consumers book a trip to go to the fall color and she's got seven rooms all decorated\nIt looks like the pages that suddenly the magazine and the food that there is based on other leading recipes and

or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know when you're a scientist your scientists have long said disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have said now I've seen the hurricane situations\nI changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact one in ...\nWhen I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back and we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say I mean they were saying what if I'm a scientist and say it's worse than ever\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda like camp during this just also have a political agenda\nWhere was it Angola the the altered climate change data it's science was as Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect is no disagreement than the scientific humidity it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back\nAt that

of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had near record snowfall and the reason why the\nNorth Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold periods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process so the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland\nHas had well above normal snowfall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so ... an article is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking\nHigh about five six years ago then they came down below in their back your normal now let me let me say this president answered the question perfectly here's why up until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so did her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe that climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you want just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now or\nYou know whether anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay but when you look back at the earth temperature as it go out and cooler and then warmer and the warmer and then cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that is by now
