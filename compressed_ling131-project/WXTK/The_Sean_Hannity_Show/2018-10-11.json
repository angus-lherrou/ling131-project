well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys the application and the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows they'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod

appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must come in\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his

would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include in located number so we we need all that information\nAnd it can it get stronger find that we didn't you get talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to say\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero

thankfully there's whole\nI'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox show you a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness state just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm\nNow I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book you know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and Sean the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have a gym up this rage not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you\nHave to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital so that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left and I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this if this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach men of Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible or for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that\nOnly drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not ah in positions\nOf power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump what you've been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget shown that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThose are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written

only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline

Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well he's a what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe

seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera\nWere just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know isn't iconoclast I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things\nNobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little

that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world and I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on

piece\nOut it's it's not generally well known I never knew this but the son of Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or her son happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that\nRice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nAs a student news outlets citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nAt the Stanford Daily quoted a law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera and

as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize if there are a lot of unsavory people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are [noise] uh when we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people
