change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemembered the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in
