here I Know you want we want to talk about two topics but the first thing you want to mark this week being like actually I guess it was a Tuesday of this week the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Boeing seven forty seven\n[noise] that's right ah September thirtieth was the fiftieth anniversary of the rollout of the seven forty seven which to this day if you ask me and and many other people is the most important and most influential jetliner in in history a introduced\nI didn't know introduce economies\nOf scale and then and that allowed for the first time large numbers of people to travel long distances ad affordable fares more than any other playing it changed the entire aphasia or ...\nI didn't know that it was the first uh you know airplane with two while so I knew of course it was a double decker with that ... knows but I didn't know what was the first was ...\nIt was it was the first a wide bodied jets and and watch absolutely remarkable it it went from a literal drawing on the back of a napkin to an actual flying airplane in just a little bit over two years now than when I\nMore than it was more than double the size of a existing playing and built it from scratch in just a little over twenty four months to Eddie and nowadays it takes five years just to design the variants of an existing play it I mean that was just incredible considering it at the the era and what what had happened the Nineteen sixties the late sixties\nAnd considering what I Know from having read your column on this this week it was twice the size of any existing passenger plane at the time which is extraordinary to be able to build it in two years to\nSurely and and it's it's a beautiful place and it was an is a beautiful place I mean so much more elegant then then the a three eighty which is the plan that superseded it finally in in terms of size hits you know I call it the Empire State building of airplanes it's not the biggest anymore it's not flashy is\nBut it's still the most elegant and and the class he is [noise]\nAll right I Know another thing that's been on your mind is the overcrowding of airport lounges we're talking about the ones where you have to be a member or have a credit card that allows you in a particular lines lounge and I've got to say I agree with you I mean ... airport lounges don't seem necessarily quiet highways anymore or they\nYeah and I don't understand why more travelers are are\nConcerned about this why is it more of a point of controversy here maybe it is and I just haven't picked up on it but you know maybe I sounds duty but I always thought of the the first or the business class lounge as a place of some exclusivity of of luxury or even even extravagant she to some level and yet\nYou go into the law just today and they're kind of a cross between a cafeteria and a daycare center I'm nervous\nAbout it and in part because it's so easy to get in and you have this credit card and then this level you can command and you can bring in some cases unlimited gas I mean it's crazy the ... in in some lounges I've actually seen people standing at eating\nFood out of place while they stand in a corner because there are no seat and on top of that you've got an issue with children being brought in an eel off and are very unruly baby screaming kids running I was in at all I Want you to Amsterdam racially and they were kids running barefoot throwing themselves furniture\nI mean this is supposed to be the premium clash ... the executive lounge we used to call it right\nYeah have you heard anything in in in in hanging around airports as you do and being in the airline business whether airline companies are concerned about this I Know they're trying to you know up the food offerings and so on but are they talking about building bigger wins\nOr what can be done I mean short of building all new and and much bigger lounges which in a lot of cases is a non starter I mean really the only way to deal with it is to restrict the the passengers who can enter may be a\nYou know how to dive lounge it'd be only for first in this class passengers period or if you're going to let people in through third party perks or you know ... what a [noise]\nUm let that'd be the case it's only when I'm just at a certain capacity or less a and maybe limit the number of gas that people can bring it but it's it's kind of out of control at this point and something needs to be done\nIn the last Fifteen seconds we have left you want to or anger parents everywhere by saying one of your wishes that kids under a certain age will be allowed in [laughter]\nWell you know\nBut it's not about kids it's about\nBad parenting I hate to say it and the topic we can talk about separately all day of one or two\nYou can read Patrick's writing an essay about a duck on his new book or the new version of his book is cockpit confidential Patrick thank you stopping by any kind of like you really\nAre immoral travel my eyes are open

Nunes is California\nWhen Rosenstein appointed the special counsel\nThe lead investigators knew\nThat there was no evidence of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia [noise] so what has a special counsel been doing this whole time\nThey're really looks like it's pretty clear now that is an investigation in search of a crime because of the very thing the Trump campaign was investigated for colluding with the Russians\nWe now know but it was the Democratic party colluding with Russians and feeding it to the top levels or the FBI the general counsel of the FBI\nThe Obama administration was operating on Stalin this principle show me the man and I will find you the crime\nDevin Nunes has knows that you just can't can't say it publicly because he's a member\nOf the ... of the
