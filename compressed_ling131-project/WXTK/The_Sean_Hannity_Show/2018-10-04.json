suspect is in custody\nIt's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party that in every single case even though there is no cooperation even though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged acts of violence say it didn't happen\nAnd the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis\nTo rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups that's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about ... hours\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil such raw power are the kinds of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nAware of how how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in that that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats that would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal in fact\nThose things I think I mean that the Susan Collins who was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court could deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote on ten specific\nItems in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nFor silver out of work to them but we're coming back\nAnd now we have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be you want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs\nProfessional and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a chain ones constitutional judges not radicals I think we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear a optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly and Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill of Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the scene Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course no that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you're gonna lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wage a campaign and I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hard working decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example\nA government run health care means taxpayer abortion\nWell they are very few places in America over there is a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very

beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses if there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are\n... and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse\nI Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole

a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get suited lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public

... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what

they were putting drugs and they were drug in girls almost on a weekend basis I went to ten of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train rape as they were lying in the hall and the ...\nWell I saw him near the punch bowl and and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top and the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases\nNo corroboration not the case of professor Ford not the case of this Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweating it know co-op ...\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing welcome\nBoth of your back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rapes somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless John Smith rape somebody\nThat's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nOr the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers ... you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now we examined\nEvery single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has to happen who's Julie sweating it is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and\nI just want to say something that I Know are probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her\nThat the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then she said\nOh I there was genuine surprise that remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats\nDeborah cats by the way who said well Paula Jones only spent ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken but\nI ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy with except that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety\nNow why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe because we're talking about the we all know\nThat there are real evil predators there are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations and charges seriously they handled it professionally they imported

out\nUnless it's some of us who are in the ad council\nNews breaks out we break in the WICK West Germany gate God and I ... radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\n\nProfessor of Ford's account well they sprung into action and they began their own investigation and professor forwarded mentioned that there were four people at the party where this\nAlleged assault had occurred\nAnd they did their due diligence and they interviewed the four people and under the penalty of a felony all four people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including professor for one of our best friends\nAnd professor forwarded identified mark judge who's the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons than all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up\nWell in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well well in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have a time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest\nAnyways so they had very limited room to to corroborate professor Ford story of what the the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case remember they were never going to make\nConclusions are recommendations that is what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnyway they sprung into action they went out we had already had professor Ford's\nA testimony now multiple points\nKnow even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate and our test and the the count that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post dot hand that over to the FBI so\nDeborah cats who was the liberal activists attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... come on I was only ten twelve minutes\nAnd that doesn't constitute any type of work for sexual harassment\nWell that shows she's not consistent on the issue that was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein who's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him a thing that any of this is going on that's the left wing activist lawyer though\nThat professor Ford I or don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all anyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case professor Ford was to ask\nThough for people that are ready testified under the penalty a felony the same questions that you would normally ask where are you there do you ever recollection no no no no no and mark judge your supposedly an eye witness did\nYou see this behavior this account a professor ports happened no and after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss\nThe story that already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial and the story been told in varying accounts and the Washington Post and when professor for testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt wasn't that hard a job for the FBI Democrat says oh now the fixes it what are you talking about\nWhat what else can they do at that point what other investigative tools they have\nIf somebody makes a serious allegation about a a serious crime committed and they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it\nThe person that has accused denies it there's no other\nVenue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into\nThey went further even though the New York times had well a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez his story this is the\nThis is the case that happened that was printed by the New Yorker member of that particular case and in the ... case she was claiming well back in the first year when he was a freshman in college said he exposed himself to me well after the New York\nPiece came out in the New York times they went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all and then the attempt to corroborate the story of Mr ... New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody times doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nKavanaugh was the one who exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add to it\nAround his mission achieve quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories and of course we've got\nYour number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweating it as soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali anyway\nA lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News but does she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one of his dad and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and you had an ex boyfriend that had found a restraining order against her and it and I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd oh anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here I remember Mr wet neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett Kavanaugh as a teenager\nIn high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drug in girls against their will\nMaking sure they got an ... capacity hated and that\nThey would line up in the halls of boys and the boys would then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well\nI don't know if he's by the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd lining up in the hall while I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a hall\nIs is not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd number two guy at the DNC always thinking of resigning his position as the number two guy at the DNC not one person not one Democrat angry today that the FBI investigation didn't go on and in perpetuity\nAnd that we're going to get a vote finally on Saturday up or down if if judge Kavanaugh's if we if this stands what they have done here\nWithout any kind of operation in any case and I'm not even talking about the outright lies that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media\nBut if you if we're now going to convict people based on accusation guilt by accusation or is Spartacus Cory Booker said wow I
