I'm going to real well they got thirty seconds I don't have time to get into another subject carrier\nOr Mr Mr ... which I appreciate that but I Do think it's interesting\nThat you had it you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nOur to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. OJ face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this anyway now James Baker is saying\nAnd Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a cave and that leads to page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed and private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... at least a page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again we're all was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI directors that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... just after market may they still have anywhere from ... uh proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that rose to see a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with hot in the theater I'm sure you're talking about the history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas only ... well at least a pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThat says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down it's just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jerry why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to deposed the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups\nWhat's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead serious ...\nDirector called me telling congressional investigators that an attorney from ... law firm gave him materials remember that's the law firm that she funneled money to\nAbout Russian election interference during the twenty six team presidential campaign so stunning revelation since it directly contradicts the Justice Department and the FBI

recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three also the guy that signed the fourth and final of Pfizer warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the whole she'd say something that they could use and then vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same dossier that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department were all during the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg ...\nTo you with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nOr as we continue John Solomon of the hill investigative reporter Greg Jarrett number one New York times best selling author of the Russian hoax of phony Russia investigation was based on her own verified aren't corroborated\nBought and paid for ...\nAll of the all the media elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election oh hookers in a bad urinating and the and the rich and Moscow\nAnd then literally leaking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources ear so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that fact that's right I mean\nYou cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a there's a guy that testified a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting defy using that information from Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if there hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they ... process and yet they're using it presented as fancy to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before ... ... ... and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like that that Hillary paid for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know just the fights alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties for perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is in existence\nBecause when we get all these ... applications John that the president said he wanted the class or non redacted when are we going to get the warrants what are we going to get the thrill to news we don't we know that Bruce or was working with Christopher Steele Christopher Steele is trying to pass on information\nAbout is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud\nThat's right with the president is listening for the Justice Department I mean the guy who said hey there might be some problems here we don't really want you to do this he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hid from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that Hillary Clinton paid for the main evidence used to open an investigation of Trump's campaign\nWhen I got to leave it right there John Solomon great work well have you on Hannity tonight Greg jar we'll see you on Hannity tonight eight hundred nine four

the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot\nIt was a three and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when ever having conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles blocks lesson huh you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWondering ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from our coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care but everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something ... just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nA but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets empty and they have a preexisting condition a doctor ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody is priced at the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over then to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that one of only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've weighed you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those\nPercent off everything in a store and the new Steelers necklaces engagement ring bracelet everything in the store is present on Cape Cod moments and was watching a news jewelers main street down in Cape Cod now everything is fifty per cent on avenue Z jewelers do today\nAnd\nAgain I don't know\nHow long the morning I\nEconomy is now in order most I mean you\nThen just a pain store\nHere in Hyannis on and we have three different SUVs you can choose from\nPilots the lodges U.

not escape the wrath of hurricane Michael\nA it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but gosh the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is\nA this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\n... over a million power outages we expect occurring\nAnd not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina if you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst\nThe worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this as as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person in may have twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me\nHe is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the price of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense now\nHe was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse is over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that right\nRosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nDon't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McCain Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about what would regard to find some warrants you know that it was an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you'd think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents wind question in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just pay and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony does the aid that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate because obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring\nNot only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peter structure tech confirmed that there is no there are there but anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller but there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation\nWhole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate a Judiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ...\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she's really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in

category five hurricane now slamming the panhandle of Florida Panama City exactly where we told you it was going to hit we have guts of a hundred and Seventy five eighty miles per hour storm surge up to thirty feet\nA and the center is hitting hard in theory is and fast just those Joe ... a predicted since Sunday and his forecasted on this program yesterday and he joins us now from whether bell dot com the official meteorologist or the Sean Hannity show\nUm everything you said and more a cat for maybe borderline cat five\nYeah landfall now it's it's inland now thirty to forty miles and we want to give you said at the track of this is going to be very uh right through middle Georgia a live very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south of the track for instance uh looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between a sixty and eighty miles an hour near and southeast of Augusta\nAnd in Columbia say fifty five Seventy five year in southeast of there so the track of this by tomorrow night\nUh will take it or to take it probably a north the Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the or reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out\nSo that's how we're expecting this to move or over the next twenty four thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me go through there is a little bit more first of all I mean the the governor's saying I Hope to God that nobody said that ... people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I\nMean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred in in some of these coastal areas um but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and trucks\nYeah I ...
