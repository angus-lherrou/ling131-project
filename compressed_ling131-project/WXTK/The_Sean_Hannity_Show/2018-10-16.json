West Germany Cape Cod and I hardly radio station news radio Ninety five WMGK\nHere's the latest from ABC News' Sean choked secrets of\nHard to believe that's how President Trump describes the devastation left behind by hurricane Michael in Florida and Georgia to states he spent the day tour and just see this\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ...\nThat Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence was\nGreat piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but sticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason Chaffetz is with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there this this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name\nAlong with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nWas going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and and I hope they send you were talking to your former friends and telling them to get them to uh get in to the Congress to take that said and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in usa peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss than Mr liar\nSimpson or all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena is who we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the fight the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nAnd by the way even\nHer lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed it this way Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district call me as relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us I Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done

you know Sean this is one where I first of all Hi nice to hear your voice and\nDoes he say Ollie hates when she has her agree with me and she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer is\nAh when I was an organizer you know before you and I met I was a community organizer I used to organize protests like you know going to\nPeople's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right because that's\nWhere the people's business is supposed to be done but we're talking people's lawns et cetera um you know look I support and a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protests now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out\nA you know going up to you know in a crossing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera\nI Do think you are I I Love you said you're dancing both sides 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or knock the crap out of them or\nKnow maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we can talk about violent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad but like ...\nRhetoric is now the tactics of the the hard the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children all oh well I I I haven't met maybe made meals

follow them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm not here in the Republican side and my point to you is this look I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're gonna have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ...\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own letter of\nProtest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... or ...\nYeah but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face\nAnd if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government you know you know one thing I and I pulled the tape and play it for you right now I always said about\nObama the number one leave his kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did\nAnd I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many\nTimes I can play a loop of it if you like to hear what\nI don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look first of all you're ignoring the wishes of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all your your seem to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up for him saying I got to hurt and if you know I'll defend you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened you know not all that sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no if you want me to answer the question\nI didn't take that and it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the
