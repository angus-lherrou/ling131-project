for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits through the economy as a whole it also friends to the press further wages blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was just 'cause I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration alright amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and the you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton\nWould have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on a loan that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\nI get that that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact would that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that that Mexico that decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they were turned back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision as to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd they're blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that would could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember\nIn the near future the next few weeks our policy should be to hope for the best\nAnd every week what a grand in your hand made possible by me of course you know uh if you really want to give

so far at all and we don't know if they were alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC\nNews reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox\nNews for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been ... tone deaf and silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it tell you a little story so I had this ... and and window lived through\nThis and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office the Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her\nAnd she was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us than we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was her age and\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about\nI mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah\nBut I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats I picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spit on you or threaten you or follow you\nI have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians have\nWhoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible by immediate that China exploited for political gain when it is a serious significant threat they said well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news no truth is ... ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable the hip hop or see how many of you know how many reported that three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president and secretary of defense Mattis\nIndoor FBI Director ray and to our CIA director Gina Haspel\nAnybody even hear about that\nI didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people are getting these\nThis is happening every day this is a very very dangerous political environment everybody needs to take a deep breath you don't like you you you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker go vote for\nYou want Chuck Schumer to be said or majority you have the ability to go vote on so and so's governor go vote keep your hands to yourself and uh you know and keep it in and leave people if they're in public alone\nOr at least leave the women all up
