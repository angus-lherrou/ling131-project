that's the fourth Pfizer warrant the third renewal application all of it based on the pony dot CA\nIn every case of fraud committed upon the pies or courts and then the same information that we now have learned the media leaks strategy that existed\nJust before it leaves a page that nobody had any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter Struck said there's no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nWhen in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt\nOr whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty I used to manipulate not only buys a court judges and commit a fraud on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lives on the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they weaponize what turned out to be nothing but a ... bumped that documents that its own author will stand by anyway why won't Rod Rosenstein now appear under oath before the committees of Trey Gowdy and Bob\nThe ... where's the subpoena demanding that he turned over the the three oh to lose the pies awards all these things that have been requested\nJim Jordan who's joining us Freedom Caucus member candidate to be speaker of the house of representatives if the Republicans winning twenty six days\nAnd congressman Dave Brat of Virginia and by the way congressman Dave Brat it happens to be in one of those districts that is a very very tough but winnable district if you're in what district you in ... in the commonwealth sir\nSeventh seventh district shot that much\nIf you're in the seventh district in the commonwealth of Virginia let me tell you something we need Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus within that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made you know for the last seven years\nAnd he's been fighting hard every day and he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him defeated if you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you can\nAnd we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona how many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsked you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is Senate confirmed when he goes to his confirmation process he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress's question when called his answer that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... ... actually a account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he should be in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it ... just supposed to come in at Berkeley under oath or the your theory maybe he's the guy who won the Justice Department and understand the timeline\nOn may ninth Kobe is fired based on the Rosenstein Nemo or make six cases when he has his conversation with these the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... and of course may seventeenth is when Bob ... was named special counsel constantly in San ... what else happened on this thing\nThat today more went in there because of that but that director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and no one gets signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we what it's all you want to bring him in and ask questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this well first of all how has your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on the policy yet the healthcare immigration pact or\nMy opponent is a alert you liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions and because\nThey know they're going after you and never come back talk big time in our junior right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is ah my opponent the resist\nI she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out in the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabble collapsed and then Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the er the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan\nYou know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there they're listening to people want the full list that we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com good\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that ... their congressmen or a woman who was in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman tried\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there's the left today is that they apply capitalistic when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never a great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Neely says\nYeah it just it just how radical leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced economy going a four point to present lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do this thing can make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understand that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed\nThat the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein than acting FBI directed his after the firing of coal me Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up and in that meeting Rosenstein and the and McCabe or or\nBoth detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves or the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you mean by that uh they brought\nYeah well I just go back to the way your frame that you own a dot com it's all like you're in Iran over its I get the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason\nAnd now he won't show up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and he when he just sat in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and I'll let him go on with the ...\nYeah San ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right\nAndy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why companies should be fired one of the things ... looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me you've gotta be kidding me so that guy's going to oversee this so both of them had conflicts and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel any type of oversight\nI don't want to thank you both for being with us a congressman Brad the seventh district of the commonwealth of Virginia or one of the race in Virginia is Barbara Comstock seed is very very close race there um I Hope the people of Virginia get out to vote for you congressman Brad thanks for being with us you know like why don't we don't you hate somebody like Jordan who's going to run away with you know twenty point victory and his\nGet full details on the example policy has slowed down

Toledo what's going on Regis how are you\nI'm Shaun how are you I'm good what's happening\nAt Jim Jordan and Dave Brat on there and you've had a a a Trey Gowdy I think previously over the past time but the thing that irritates me about when you talk to these guys and this Rod Rosenstein a fiasco that's going on [noise]\nYou'd never ask them why don't they just somebody stand up and make this guy up here and how does he keep his job when he won't come and you know go before Congress like he's being instructed to\nWell I mean that's a great that's a great point because you and I wouldn't be

talking no actually\nThat's not true I mean do you think of everything that we have gotten we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed at all of this happened they listed in every document we have gotten this because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou've given it to him on a platter but they will act on it for\nWell it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the leadership and the Republican Party that are weak and timid and learn nothing of the success of Donald Trump that

now the over I was watching on the Fox news channel it was an ad out there\nIt is now the number one best selling history ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrapped their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism and in this case that he was writing about not the ...\nIn the last century a hundred million humans\nSeoul destroyed now I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for the Nazi war criminals that even takes us to modern day and then it's extraordinarily well researched and I'm I honestly bill I think it's a very hard concept for people to understand\nThe type of evil that really truly existed in Nazi Germany\nIn Germany on a program and it is nice to talk to you welcome back to the have you very a very troubling Chinese were living in absolutely\nAnd I'm following you grow so you're on TV and radio\nAnd I wrote this book partly because I Want to get Americans to know that truly evil exists and that we can't turn away from it figures that we do we're going to find ourselves down the road facing a situation I wouldn't say it's going to be Hitler and the third Reich but\nWe're heading toward hate and the are dominating the country you know and you can see it you see what happened a cabin on the attacks on me and you see what

compare the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain with the aerobics understanding of evil in his time what Winston Churchill\nAnd Winston Churchill and the lead who's warning everybody you gotta

they get to Washington but when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is\nNo voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party I got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs up post chops and never come back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWhen they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just well humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like\nDo we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic difficulties like there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system and we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to\nLet you down well I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about saving neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be\nAnd you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary our our human our human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism
