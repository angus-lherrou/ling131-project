C. N. D. C. I remember get a call from Tom Brokaw ths producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices and they knock them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie well ... when you detonate the stuff but you know you blow to pieces it's harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps no writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages boosts who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their had the first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices or not we don't want to get a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nVices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious she would send those bombs\nAnd it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually developed\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this they're basically you know ... nations whoever this was you may have done this\nSo it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out that

able to do\nWhen they do they want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play that they are progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's got to be so liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie\nTo the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred\nAnd a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well Dave\nThough it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's better to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is that\nFor them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such a awful way\nHeard it on and give me my

species act\nIt prevents us from hunting the great white shark or calling the north Atlantic gray seal I understand that but what I Do want to know from you senators here because I've been asking you about this for two years Julian\nDo you support senator the calling of the gray seal population in and around the Cape and islands\n\nSo first this has been a really hard summer especially for those of us on the outer Cape I grew up swimming in these in these waters in these speeches are and how my family and friends recreate in these waters are this is changed in ... and ... notices change for for quite some time\nOn you know there's actually and and and as a delegation we worked in the United fashion or looking at what we've been doing as a state and how we can ramp things up\nUm and there's actually been studying a the division or Marine Fisheries have been studying this issue since two thousand nine and and there's a lot of interagency worked on you know civil war happening\nUh I think we need to do three buckets of things will get that in a minute I'm when it comes to ... you need to have the data and so anyone who tells you they want to go out and I'm\n... until there is a change in federal law we can't do that and so the only way you're going to do that is being grounded in science\nAnd let me interrupt play devil's advocate on her yeah let's just say let's say for the sake of argument because no one in this room\nKnows yet we don't know what we need to do to deal with the federal regulations let's\nJust say for the sake of argument that we got past that and we could have a hunting season on the gray seal do you senator see us here support that\nI don't know because I'd have to see what the data set and I was actually in Woods Hole known as there is it legitimately\nWhen we I mean the easy answer is to say barrel bomb all of them right and then you end up on national news um like one of our what someone here did a but I think the honest answer right if we got to look at this issue and when we humans Wade into waters and Wade into environmental met meddling\nNot knowing all of a science I think if a science show that they feel that that is that an overpopulation if the science showed 'em\nBefore the John right no I don't know I you know I Wish the or why did you think why do you think these great white sharks are here\nI think you're seeing a restoration of\nKnow I mean I just I I but I'm saying you gotta have the data and science or that and I know the easy answer is to say let's call the seals but there are we need to have data and we haven't had it on the guy got killed I Know and in my community I my friends were at that beach that day I had you know\nAnd and and this is\nIt's terrifying and it's especially terrifying for outer Cape Cod her head and and I was playing hardball I can I say this is this is a topic that you just answered my head and I'm young grants or am I hearing on the answer you you you down in Fort Collins you\nKnow if the science showed evidence for supporting it then I'd be supportive of that to find that\nJohn you've been very patient I appreciate it a patient guy yes you are\nCalling the a gray a sealed John for as well I think uh\nMy opponent a hit on a couple of issues that I think really needs to be addressed a first and foremost we have for all intents and purposes a [noise]\nA Congress that needs to take a look at\nUm the uh those those animals and uh uh then I'll listen on the endangered species act um I Know when I was a young kid back in the fifties and sixties uh also swim those waters are all along the national seashore when it first became a national seashore under President Kennedy\nUm trust me there were not why Chuck great white sharks than in the primary reason was you didn't have an overabundance of seals I mean it's sort of common sense um that when you walked in Muskegon island which is off of the talk of where I live for a number of years you got to see thousands and thousands of seals were the pups\nOr as a result of that draws in the great white shark because that's what it is that they want to feed on during the closer you support\nCalling the gray seals [noise]\nI I think we need to do two things one uh we need to look at scientific data I Do agree on that particular point I think we have to push the Congress or to be sure that\nThose animals that are on the endangered species ... endangered species list when they no longer a need to be which I Believe the seals are one of those populations\nUm that we should begin to think about telling them down the road or I Know when I was a child I'm sill populations were held on a regular basis by the local fishermen in in in ... and ... them\nBecause in essence they just basically a fish when they were catching when I back in the back in the nineties is starting to become a problem I used to I used to serve fish on a regular basis on a great point than it sucking up by the time you're real the fish in the ... the seals were taking it off the hook 'em\nI ... I I Know I'm interrupting I Know I Am and I and I know I'm being\nA little aggressive about this but I don't have a lot of time and this was an important important important issue to Cape Cod so we don't make the right decision for Cape is going to take a drastic\nChange\nIf you are elected state senator what are you telling us this evening John that you will or won't do on this issue\nI'm telling you that we need to take a look at obviously federal rules and regulations because they control this particular agenda item I Would be pushing a our congressional delegation to have a gray seals removed from the endangered species list\nSenators here I Know you want to [noise]\nSo yeah I I I Wish there was an easy answer to this and ... and let's just say for the for for\nFor for argument's sake that um this is a possibility that enable to happen there's still a whole host of other things that we need to do and that our communities and especially the outer Cape Town working with the national seashore working with our entire delegation Democrats and Republicans ought to prepare for next summer to prepare for twenty Nineteen\nWhat does that include that includes education right so for those of us who live in these waters were rather aware of the risk\nWe need to make sure that those are visitors are aware of the current race we need to look specifically at response ah you know these are tremendously inaccessible beaches\nI Know I I I you know rough on them on and you know we have to look at cell research cell service I Love the fact that I can go to the backside beaches intro and myself one doesn't work\nBut I think that's something that needs to change a you know we need to have preparedness um you know the whole there's a whole host of things right now the delegation of all of us Democrats and Republicans I'm how offered our support to the town there's a working group that we participate in of all the outer Cape Town to the national Park Service\nOr they're pulling together a a list of resources that were going to marshal or our collective effort to bring\nState resources to verify that are trying to find an easy answer\nBut I I ... yeah but but maybe there isn't if we call the\nFood source we wouldn't have these things running around and with all due respect\nUh to the various towns like well the way they talk about uh having bleeding clinics they talk about putting up towers so you can spot the damn things in the water this was not I would not recommend to a friend you go swimming at a beach where we are doing these kinds of things will go visit a town where you have\nArab bleeding clinics going on it's crazy and I\nOne last thing on when we obviously I feel very passionate I Know I'm just I'm a local guy in the water I vote in the water I got a real issue with what's going on at our film we all do we all swim well but I don't think public officials you know you all have done much with us with no disrespect intended\nYup well like you know I'll just closed by saying you know make one comment I ... it is a once again a federal related issue but we do have to take a hard hard work that calling that seal population somewhere down the road or else we're going to lose our beaches we're going to lose our tourism people I'm not going to come to Cape Cod if they can swim in the water it's pretty\nSad [noise] I Want\nOn and I appreciate the audience and the two\nCandidates for indulging my ah ... I'm just a local guy and I I Do get a little emotional about this particular issue I think we ought to be able to swim in our beaches without fear of you know\n[noise]\nAh John or you have\nAccused Sen seer a filing legislation you have a a radio ad that says that\nHe's filed legislation that allows for a one hundred percent increase in lead poisoning acceptable levels that is a radio ad I interviewed you on Monday and you had a different set of figures and you told me the legislation that he filed you you you'd reference to bills\nOr that he he jacked up to twenty five percent so if I\nWere what John if you could clarify this for us what exactly is your accusation um\nI guess percentage wise or what you're saying senator Sierra has filed for legislation as it pertains to lead poisoning acceptable levels I'm a little confused because you seem to be things and different things that well\nAnd that was that it was twenty five but it's really pretty simple of the um the the the gold standard the standard of excellence is that I'm\nA child who was who was tested for a lead it should never be more than five or ... or ... milligrams protest leader or in the bill that was filed by the senator um I have the numbers for you um it was clear that when you look at the research of the mass department of public health\nOn when it reaches five or it creates permanent damage to a child's health or the CDC with the center for Disease Control or they basically are recommending it should be two point five\nWas so significant that I thought we had to take action against him in the even if that would you feel that program here in Bahrain we we will we can't pick favorites like that and law a\nResponse from Belgium [noise] I think it's obvious that\nThe senator is sadly mistaken it's the reason that I have the endorsement of sheriff Jim Cummings uh one of\nA because he feels that my leadership will be a new direction a new set of expectations he knows that I support law or not is why I have the endorsement of the Massachusetts coalition of police is why I have the endorsement of uh\nOf was lieutenant governor camera bleed all of a governor Charlie Baker a host of different folks are including um including most importantly the sheriff himself a\nYou know Julian talks about ah\nBrussel county I I'd ask them what towns you represented Bristol county\nWhen when you're when you're a senator\nYou got to take\nThe answer is he doesn't represent any uh we ... the senator from Cape Cod in the islands represents the towns of Cape Cod Martha's Vineyard and the second and the fact of the matter is if an illegal alien is arrested\nI have no issue not does the sheriff\nBasically turning the information over the ice to basically say does this person to have a felony does this person of a misdemeanor against them so if that's the case they can be retained within the criminal justice system why would you just want to put them back out on the street if you look if you go to the sheriff Jim Cummings website\nOn a monthly basis he shows the list of all the different folks\nThat have been arrested under this particular rule under this particular law in the kinds of things that they've done is everything for felonies to murder style ribs you want to put those people back on the streets I don't I have four daughters and two granddaughters I have family I Want to be protective I Want to support Lawrence Otto you don't [noise]\n[noise] I Would say [noise]\nRowdy proud I like it I Would just say you know my record speaks for itself when it comes to public safety earlier today I'm ... I'm the only lawmaker and their first term in the Massachusetts Police Association to have diversity of lettuce that are of the year\nIn a hundred and Eighteen years of the math at least\nIf I if if if if my approach\nAnd my policies were were were so abhorrent and and we're we're truly as my opponent said I never received an award and by the way I I I work with Jim Cummings even though we disagree on something I have worked with him to make sure that\nFossil county is considered renting the opiate bill\nUh there were provisions that were at adversely really impacted the boss will county sheriff's department of impact Martha's Vineyard we work to\nUh actually make sure that they were taken out of the bill we wish your federal how I'm also proud to have the endorsement of um ... Bob Ogden who's the sheriff on Martha's Vineyard so you know my record on public safety is clear I'm proud of that record\n'em and it's something that I'm just very honored uh to have their support and\nSo we're clear senators here this two eighty seven GP ram I have an article here from the national news Cape\nCape news\nAh June first of this year and there's a quote in here from you and says I didn't say I supported the two and I didn't enjoy the program that or is that an accurate\nI I I didn't say at the border than taking the chef at his word and they want the chef what my interest is was this was happening and my interest was that we would be able to have a lens in who ... who was being turned over to ice because that that was my interests and\nSee that's actually not in line with ... with all of them that if this amendment came up again you would vote for it I Would vote for it as long as you're\nOn a ticket and you wouldn't or what what are the safe community you would not vote and it is correct okay one last thing and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys think about you got some questions just raise your hands and I'm going to go around the room one last thing a\nFor you John for us you and I chatted a watch on and I remember about the very first time I interviewed you uh what caught my attention about with you I was you had some very strong comments about a Julian age\nAnd you you weren't shy about it some quotes uh you said I remember when I was thirty and I thought I knew everything\nThat was the uh Nantucket newspaper or then it in a radio interview with one of my competitors just this past weekend I heard you say he has a no respect meeting senator she or he has no respect for people over fifty five\nSo pretty strong stuff coming from a from a from a place where I think the demographic if you look at it you don't want to upset the fifty five plus people well I'll tell you I'll give you a prime example uh it's probably not a good thing and they'll give me an example John of how how your opponent has disrespected people\nIn the ... times uh twenty seven saying quote unquote or from the paper we need younger folks participating in local government he said by younger I mean under the age of fifty five we need you want select when we need you on the planning board people over the age of fifty five\nOkay let me finish listeners and other ones are are in the Cape cod times um [noise] on October twenty ninth of twenty Seventeen of Julian ... that it was the same\nOld tired folks who constantly comprise the local boards and commissions that make the decisions it was good ...\nWell maybe the senator doesn't realize that but if it wasn't for folks like me who are over the age of fifty five those of us who served in local government you wouldn't have enough people serving on the boards whether it's selected whether ... whether it's plenty we do our job we give back\nFinally another comment or that someone just recently sent me and I quote a this was an email that you sent back to somebody who is over the age of fifty five and a this is the person who I didn't know but she she's now supporting my candidacy and she writes the following me as a response from Julian here when I asked him what his priorities are\nAnyone who spends more than a mere seconds glancing at my record realizes that I care about a great many things including el GB GQ equity but also housing affordability standing the opioid epidemic healthy aging erosion of the school safety that racial justice environment environmental preservation\nEarly childhood education and I agree with all of that but then he goes on to say it to be one\nGenerally resurrecting our society\nFrom the havoc that the baby boomer generation has ... on our country are you kidding me [noise] so what's it like that's disgraceful\nIt looks like the U.S Senator John it's shameful that you're trying to divide people and I I'm not I'm trying to show the difference between an eye\nI\nGuess I hit on I guess it was a good question [laughter] I\nMeant a lot to me because I'm twenty sixteen and I remember this feedback but I got from Democrats and Republicans alike I'm of the real college will productive a conversation and meaningful debate that we had an issues um\nI Will apologize when I saw that in artful things and actually that's an example of something or I did say something in our in our full that was a mistake one of the things I've actually learned as a state senator is sometimes you get into a back and forth with people whether it's on social media whether it's in emails you can't do that right you've got up I think as I say you\nKnow that shows that I learned I learned from my mistake that's a mistake and I'll admit it but you know more overt actions speak louder than words All right and so here's my record I went to bat\nTo pass an expansion of the senior citizen circuit breaker I asked to have a leadership\nRole how mailed her Affairs Committee [noise] um I\nLed the effort in the Senate or looking at home health care for seniors are you know and I just\nMy comment though the common in Martha's Vineyard times was about look you don't have to wait to get involved and we need more people to step up and serve especially locally of all ages junk you know that you know when you write for town council you went on a post and won by around two hundred votes\nLike that's that's a function of in an intimate participation in our representative democracy\nBack to the matter is open I stand on it and I ran over the age of fifty five\nMinutes are up to [laughter] you know and look we had\nIn twenty sixteen we had over four hundred volunteers ... we did the numbers over over the vast majority of them were over sixty and it's the same as to say my staff in my team is comprised of books of all different ages or ed McMahon has left the Denver sending a lot of these are folks are over fifty five\nAnd you know I I just think that look I I Will admit\nWhen I made a mistake and clearly especially in that that email that that was an email and a correspondence back and forth a with a with a constituent and you know what I made a mistake there and I'll admit that and I learned from my mistakes\nBut I think my record really clearly shows that I've gone to bat for every single person in the Cape and islands district regardless of their age and if anything I've gone out of my way to make sure that we're taking care of our seniors in our older adults would cut in\n... I I was thinking I just\nListen to news radio Ninety five ever do you actually case on live broadcast\nOf the Cape and islands state Senate a debate the fellows are doing exceptionally well this evening\nNow some on that now it is a now it's the turn of\nA large audience and I'll Try to get as many of you in as I can you can help me by just having a question quick one and you could help me by being as concise as possible because I have a feeling we have a lot of people okay hello there\nYou know I I rely on on folks who who\nHave some wisdom have some experience have some smarts um and and I'm also willing willing to be proven wrong and enter correct myself when I'm wrong calm so that's how we look at issues for the bus and\nJohn flowers are Julian seer candidates for came on state Senate ladies and gentlemen I Am so pleased one of the leaders of the town of ... a year or to ask a question my friend counselor or Jim ...\nA bunch for wholesome enjoy your show oh I like to see a man who I was younger I spent you guys doing a good job a nonpartisan", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "25"}
