he was given the constitutional oath in a private ceremony by chief justice John Roberts he was given the judicial oath by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy from Kevin replaces on the high court\nValley it was a grassy rights we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party with the accuser himself\nIf there's another one to hear I I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now\nBut the ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggest capital I wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers in a ... and ... before she could decide the capital may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that it's now it's somehow bad that Kavanaugh want it to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSolve this I mean this is what the this is what they're up against this what the he's up against here and but I I don't think it's I don't think it's working I don't think anything is sticky cars that there's

of a T keep the heat on Donald Trump fuzzy heads to Mississippi for a campaign appearance tonight on behalf of the Republican Senate candidate down there and um\nIt's a Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he reaped riches from his father he reaped riches from his father you inherited money\nAnd then here's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way is a is a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built what I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich can not be reduced to handouts from his father but that's what we've done in the headlines we've reduced it the handouts from his father 'cause that's all anyone's gonna read no who's ... who's got time to read all this they say that\nA Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year as part of Fred Trump's effort to hand is money down\nWell pretty good for a three year old [noise] [noise] well I you know\nThere are guys that have they have they're the guys in the launch woman's union in Boston who as soon as their son is boring they signed him up for the long Sherman's union so we can you know even if the kid as an infant isn't getting paid he's at least on the seniority list\nI mean isn't isn't that something that's traditionally done you try to help out your offspring Mitt is is that actually especially to avoid the death tax yeah\nAcross the decades aided and abated by less than aggressive journalism\nOr back to this again I'm just you know I haven't got time to read the whole thing it at a better by less than aggressive journalism Mr Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than ... so there there it is\nIt for four or five hundred forty to forty two I uh I Hope but Trump makes a trip to North Dakota just like you did to West Virginia I think he's already made a trip to North Dakota has any I Am pretty sure he has\nIf he's got ... if if if if he's ten points up I mean he may make one more trip just to make sure it's in the back but I mean ten points is that's that's a pretty good margin over a a over a ... an incumbent senator at this break\nEight four for five hundred

blooming falls ever been accused of sexual harassment I mean he made up that story about being in Vietnam but book or a yeah Booker has admitted he wrote a column for the uh Stanford newspaper when he was out there in Palo Alto as an undergraduate saying that he had rubbed a woman at the age of Fifteen\nYeah I Know ... so I bet only said should ... someone in the intro was saying if you harassed a woman in high school your life should be ruined I mean what about what about Cory Booker he admits it Kevin Kevin ... denies it Corey admitted it\nWell you said a judge jam and also though they make a sexual out is Asian but also it is the one that went and fabricated his a Vietnam so you know go ahead and call him wrong so right going\nNo I agree I agree what about ...

his title of his latest book it seems particularly apropos for the moment ah that that we live in a rage ink\nAs an outrage incorporated a uh Derek guy the the uh the the outrage ink industry is ah is running three chefs this week aren't they\nAre coming out with a Jane Doe Jane Doe one Jane Doe to Jane Doe three every every hour there's a new Jane Doe none none of them have any facts but the the the mainstream media is just going crazy what their stories\nYou never let the facts and we're in now and I appreciate you having me no\nOutrage and distribute a growth industry on the left it's their only political tactic they need to keep people riled up terrified or angry in order to motivate them to vote because the alternative would be talking about the horrible things they want to do to this country but I'm telling you judging by\nThe media for learning and the amount of money being funneled to go front pages for these so called victims\nI'm thinking of coming out with a sexual harassment against judge Kavanaugh there's just\nToo much money in it right now it's it's ridiculous it any objective human beings especially an elected official ... look at\nWhat's going on right there and say yeah this is totally believable and absolutely normal who needs details ... who need evidence we've got a narrative that needs to be fed it's scary scary time and I'm afraid for\nWhat kind of country we are going to leave my children and I have one my second one due next week so my wife has a hand grenade and she's going to be born into this world\nYeah it's it's something I'm I'm just looking at the headline in the New York times Kavanaugh was questioned by police after bar fight in Nineteen eighty five minutes you think to yourself bar fight I mean you thinking you know punches thrown in a\n... you know people hit over the head and then you read that and in the in the the lead they admit that the only his only connection was he was he may have thrown an ice cube but somebody we that does that rang rise to the level of a bar fight throwing an ice cube of somebody\nI Want to know the person was\nCalled the police say they were they wearing a swayed jacket ruined my life jacket or it could amplify let this ice cube set on my shoulder long enough suddenly Chuck Connors with a battery on her shoulder but it's an ice cube offended to the point that there has to be an argument over an ice cube I mean\nI Would say we're at the point of absurdity but we didn't even stone when we cross that line we hit light speed when we got to the point of absurdity and now you've got MSNBC and NBC News running in an interview with Julie sweat Nick\nIn which she says oh yeah I've got proof here some names go talk to these people\nOne of them says I'd never heard of Julie sweating ... the other one is\nAnd the other two haven't returned NBC's\nCold right now how you know how journalism works if if you're putting a story together or you got nothing back and get up and in fact one of the people who says this is supposed to be backing up says no I don't know this person you know on that story\nBut they gave twenty minutes to that story yesterday on MSNBC and one clip during our email\nOr show and clips of it played on the nightly news I tape journalism is dead but it's been ...\nYeah you know we used to always say that in the old Hearst newsroom in Boston never let the facts given the way of a good story but we were just getting around you know I mean it's like the ... that's that's really a a\nA maximum now in a in some of these news rooms how about how about this with\nMichael out Mary from the Washington Examiner Michael ... said Monday evening that his client Julie sweating ... did not witness firsthand Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh allegedly spiking the punch at high school parties in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut he knows a woman who claims to have seen the act and while she is willing to speak to the FBI she won't go public\n[laughter] and they'll give her name's Dianne Feinstein and right now Mazie Hirono is ruling over the prospect of funding a bronze statue of this mystery well maybe it'll just be a cloud of bronze clout\nBecause they don't care anymore they're not even trying to be a time when politicians\nWould try to make plausible lies you know you weren't going right through you the truth was being massaged and that was sort of part and parcel for politics now they don't even try any more they throw it out there and then they walk away from it like they didn't have anything to do with it and they're onto the next one\nSenator Grassley sent a letter to Chris Coons today it's pretty brutal it's ... it's circulating now in social media\nAbout an allegation that Chris Coons sent his office\nWith no substance whatsoever that alleges that judge Kavanaugh may have attended a party after he graduated Yale\nAre strippers we're in its at his old frat ... like he's not sure he was there but he wants the Senate to looking to judge Kavanaugh's calendar for that year to find out whether or not he might have attended it's past the point you can't parity this any more they are overpaid\nAnd I give you I'll give you another one here this is a this is ... at\nAt last night at ten forty PM I have a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed of course who lives in Florida who told me directly but mark judge Brett Kavanaugh would spike the punch with rain alcohol and ...\nNot not grain alcohol or acquaintance but grain alcohol and ... I mean it\nCan we get Bill Cosby to comment on that is I mean I think that's a little bit of overkill isn't it but you're right there I mean I Do everything out there and just the you know we'll see what ever sticks\nI I think Bill Cosby is reading this cell going no I live in Lebanon quantity of both [laughter] I mean when I\nWent out last about drugging women\nBut I mean this is this doesn't pass the the smell test doesn't pass the laugh test it's ridiculous\nOn the outrage the guys I did you see the the crimson story there are forty eight Harvard law students filed a title nine complaint against Kavanaugh claiming that his very presence would be sexual harassment\n... yes and that that's part of the reason that his his class was canceled God Forbid you be taught law by a Supreme Court justice or a potential Supreme Court justice a federal district court judge instead they decided that he is ... ... I'm telling you\nIf you bring up the name Ronald Reagan\nTo are committed leftist activists they still get angry he's been dead more than ... years he left the presidency on many worry corny at how a Nineteen eighty nine and they're still mad that he ever existed\nThis is why they win ultimately on so many things because they don't let go they're like the Terminator they can't be reason and they'll never ever stop but it's generational\n... and yet I see I see here this story doesn't get any play I just mentioned the the candidate for governor in Colorado the Democrat who was accused of pushing admitted the cops he pushed a woman in Nineteen Ninety nine and gets\nYou know one you know one mentioned in the Colorado media never ... barely breaks the national press now how about this when they do homework apologizes for demeaning comments in college newspapers he said\nHe said the a ... a a ...\nSome of the actresses in a Broadway musical and if you add is at his and his college in Texas they're only qualification seemed to be there for a nominally large breasts and pipe by pox now ... what happened what happened if they can find Brett Kavanaugh saying something like that\nIt would be over there would be over you know that it is like a double standard liberal would have no standards at all about not driving it\nAt a debate in it right on that on a statewide TV yeah I Know it\nIt he said I call the person who was in the car with me and then they said they weren't trying to leave and besides where would we have to like what you were trying to flee on foot you were trying to drive away and witnesses had to stop you\nBasically have a way you go to if you're driving in her life\nWhat what someone like her walk with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a Barbie so he starts um he's he ah he start seeing\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time in fact sometimes with several\nAt one time she wanted to know that would be okay in our relationship I asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you get first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still like that from time to time she brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma do I reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of something significant that I didn't do it when people leave because of this and the turtle considerations meeting I guess the afterlife the pressure on me bill throughout the afternoon I had to explain my my wife and three years what happened twenty five years ago before we met in long before we married\nSo then he decides to go to was a pastor and talk to him about it\nAs I watched part of the afternoon confirmation hearing the next day and so I miss is Kevin looking so sad I felt that she needed to know that in a sense that's her husband was being mischaracterized\nMy heart's still feels heavy for me as well as Julian the capitalized that said based on my direct experience with Julie I Do not believe her allegations against Mr capital\nSo that's that's one letter we've got more letters to read as we go through it a mark your next without ... go ahead mark\nThank you alley and thank you for a truly

on paper Packard if the deadliest transportation\nAccident in the U.S nearly ten years a limousine crash in upstate New York Saturday is left ... dead investigators with an update this afternoon state police superintendent Chris Fiore and lead from New York Ford\nEnd of the day we get all that money back because we never used it but that doesn't work that how it works that's for sure so with a long term care looking at that vein I Want a return on my money that doesn't mean I'm looking to go into a nursing home and need to access those funds\nBut I'd like to know that my premiums are going to go towards something so if you use life insurance as an alternative ah to to do this you can invest that premium intellect insurance and what's going to happen either a you're going to use\nSome of that desperate to cover the cost of going into a nursing home so if you paid a premium yet a half a million dollar death benefit you could use a portion or almost all of it depending on the policy you have to cover these types of cost if you encourage them right\nBut that's if if you do not encourage them\nAnd you pass away you have your state is replenished with a return on your money's right\nSo let's return on investment right and and and so the money's not just wasted in and that's why I prefer life insurance over a over just straight long term care and most advisors going that way\nVery smart planning okay so we talked about a lot of that extends says that you would have in retirement ... late the sources of income how are we going to pay for that\nWell income can come from different places um Social Security most everyone has available to them or we mentioned earlier you might be lucky enough to have a pension yeah but if you have a pension through the state\nOr a municipality you're not getting Social Security right if you're listening money yeah you want to pay attention to that Scott windfall elimination provision mhm or wet and if you haven't heard of it go to ... dot Gov and\nLook into it and find make sure that you're not counting on three grand a month and pension and out of the two thousand a month and Social Security because now it's not likely happening then then you you know you might have a pension from a company or a or a union there you're getting both and that's great and you're going to be very well off and retirement [noise] but\nWe always want to identify going back to the first thing how much money you're going to be spending what's your income gap usually the pension and Social Security are not going to be enough to cover\nWhat that income need is and then we have to look at other resources which are going to come from your own savings retirement savings and otherwise and then we have to make sure and put a plan together or to a addressed\nHow that incomes going to be delivered to you and what best auctions and products are investments are going to go into a you know to utilize that\nAnd that's why it's important to have a professional take a lot because I wouldn't know what products are bass that uh you have a very wide knowledge of all of this crisis and that you know definitely can help people navigate\nBut just putting money into a mutual fund or Haiti or something like that with respect to generating that income is not a good idea certainly not the best idea and so there you know there are ways that you can sensibly invest\nYour money that will get you the income a user of guarantee it for the rest of your life of course everybody wants yeah and uh allow you to have a more carefree retirement because you're not worried about this one's coming in and you know that your income is always going to be covered no matter what\nAnd lastly and you know an important thing that you need to do before you retire ... view and a gesture state plan ... wells in trusts and beneficiaries\nDo you have a durable power of attorney a healthcare proxy maybe you're a should be have a trust me or how should be on a trust there are a lot of different things depending on your situation or you're going to have different needs and somebody else\nBut certainly should be addressed because it can cause you a lot of heartache you know in retirement when something happens to ... to one of you and can really cause an issue for your spouse yeah\nAh and certainly your heirs yes and I'm so definitely something you want to you know have in\nPlace I had a time and it's one of those things that the earlier you do the better off you're going to be I meet a lot of people and lean who said they've done this but they'll say well I've only did all will\nThirty or forty years ago well let me tell you some you need to go in and attorney now\nBecause a lot of what you try to accomplish back then is probably not going to be honored today because there's a lot of changes in the in laws yeah and uh just because you have a well from Thirty years ago may not have water now so definitely spend the money and the time to go visit with the estate planning attorney if you need one yeah please let me know and I can were free to a few that I Know in the south shore\nAnd isolate your your life situation\nHas changed could have changed a lot since then like we have four children that's the point two and a half\nHour like out of college so we still have you know one who's who's finishing up college and one who's just going to be starting next year so we wanted to make sure that the will adjust\nFor covering the college as a fourth child lately and then distributing the assets\nAfter that then paid for it because all the other ones have had their their education paid for sale we needed to make sure that that last one gets ... hopefully we will be around to pay for college but um you know we have to take that into consideration\nWe'll think of things that could change in forty years oh so your network yeah or your family dynamics whether you have more kids are from when you say well maybe you only had one child at the time or maybe grandkids lots of lots of things that could have changed in that timeframe and that's why you want to review it and maybe it's nothing that\nComes to mind that you're thinking up with an attorney is going to be able to point out to you or that something needs to be addressed\nExactly said this and many other reasons why I invite you to sit down with ... tape

review\nAll complimentary all you have to do this call psycho eight to one seven\nNine three six eight or go to Cape retirement radio dot com anytime for more information now of course we know you had your seminars a few weeks that can understand that you got a lot of really good questions like that they're real hot question that people were asking you about\nWell uh the topic of the seminar and ... we're talking about Social Security and Social Security is a less complicated than used to be yeah we're still able to add value with respect to how to plan for how to take it in all that so that was the main reason folks were there um but\nWhen they got my ear and they were asking questions they were really their concern was that you know the market itself and the uh the height of the market yeah there are very knowledgeable and focused on that where it's the longest bull market in history\nAs of what our August twenty sucking up this year\nAnd everybody says hey that they also say okay when is the other shoe to drop ...\nRight and you know you got to remember the audience is most everyone was fifth you know older yeah um and uh probably average age you know middle of low sixties and it was a concern to there's\nA the ah they're all concerned about you know keeping what they have they don't want to lose what is it the accumulated they've been very appreciative of the the ... and and the rise\nBut they also remember what happened in two thousand two thousand nine and I'm like I've been preaching all the time they realize they can't afford and other situation like that in losing those funds so the question was ah you know how to what do they do to protect\nA some of the things that they have in\nLike who mentioned on a year or I mean every shows you know\nMy group what we're doing his risk management that's the number one thing we're focusing on and so that's exactly what is we're focusing on which is reduce the amount of risk that you're taking in order to get the returns that you need in in that doesn't mean a you know let me just beat the market crash into martial move everything into cash or that's not\nThe way to do it right but there are certainly different things that you need to look at and I think for a lot of these folks in the room there on easy because they understand that ah their equity portfolios have grown much faster than there\nThan there are a fixed income promoters and so maybe they're out of whack a little bit and they have too much inequities now and they and they just don't know where to go what to do where to put the funds and I'm going to over with them\nThe not only the height of the market but also great interest in in in the interest rate risk going forward with rising interest rates those bon\nInvestments those conservative investments that you have are going to be a ... movie really difficult for them to make money and in fact that could lose money and so you might be going out of the frying pan into the fire so to speak leaving no yeah\nSo it gets very complex and when I meet with people explain this in great detail\nTo one seven nine three six eight ... to one seven\nNine three six eight or if you

... tape retirement radio dot com and Chris welcome good to see you\nAre you to Ireland and I'm sure you had a great fourth yeah we're talking about that so tell me about the weekend\n[laughter] it did so my husband had to work the fourth of July but then the Indy normally works weekends so then he had Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday off\nAnd it was like a trial run of retirement that's right and how to go to ... it was fabulous I didn't kill him\nWe are going to start it always good it's always good to know that your spouse will survive retirement with you um you know it was it was terrific but it was also a great opportunity to talk about what we see our retirement as\nYou know very good I think the great news and an Guardia that opportunity I mean people don't have that\nOption prior to retirement so they go ahead and uh just jumping in with two feet without any practice you need more practice is like that oh yeah Dr ... more taking more time off in practicing a little bit more [laughter] it'd be better\nServed retirement well we have a great show on tap today which will help people get that great retirement\nA critic is going to be talking about things like um comparing retirement of retirement with a plan versus a retirement without a plan and we'll be looking at saving spending income protection and so much more ... ah\nFirst stuff good idea or a bad idea to go into retirement without a plan\nWell of course I'm a planner ally ...\nThe statistics and I don't have them off the top of my head here but the success rate for something somebody who has a plan versus someone who doesn't it's amazing the difference and so definitely a proponent\nFor having a written planned down and that's something I Do for all of my clients and certainly are some everyone should have is complimentary when I offer that retirement\nExposure review we're putting a plan together for you I'm\nActually looking at what your current plan as well you know you have one or not but just seeing what you're doing and then comparing it to an actual plan with maybe a couple of changes which we might make and see how how they compare hopefully I'm able to better you're\nA outcome or by making those changes but the whole idea is by having that plan something go to and review every year on the annual basis to make sure you're on track\nAnd that's that's the key with the plan is to see where you're at are you a head of the game behind her behind and are being able to make the judgments on the fly\nThe more time you have to make those adjustments the better off you're going to be but without the plane and you don't need to you don't know if you need to make any judgments or not and that's the key and we're the plan really comes in\nSo my four oh one K. isn't my plan I think you know a lot of people look and say well of course and planning for retirement I have a ... hey\nOh four one K. is a great savings account or your retirement I mean that's what it's for but it it's it itself is not a plan\nOr you have to look at ... ... how much you're saving how it's invested ...\nWhat the expected rate of return on that account is going to be and then how you convert that to income along with all the other resources you're going to have outside of that for all and K plan such as Social Security maybe have a pension so and so forth so these are all things that are plan will take a look at when determining your probability of success throughout retirement\nOkay so we've determined we need to plan more than just star four O. one K. and that plan is going to take a look at what you have for savings\n... it's not only your savings or when we look at a higher invested yeah so you might have your ... okay but you have other accounts maybe older four one K. is higher raise or other things that would be doing you've been doing [noise]\nHow ... how are they you know looking at everything that you have and how they're invested you know how does one work with the other a lot of people it's ... it's very dysfunctional or it's almost like it's two totally separate hangs with two separate goals\nKind of like a dysfunctional Sam right so you end up as odd relatives that you really need to bring into the fold\nAll right so you want to make sure that your balance and everything's directed\nInvested for that goal that common goal of environment or we're nearing retirement you know most people are not comfortable watching their money go down now you know and have fluctuates in the market uh your fluctuations in the markets so uh you know if you're not comfortable having your savings\nReduce urine and you're out with your your spending and then with market losses you really need to take a look at how everything's working in conjunction with one another\nYou mentioned spending and that's also one of the\nThe things we want to talk about and and they do something that you have to get into a mindset because\nFor your whole working life you've been saving saving saving and then you flip a switch to retirement which you know it was nice practicing being retired but yeah we were going out to dinner we were spending money and all this stuff you you flip that switch and you're spending instead of\nSaving your your your your spending what you've saved\nWell with respect to spending and I this is obviously part of it I Want to know when you come in\nA part of your my intake with you is to find out how much you're spending\nYou know and you know most people honestly they don't know now uh they know that ... comes in and she goes out but they don't really know what they're spending I met with a couple of the other day and a God Bless them they came in and filled out that worksheet yes and they were\nWhen they had never done it before they couldn't they said it was painful but enlightening because they saw what they were spending on things they may\nNot need to spend on and uh but it got to give them a great idea of how much they're spending a month\nAnd whether they had a short Florida and with that information I can put that income plan together for you to make sure that you have enough money that's going to last a lifetime uncover all those expenses at you\nAnd that works she is part of your free um offer where people can come in and sit down with you and it's part of making that plane\nRight and you know the the spending aspect of it that's creating income and so when we put a plan in place where you have a policy in place\nThe auction with those you know plans and the the policy is to generate the income that you're going to need in my whole idea with you is that I Want to make sure you're guaranteed lifetime stream of income you cannot outlive you know the idea is if I'm covering your\nBasic living expenses and you can balance a checkbook you're going to be very stress free retirement\nThat was our next a check on the list income I'm so that is possible to be able to um have that life long life signing them have ...\nI mean look at the lifetime terms of income people do have you know we'd have Social Security right and for most everyone out their Social Security and just not going to cut it on its own right um for some people it does I don't know how to put for for Ninety\nPercent of us this is not going to cut it some people have a pension if they're really lucky and if they have a pension law temp that between that and Social Security\nThey make covers the among may may cover anything for a for most of it then you have other retirement money is that you can use in put it into products\nThat will generate guaranteed lifetime streams of of income that you can't outlive\nAnd so when you have that money coming in you know comes in on a monthly basis and your your expenses are five grand a month and you have six or seven coming in\nOn top of that right ah and you're actually have a little extra every month to feel pretty good about yourself and again it's a very simple to do or you just have to come in and see me I can show you how to work for you\nAnd there are products out there and you being a seduced Sherry you\nYou pay you help people pick the right product for them something that is good for me might not be good for someone else I'm the risk involved are all those kinds of things you take into consideration before you you know plot outlet what folks should um\nAnd seen it see how this is all going to play out right and uh taking a look at all your resources\nYou are setting yourself up for a potential massive failure in you know I'm Sorry we're near sixty or fifty five you don't have time to make it back up again uh this is the one time you cannot make a mistake and that's where I come in and that's why I Do what I Do\nWork so many years you want to enjoy your retirement so I Know that you recently had a a workshop and you've got great\nResponse but I did um one place like the most the most important\nTo her that the most concerning thing because I Know you talked to a lot of people\nI personally afterwards and what would they most worried about\nWell the the summer uh initially we talked about\nA Social Security right and people you know it's it's fairly simple do but people a lot of questions about it so we were fighting a handful of things with Social Security everyone had their own everyone's different that's another thing everybody has a different situation so are they all different questions about Social Security which I address but they don't want it to\nYou know the three things that I think are probably the most\nDangerous things for folks who were about to retire\nOr now a one of them is a you know we just talk talk about the market and they talk about a little later on the show and how high it isn't timing yet another one is interest rates are low they are and how that's going to affect you I mean retirees in the past never in history has anybody\nRun into these issues at the same time and so it's almost like a perfect storm in a bad way and the third thing what you want to talk about a little bit is health care the cost of healthcare\nIs outrageous right now for daily investments are when they're less study from uh last year two thousand Seventeen if you're retiring a retired couple is sixty five you can expect to pay out of pocket\nSo after insurance coverage right two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars draw your return it's apt in Medicare that's correct after that so\nYou know this isn't expenses paid by Medicare and this is out of your own pocket coming out of your retirement accounts or to whatever it is two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars I got to be honest Eileen I meet people who were fifty five or sixty haven't even see that I'm Out yeah\nAnd so when you look at that it is a major issue\nThe reason is obviously healthcare has gone out of control or the cost of it yet and longevity is another thing I mean you have to plan for a living\nOr a long life I mean if you're a married couple of sixty five you have a better than ten percent chance of one of views gonna live past the age of Ninety yeah and you know Twenty years ago you didn't think that way but now it's a common\nOccurrence and it's getting longer and longer\nAnd we want to we want to stay healthy we want to stay happy and and have a good long retirement see those grandchildren and perhaps even those great grandchildren so um you know we we see that the market\nIs up the economy is strong people on average have more money in their retirement account than ever before\nWhat biggest hidden expense would it be paying for health\nCare it is harder it is healthcare because that's one thing people can get their arms around I as an advisor have a hard time because we don't know we can see what it is today but it's hard to forecast what it's going to be next year right like I said there needs to be some government intervention in saying that but\nThere has to be something done about it to curtail those costs otherwise our nation will get bankrupt so I think it will be one of those things is on the agenda and the next four to six years or to to rectify but it is a major problem\nBecause I sit there and I think about you know what will be our big bills in retirement and of course I put travel AS number one but you know housing and you know if you have to\nYou know six making major repair to a whole you know buy a new car but that's nothing compared to health care costs\nIt really it really is not I mean I mean are you going to spend two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and traveling in retirement no very unlikely highly unlikely I Would really\nLike to because then I'll be flying first class you know like you\nKnow you could you could take a vacation every year for\nThree weeks a couple of weeks and fly first class is still never close to Seventy five during your retirement so it is a big concern in the uh ... the biggest concern or the thing that I see so now he's been doing this research on this for a handful of years\nAnd it goes up every year you know ten grand Fifteen grand I mean we look five years ago was probably like two hundred and thirty thousand\nIt's going up and up and up and that's why it needs to be addressed and\nThe people after seminar what was their reaction when you told them that figure two hundred Seventy five thousand dollars worth of healthcare costs out of pocket after Medicare\nUh moans and groans news really what I heard a lot among the grounds and people are a little bit in disbelief uh and uh they want to know how to combat that and there are certain things that we can do in sooner I see the better off you'll be as far as trying to address that issue\nSo there are things that you can um tools that people can use 'em plans um maybe funds that they can put money into so that it'll help them with these ...\nSure one of one of the costs associated with that is going to be you know potentially nursing abduction you wish and and um and so we can leverage money that you have now are and and\nYou multiply it so if you have a hundred thousand we could get your benefit of maybe a half a million dollars with that without a hundred thousand in case something like that happened in that way you've leverage an asset so you don't have to Seventy five hundred is\nFive hundred thousand thousand potentially in case of those cars so it's a great way to uh to plan for some of these expenses but you need to know about it in advance\nExactly and the best thing is to sit down with Chris and talk about these things so if you weren't able to go to the workshop um don't worry and he doesn't have another one scheduled for a little while but um you can get one better than that
