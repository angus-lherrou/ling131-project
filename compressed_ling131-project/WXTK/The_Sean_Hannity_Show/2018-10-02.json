News John shook seabird some responding\nTo pressure from Democrats and moderate Republicans the White House has now ease limitations on the FBI background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sources still ABC News that the FBI can interview anyone at once with a focus on sexual misconduct claims\nEssentially she should have said listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings\nWe had two months no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say go ahead\nAnd actually this week at Mr President you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat does it have to do is like I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is kind of ... and I know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever tried to enter trait yellow paths or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of uh\nThe real turn it is but I Do think so I think if they're fair which is a big questions I have a ceremony sides are Republicans love it\nOr industrial opposite our country loves it or if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing us auto free telephone number you want to be a part of the\nProgram well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators oh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge\nBrett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last\nWeek if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI had\nTo do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor Ford that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt is this now uh we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been inaccurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it as character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe something while he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goal post now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with\nTraditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge cow this is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassinate me or cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me it would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example though you're getting Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying\nAbout having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than plainly state it\nIs that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I the reason I brought that up on his I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at ... at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promise last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nWhen you are but the point is I think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever oh not that we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the ... in history of the left if they can do it to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son I mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total wire total fabrication\nBut what if you're not if\nWhat if your child is her what if you're in somebody else's ... if you if you own a home your property and you've got kids driving around in their

watching those types of shows and doing the things that people want a mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one for social work conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power\nTo investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witness was being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits\nThere's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the problem is we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think you look if

now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably were\nI'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that's fine you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that at every Democrat that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets ... and many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times they've found now they've indicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I but\nI Wonder if the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the ... in the bureau special agents have all said Jimmy never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave instructing page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know what those soul to the earth people and I said out of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the FBI I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd if you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company's coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and his mother another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nWhat the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as ... as well make that can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individual ... that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my protection\nUnder that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted to\nView over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a single one to corroborate a story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted a former yell classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asked for the other ... she telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThe whole um ... most recent face exploded I think with the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even sure it with him he said what part that he was in the room [laughter]\nYou know a positive he adjusted hands but everything they do it but I but I Can't take her start getting hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I track there even if they cut about ... you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nAnd they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people out there\nAnd I got older I get a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said in

choice you made with respect to what happened in the White House we just didn't believe I didn't believe the mistake for myself that it was an impeachable offense that's the issue and and uh what about Ted Kennedy\nOf this similarly people have been critical for the areas where he was critical of himself he stood up and own moments where he knew have stepped over the line so I think that\nThat
