sources for us the Irish [noise] All right but for every loose thanks for being with us you know come back we're going to talk with Jessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies\nBack to the uh back to the invasion in our car [noise]\nGay news radio Ninety five WICK\nLove vocal Matthews brothers [noise]\nA poor poor five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number about how we car show up to like to join us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon as you know a a\nA big rut mob is winding its way through Mexico headed for the U.S border and the\nPresident Donald Trump has said he's going to stop them today he uh I guess I don't know if people said this in March before you on the plane to Houston or a ... to ... he challenged the uh\nThe media to take the cameras inside the caravan and see if they can find some gang bangers some MS Thirteen members or some middle Easterners because again we know we know a lot of MS Thirteen gang bangers got in through the last the surge\nOf unaccompanied children the Texas a public safety department has a has documented\nAnd we know that a lot of um mid eastern ... potential terrorists have been arrested recently in Guatemala was in the major newspaper down there the president of the country announced it\nSo joining us now on the line is uh just go on from the center for Immigration Studies and we just wanted to ask her\n... what the what should the president do next how can how can we stop this a mob but this this mob particularly before the midterms in and all these future mobs from a breaking into the country and invading it didn't trying to fundamentally transform it is a block Obama cheered them on\nWhat you do\nWell there are a number of things he could do he's been leaning on these other governments to enforce their own immigration laws that should help but you know we can't wait for other countries to on you know save us from caravan so we have to take steps in cases like this one of the options he had just to simply\nClose the border it's an extreme\nOption but you know if I Am a mob of four thousand people is hell bent on\nTesting our sovereignty that's what we're gonna have to do it and it can be done and then you know sure it hurts business for some people but it hurts our communities and the rest of the country where these people are struggling not to stop them so that's one option the other thing is is it in and started that would be simply\nTelling these people know you don't get to apply for asylum here because you come right through thousands per thousand miles through a safe country that has offered you asylum so you have no basis for making that claim here\nUm the other thing is that we simply could I you know just put a really a house hold the line with the help of military an additional border patrol agents from other places\nHow 'bout how 'bout uh been suggested this all day I read it on power line blog dot com\nWhy don't the under the U.S constitution the president has the power in the case of a rebellion or an invasion to was suspend habeas corpus I due process I mean ... and just declare basically a state of national emergency because of an invasion I mean this is an invasion is it not\nWell it sure feels like one when you have people waving the Honduran flag and scrambling to barricades I you know between Guatemala and Mexico\nAnd looting ... looting grocery stores on their way north I mean these are not people who were going to claiming to contribute anything to the U.S economy obviously they're criminals\nRight well many of them are and certainly entering illegally would be a crime and the president does have the authority under the constitution player that any aliens that he feels a would be a threat to the United states\nFrom anywhere can be barred entry just like with the travel ban at the same um statutory basis as the travel ban which of course has now been held out\nIn court approved by the Supreme Court\nDoes that and authority he had and that would be the basis for simply shutting down the places where these people will try to enter a and the president also has the authority in crisis Judy ... state and local law enforcement agencies and I have a feeling that Texas it would be quite happy to\nUm help with its resources because they've been doing it for years now already at their own expense\nGot into a big Texas will be hard to Texas has been moving the national guard down I heard the lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick on another show earlier today saying that they were moving troops into position but I mean I don't think that they have the same powers that are that are the regular army or the border patrol what have you know\nThat's right only the border patrol can make immigration arrests but we don't you don't actually want to make any uh where\nDo we want to keep them out and throw Humphrey we don't we don't want them to that's the thing about suspending hey be us corpus I mean that way you can keep the these these gang of immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from a ... you know ... you're the one to adjust ... says the or the process isn't all the appeals process isn't over until the alien wins and it's so true we gotta keep 'em on the other anyway we gotta keep 'em on the other side of the border\nYou know to prevent them from getting inside because once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nFor the rest of their lives in our no question about it once once people get and it came over I'm just and the problem is it's it's just what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got it\nAnd I'm surprised it took so long for another one to form on so that's why we need really term and forceful measures now and\nWe can explain it to the New York times later\nWhy don't you tell us I how many what percentage of the illegal aliens from Central America up on welfare\nAccording to the Obama administration's own statistics which I've seen Breitbart\nAnd you know I don't I don't know that I have my head but we do know from our research that about half of all immigrant headed households are accessing well at welfare programs and that's legal and illegal\nSo you know and while illegal aliens don't always have direct access to welfare programs if they have a child here with a U.S citizen through birthright citizenship then that child becomes eligible for a lot of benefits and the parents benefits through that\nAnd of course if you're having a a a child here that's covered as a form of emergency healthcare that we pick up the tab for so and I you know not to mention schooling and and other things I mean\nDoes it at a a family detention center a today in Pennsylvania and saw that the places where each family units have been coming for the last few years are kept until they're released and it's something like seven hundred and fifty dollars a day\nFor each person who's in one of these centers\nThat they're getting a health care schooling recreation they go on a field trip every week food clothing shelter and then you know a relief to go work wherever they want live wherever they want never to be seen again most\nSo it's like to get a ... once you get at once you get across the border it's like you're on a you've got a lifetime vacation you won the lottery I mean all of us were standing in line trying to to win the lottery and these people altogether\nYes yeah I think\nBecause you have such a high base rate on that uh and you said that this isn't a tax privilege to count which means you're not even paying taxes at this time\nI think I Would hold on I think I in that particular case remember you have something with a high base rate this not currently available I think I Would hold on to the\nMoney talks come your way each and every weekend talking about subjects financial let's get down to the mighty WLS Chicago John it's your turn welcome\nHi, Bob I really appreciate taking my call out about this as fast as I can cause I Know your time is precious [noise] ah my IRA is fully funded one hundred percent in the vanguard twenty twenty target date fund\nAnd so is my wife and her and her work her four oh one K. is funded and what they call the vanguard twenty twenty trust fund\nWhich is exactly the same product as the uh twenty twenty target date fund and our IRAs the only difference is\nThe twenty twenty target date fund in our air IRAs is about thirty two bucks a share and her four oh one K. find it's about fifty five dollars a share so I was wondering um does that make sense for her to do a service roll over\nTo hurt a higher rate in order to get more bang for her book or almost double the amount of shares\nJohn I'm really glad you called but I I really have to ask you what\nIn the world are we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in your comments that these two funds although they have a different share price they are identical in terms of what they own is that correct that is correct\nAll right well therefore tell me if I'm wrong\nIf the assets in that particular uh holding\nGo up a hundred percent the way I see it the thirty two dollars shares will be sixty four which is a double and the fifty five dollar shares will be one hundred ten which is a double you tell me if you think I'm wrong\nYou know I don't think you're wrong\nWell then there is no difference between them in terms of which one you own because either way you're going to make the exact same percentage which is the only thing that matters\nOkay I was just thinking that if you're if you're investing a hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollar per share side of it and and fifty five dollars per share your you're able to buy double the amount of shares in my thinking incorrect here\nMy opinion a yes or you're all caught off you're caught off base and tagged out for all in the stadium to see and I'll tell you why I say that and as you make your way as you make your way back to the dugout I'll tell you why I say that\nBecause if you put one and you tell me if you think I'm wrong [noise]\nUm if you put one hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollars shares and holdings in those shares double the securities and represented by those shares double than that one hundred thousand will be worth two hundred thousand and\nAt the same time and the other fund which has invested identically those that by those shares at fifty five will have one hundred ten dollars shares which means they're one hundred thousand dollars will also have doubled the two hundred thousand dollars we're talking apples and Apple's\nOkay I I really appreciate that can I ask you one follow up question\nIrish we recently moved all the fun all this all our IRA money\nAnd her four oh one K. money from a very diversified a plan to these target date funds because we want to retire in three years\nSo we wanted to reduce our risk in the market and get a bigger exposure to bonds\nAnd the the ratio and no shares are about fifty five percent stocks forty five percent bonds and we figured we do that for the next three years until I retire and then maybe evaluate our situation at that point may be going to manage payout fund or something different\nOr do you have any problem with that new allocation\nGoing to a fifty five forty five allocation anticipating a retirement situation as early as three years from\nNow is not something that would cause me a problem and John I Do appreciate the call always great to hear\nFrom our listeners and the windy city and throughout the mid west on the mighty WLS radio\nAnd for those of you that are just tuning in for the first time one of the things we like to encourage is that you saved from your earnings as you go down you are a hurting ... career and we tried to set a minimum if you can afford it of ten percent of your earnings\nNow a good way to do this of course is by taking advantage of your company plan\nA four O. one K. O. for three or four fifty seven [noise]\nUm if you don't have one of those you could use an IRA account but to try to save a minimum of ten percent of your income more if you can of course so that

seven nine three six eight that's five oh eight to one seven\nNine three six eight or visit Kay protect met radio dot com and Chris ... a lot about life insurance and um\nWe we had our we've reported that very few Americans are prepared or saved enough for retirement if your retirement plan is not fully funded what are the options of life insurance policy can offer\n[noise] well the limited I'll Try to do the best I can hear a\nSo people use life insurance for retirement planning on two fronts one if you're young and you have a family you have the you know have a mortgage you have an ... an insurance the writing so um so you buy life insurance maybe buy term but\nUh you can buy it cash value policy so you have a death benefit that is going to cover that need\nOr that you have at the moment\nBut you'll over funding it you're putting more into it yeah or as a savings account and trust me you're making a lot more in there then you are at the back yeah a lot\nAnd the nice thing about this cash value a balance as it's growing\nYou can access it tax free\nOr if you need that so I can take money out I mean I pay tax write and in a ... just the way it's a business or a dealer alone with the insurance company you know it's very hard to explain on the air [laughter]\nBut uh it's it's allowing you to maximize lost some insurance to make it the most tax efficient thing that you can do\nAnd if you don't use your money meaning you you don't use that extra cash value when you go to retire because you've been putting money raised this train to go to retire you're sixty five you could pull out in borrow against it and create a tax free income stream\nFor your lifetime wow and in doing so what happens is uh you know it's ... ... rock distributions of tax free reverse mortgages or tax rate all of those things will be the only three things that will not affect taxes on your Social Security\nSo if you have Iraq Iran a policy like this that's how I have my plan but I'm\n... my Social Security for my wife and I will never be taxed\nI don't care what the factories are when uh when I retire or how they change it who's in control the government it doesn't matter\nNo man I Am going to be not affected at all because I Know what I have yeah in a fascinating it's a you know not always widely publicized but it's a great great great powerful tool and ah if something every once you take a look at\nAnd this is something that you could set up for people I Do it all the time all the time all the time it's just it's you know it's got to be the right situation for somebody but everybody needs life insurance to a degree in and put something that's affordable to you you can take advantage of one of these types of policies cool\nAll right well I'm sure a lot of our listeners

the the wealthiest of the wealthy this is how they do it this is part enough yeah I think about it why why do you want to leave your money in a bank right right even running in a bank to uh you know or or or borrow from the bank\nOr you know your ... your if you leave your money in the bank to pay nothing if you borrow money from the bank\nAnd you're in a yeah\nIf you can just saving a life insurance policy have gross that is without risk I mean but if you use the proper policy or getting decent rates of return all on that money versus what you're not getting the bank and then when you need the money to pay for college to ah\nMaybe biased a down payment or buy a second home more as I talked about earlier beginning income for retirement or the money\nIs there for you at a rate that is going to be basically much lower as the math works out than what a bank's going to do for you and your borrowing basically against your yourself so it's you know personal family banking isn't what it is right\nThat's why the wealthy remain round the [laughter] in in the meantime I mean uh you know unfortunately I I I uh\nUh came across somebody that I saw at the gym you know for a while and uh

invest in New today a when you miss the red hot stock market no\nNot necessarily a what you're actually doing depending on what type of nudity or if you if you buy a variable annuity you're in the market uh specifically so you can participate in the market mhm\nHowever the verbal annuities as I talk to you about before or on the air no you specifically to use the public ... they're very expensive so you probably won't participate as much as you would have had you just done it\nOn your own and the other thing to note\nIs with the added expense in those verbal annuities you're also not protecting yourself so the red hot stock market's going to go up but then eventually it's going to come down so if you went into a verbal annuity that's what's likely going to happen you're going to pay extra in fees you'll\nGrow no market keeps going up but uh certainly it'll fall as well so\nUm other types of annuities index annuities which I talk about a lot and I prefer a wall of you know a million miles over a variable annuities the index annuities you can participate in the market gains without its losses so\nProbably won't be as much as the market and they're not designed to do that but you also have that protection and I think it's extremely prudent especially right now with as high as the market is\nYeah yeah risk management I hear you say that all the time okay Robert from Brewster is it too late to add an annuity to an existing retirement\nI Would say not necessarily a again I don't know I'm Robert your situation everyone's different and that's really important to note because ever when it comes to see me comes with a very different set of circumstances are different resources and so on and so forth but the depending on what you're trying to accomplish if you're trying to accomplish you know maximizing your income\nAnd your you know in retirement or or getting close to retirement it's an excellent opportunity to do that so uh it's not too late to add in the new ... I you know I was done annuities for folks uh recently who were in their eighties wow you know working with somebody right now are in Florida who's eighty five\nAnd I'm looking to to put all of a large sum in there so it just depends on what your you know are trying to accomplish and there's really no age limitation so much\nAnd that's why it's good to speak with you a ... of ... financial professional because that person can ask the right questions to decide what is right for each individual person\nNot not only that but I've been doing this a long time twenty five plus your mom also note and point out the questions you should have asked that you didn't\nYep so I'm you know again as I get to know you better although more of the things that are going to be important to you and so people come see me and they ask great question generally do what they don't always us all the right one so on and make sure you know everything the good and the bad about whatever it is you're about to enter into\nAwesome All right we have one from Plymouth and he asks if I have a variable annuity can I switch it to affect my favorite question favorite question\nWell if you love to talk of the uh the list of your uh ... absolutely I offer a I'm a review of your annuity it's called the newest stressed out so you have the variable annuity out there\nAre so one got a call me yeah bringing Lenny review it for you know costs are obligations to you know but it's just an opportunity for you to understand what it is that you on how much is costing you and what the benefits are going to be from that policy\nIn one I'm able to show you is there are three\nNinety nine percent of the time much better ways where you can get out of that variable annuity and accomplish what it is you're you're to accomplish with a lot less cost yep without the risk associated with the variable annuity so and so forth there is just so many reasons to get out of the variable annuity a no matter who you are but I I don't care [laughter]\nI don't care or if you bought it two years ago or Twenty years ago police come and see me I Will show you a better way I promise\nAll right and I want to just come from that's a complementary evaluation annuity stress tests and no obligation you'll give them their answers right then and there\nWell it takes to I Will give you their answers but it takes a lot of work behind him to do that you'll come in and gave me the information and then I'll go and do the work and have you come back into review it but uh yeah there is there's some work that window is what I Would say with this subject now\nI Know people take advantage of this offer and I'll tell you it's mind boggling to me because people have serious money in these products five hundred thousand a million if I could see the two percent\nThat's a lot of my other three percent or on a million dollars yeah I wouldn't you take the time and I know you have them out there if you are listening if you're ... if you work with a broker at one of these major firms out there it is being sold to you and I'm sure you have a retirement account is probably it's him\nAnd uh I don't care how much elected broker could be your best pal yet but uh they should be shown you something different and that's the challenge I have come and see me and let me just take a look at it the second set of eyes yeah there's no obligation just so that you know for your own\nPersonal you know not being and then you can go to your ... your advisor and talk to them about if you'd like\nGreat All right we have a Carol from down there and she asks can I keep my four oh one K. and the market and still be protected yes and no yes and no\nWell this is a loaded question [laughter] typically ... well when your money singer for\nOkay you're limited to the choices that you have ... you know Fifteen mutual funds whatever it is a if you're going to maintain being in the marketing of ... um\nYou know you're not necessarily protected because you're going to go and the ups and downs and market of course you could sell in and put yourself into things like you know a short term bond fund or a money market that's offered to senior for okay therefore you're out of the market but you're not earning anything of course but it's a safe haven but I got one better for you okay\nI offer wealth guard wealth guard is a portfolio monitoring system and I know a lot of folks don't look at their ... day in and day out and they do worry about being in the market they ... they like to see it grow yeah but they are cognizant that out there are the markets high\nAnd if you're not you should be but uh in they don't want to see their portfolio down like it did in a way you know nine in and before that two thousand two thousand three and we could go back in history has done time and time again\nSo with wealth guard it's something that I offered to my clients\nAre as you know part of our relationship\nWith respect to our our money management now in wealth guard on in my group a ... you know we will sell out if you hit your wealth card number and real quickly to explain what that is if you have a million dollars in your four O. one K. and your wealth card number based on your risk tolerance is ten percent\nPut that you know uh all your eggs in one basket with the work policy because that is um although it's not a of a bad thing it's certainly not the way to go on to talk about life insurance\nAnd any of us and I would say all of us have had that where you switched jobs or maybe you lost her job so you don't have\nYou know any other life insurance except for what your employer was getting so then you have to start from scratch and go through that health checks and all of that for this life insurance\nSeparately whereas if you just did it in the beginning got it done and then it didn't matter wouldn't matter if you change jobs are retired air did any of\nThis on a and this is personal experience as happened a long time ago about six years ago I have a client her husband was state police mhm okay\nI retired at fifty good and you know ... and a against my plant by advice what he did was he a he said okay I'm going to retire fifty I'm going to take my full pension window survivorship benefits that are going to my life insurance\nYou know that some of the extra premiums are punching I'm getting yeah to cover my my spouse that is a great idea but here's this mistake he had insurance through you know union or this aren't just through work she didn't apply or even bother to do anything until after he retired\nSix weeks after he retired he died of cancer oh my gosh you didn't know at the time and when he went to go apply for insurance that's when he found it\nSo\nThis this and I'm not making this up does happen so here it is a a wife in her forties with kids okay and and know lost the pension because he took off to the no ... no life insurance I mean this is serious serious business\nWow and it's not just about\nYou it's about the family it's about your spouse it's about your children it's about being able to provide for them after a just in case in that instance something like this happens that you are just not prepared for right wow that really is that's earth earth shattering earth shaking\nOr get your tissues and um yeah I Know really I I get a yeah man upsetting as a was one of those things are really\nYou know I just destroyed or a family that lost their home I mean it goes on and on\nYeah definitely did too bad I hate to say it to Betty didn't listen to you and and and you know\nProtect against that but for folks who are I'm thinking in Maine are you definitely want to sit down with Chris and talked to him and find out what will be best for you not only you but your spouse and your children\nOkay well you know what ... you mentioned earlier that you were talking to a woman at the gym and um our listeners\nBecause this is radio not TV listeners can't see\nBut you have the brightest yellow sneakers on today [laughter] you know Jim ... and ... and this is this just always reminds me that you know we're taking better care of ourselves\nWe're living longer and we really do need to be prepared for a longer retirement and that means having the funds\nTo fund it I mean ah of course you know stay in shape is important to me of course I Would like to live as long as I can to to to get into the nineties yeah and um so my wife and I have a you know we have a you know a\nCompetition who's gonna live long [laughter] so he's right now she couldn't come but right now he's winning because she's at the gym more often than I had a aside some catching up to do but at the end of the day\nYou're right people are being uh I just look at my gym I mean it is a it's a lifestyle now you know Fifteen Twenty years ago the there wasn't as many gyms as there are now him it wasn't part of everyone's life style the way it is now and so that just adds to what you're saying is it it's\nFurther evidence so we're going to be living longer lives but it's not just longer healthier and active yes in healthy or an actor what does that mean that means you're taking trips you're spending money you're going to be any more money uh to to enjoy yourself in those later years hacker when I go uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity
