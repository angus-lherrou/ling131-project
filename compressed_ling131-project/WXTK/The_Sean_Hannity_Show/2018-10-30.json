shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um

key races now in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and Ron dissenters\nA couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett us and we have British ... team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers for Brett us in calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like Brett as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera toss a we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat\nAnd only the only factor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat\nHeld her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend

saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join

hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had an midterm election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats are two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are a vice to people right now certainly uh

that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special\nConsideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole\nColumn yet but what if my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question but on the Mark I'm in the ... actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of the president who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitution and making ... presidents for life here in bed with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us ... does not seem to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get in the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married and lives I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true but most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to get them I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know

potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of\nCommissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nYou say the shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every quarter of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue is to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it\nOpen borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like you know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticent staff calling the people at Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case if Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president we have the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterms think about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease it regularly watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent goes to talk about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to ... some people in November six\nThe mailroom manager loves a fast

and check\nWhen I was at the post office to register this poor girl clearly also a college student like me didn't know what post marks\nAnd then I had no idea how to send an important documents by mail most people my age have zero need to go to the post office and they have never stepped into one before honestly if someone had just had the forms printed for me and was willing to deal with the post office I'd be much more inclined to\nWhen I was in college I think my parents were fearful of that I Would take that route as as that girl from the last segment said ... I'm not doing this to my mom would call me on a daily basis and say I got uniforms please vote did you vote yet are you voting\nSee they actually they they made a really easy at boat and they actually set up a the Brunswick town clerk actually set up a polling place in the union\nSo you if you were walking through like anywhere on campus they made it so easy to vote and it was always so pissed off about it because I knew exactly how all of them were voting and you'd have these ... out of state college students all in a line in the college Democrats are walking up to up and down the line than a vote no on one yes on to yes on three no on four\nAnd they're saying yes to all these bond initiatives like hey you guys are college students like a get it\nYou're hoping changing you want to go vote for Barack Obama you want to vote for gay marriage like I get that but don't vote on the bond issues do you're not you're not sticking around to pay off the bond issues like these these are my people that you're settling with all this debt for some environmental project or some water projects some union handout but don't don't vote on the bond issues but\nI think a good amount of millennials vote for the stamp yeah I voted stamp and then they put it on social media\n... you are going to get to this last one Jocelyn grace refused to read it because she thought that it would be unfair this is a Jocelyn from Arlington, Massachusetts on why she's not going to vote it was easier to get my medical marijuana card no right or even federally legal than it was to register to vote Massachusetts had online registration but only if you have a DMV issued I date\nI don't drive so I was like okay I can register in person but I'm also dealing with a chronic illness every\nDay's a guessing game am I going to fill up to doing it today I put it on the week before the deadline ended up being really sick and I wasn't able to leave home you can send in your registration by mail but I didn't have\nTo get as far as I'm concerned how we'll be back tomorrow at three [laughter]\nStock market volatility make you scared or nervous well instead of panicking start to plan how many how many damn good been certified financial planner and BPA for a workshop and financial planning on November fifteenth anytime for details call one eight hundred two six seven sixty five hundred that one eight hundred six seven sixty five\nHundred and remember don't panic plant\nSecurity offered to el ... financial number ... ... and that's going to bite off a few good men advisory group Elsie a registered independent by their separate from L.

Gina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff just one you think it\nGet worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects Schumer then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was\nBut on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else I remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called paws ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to bring the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nYear before the twenty fourteen midterms a media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the GOP claim they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nSean Hannity show [noise]\n\nAll right we're talking to bill Stoller CEO chairman of the board of express employment professionals so what can businesses expect in today's hiring market which has changed a lot in the last two years\nWill show this spring was the first time in nearly Twenty years at the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people with this we're seeing some creative benefits being offered to alert top talent\nAnd what can job seekers look for in this market\nWhere we did a survey of our franchise owners and found the top for ... and attracting and retaining workers were wages in bonuses naturally family benefits education and training in workplace culture\nWhat about business owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises and sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business versus having employees seek advancement opportunities elsewhere and this could mean offering training and educational system it's not just for the job there isn't but for a future crew auction\nI make sense invest in your workforce and they'll invest in your business\nThat trade Sean in an investment isn't always financial from a simple insincere thank you to a recognition program to celebrate employees now is the time to express

one week from today the results come in but I just going back to Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen is what Nate Silver is five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much of Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty seats and keep their majority Democrats can also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls\nJohn Kerry was going to be president because of the polls\nNow I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard\nAnd the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now that you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen and your district\nCheck out my website the if you're in one of those key pivotal tip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ...\nIf you vote for a Republican and if you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall and I will be a vote for any democratic senator you're just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for Bredesen McCaskill Nelson\n...
