{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "Let's go for something that will hit everyone's pocketbook\nWhen in this room to board a real was put together to busloads of groups that went up to Boston in over for no five and then marched trying to open up\nThe insurance commissions policies on residential housing insurance and on auto insurance\nFor lobbyists have a day when they're talking about insurance health insurance insurance have a day when they're talking about it but when it comes to home insurance and when it comes to auto insurance commissioner doesn't even open a public accounting for the process what are you to come into those same this community some money\nGreat question that'll be great question this so this is I I gave\nHer running list of um a policy wonk and so I have a lot of ideas you you can ask my staff I'm always saying hey let's look at that looked like about\nOne thing that I feel I haven't been able to get my hands around yet is the real cost of homeowners insurance that we have here um and that really actually with a constituent right in on me about a month ago about this challenging issue a and and my staff and I were going back and forth\nWith the insurance commissioner has just wasn't getting the answer but I Want it on the short answer is I don't know I'd love to sit down with you I'd love to sit down with Brian Castle and the ... and ... and begin to try to figure this out\nUm it's a big challenge the piece that I had been focused on Jim and you and I worked on this and sat down on this um is a is not waste water ah which you know as I mentioned earlier we've got four billion dollar price tag for waste water here\nUm you know my plan is a billion dollars from the state uh which is going to mean real savings for property tax payers is going to be a real boost\nIn the arm to projects like Dennis in origin Yarmuth are working on now with her clean water coalition um you know so I'm I'm really proud of that I Want to make sure we get that over the finish line\nUm but you know you're giving me some real food for thought I think this might be a next big thing to work on and I really love to rely on you you know your wisdom and advice and others I think it's a great question I think something we used to work on so thank you for asking\nThat question John just a just a follow up a counselor Crocker and I have that many discussions about this or over the past year relative to how uh insurance rates are ... and how insurance rates of driven as well as how strong the insurance lobby group is up on the hill\nUh there's no doubt about it that the homeowner's insurance on the auto auto insurance should be open up on a regular basis so competitive that should be public hearings held for whatever given reasonable legislature has not demanded that\nI'm probably one of the strongest lobbying entities are at the state level or is the insurance companies are that's probably why are in the in the lead paint built it went from five to ten because basically the insurance companies you know this is\nThe reason I went from five to ten is that the insurance companies or we will be on the hook if it goes to Penn\nBecause the regulations says five let's stay on the I Am saying and I'm trying to make the example just as he did in terms of uh what he was saying it's it it it will be five it's five by regulation ten by law the insurance companies would only be held accountable by the legal aspects\nIs what counselor Crocker was suggesting in terms of how the the the insurance lobbying entity up on the hill control so much\nOf what occurs in our rates is it something that has to change the legislature has to demand it and I would be supportive of doing that as the next state senator\nJust for the record by legislation on lead poisoning actually freezes penalties on insurers\nAnd others so you know my record it and go into that I'm up against big corporate interests um you know it's something I'm I'm I'm proud of I think we have to do more uh but they claim that as you claims on on that I'm somehow in the pockets of a insurers\nIt's just not true we even went back and said All right let's look at every single donor that I've ever had who had any connection to insurers and and we looked at that and we found there's four and adds up to five\nHundred dollars um that to me I I mean clearly him doing a bad job are getting support from an ... I mean the insurance lobbyist if I've only had five hundred dollars in\nCampaign I'm mine is zero All right let's go to another question good evening sir you're doing good evening I'm Seventy one years old so to speak [laughter]\nAnd I'm damn near cripple [noise] I don't see anybody [noise]\nThirty year old carpenter's here they must be home with their kids are asleep early [noise] I\nKind of resent one remark humid recently that the the police chief ... really don't care about this 'cause I was in Frank ... office\nTalking to him here in town when a flash came up on his computer screen from the DEA\nAbove the problem of illegal aliens controlling the drug traffic opiate traffic in this area\nThe Cape cod times wrote a lengthy pays a couple of weeks ago citing the Boston police intelligence unit and the da\nAnd various court streams above the degree to which illegal aliens principally south and Central Americans Dominicans mainly control virtually the entire opioid network that affects our area\nSo comes to my aging brain how can anybody not be rigorous about enforcing our immigration laws and at the same time claim to be concerned about the opiate problem\nQuestions so I take that cost on to me sir so I\nI I agree with you but we should be no and and and my statements have always said\nI have always said we should be we should be targeting felons not families if you're selling if you're commuting felonies only I mean\nBut in in in when our police departments are scraping by to get training on when they are coming to us to ask for our support for that like this is not my my statements\n... my record on message just it's been distorted if you're a felon you know you shouldn't be deported and and those activities that are going place having that\nBut also to create this environment of fear that actually when you talk to law enforcement actually makes our communities less safe because he got folks who are going underground we've actually on Nantucket we've had a really big challenge of overcrowding in housing writes you got\nA two or three bedroom apartment with maybe twenty people living in um which is which is which is a fire hazard it's a public health hazard you know one of the biggest concerns that the police and the public health department can't find anyone who will even come forward and help them take action against\nYou know landlords for exploring exploiting people because no one wants to come forward in this environment of fear so you're trafficking heroin sentinel whatever you know you you deserve to be to board it right you you and that's happening but I think to just characterize that we have\nUm [noise] you know illegal aliens who are roaming Cape Cod spreading a criminality and ... it's just it's just not borne out by the facts\nAnd that's not when I when I get a list of concerns and priorities from our chiefs um that's not that's not on the top of that list and and and I just want to be honest about that John well\nIf it is on the top of the list of the of the street cop or through the endorsement of a Massachusetts coalition of police one of the biggest issues they have\nIs the a number of illegal aliens who are walking the streets of Hyannis walking the streets bringing drugs from the vet said basically selling it on the streets of Cape Cod it's an issue you suggest a Julia that you do support or if you will or I should say you support um basically deporting um\nThose folks that might have a felony but at the same time the contradiction as you did not support the two eighty seven gee program which was the program\nThat was established to basically identify those folks who are here illegally to basically find out whether they do have a felony whether they do have a misdemeanor against them so that they can be deported so how can you contradict yourself that way it doesn't make sense\nIt's my record on public safety I'm so proud of it and I just think it's shameful that John you're relying on this national trumped his rhetoric and bring it\nHere I and and this is not how we not how we do holiday cheer on Cape Cod\nThis is not and you know this is not how Tim Whalen and I work together already hunter and I work together of any of them do you miss you know what I wanted to get out it's not we weren't in the collaborative fashion the eight of us who represent the Cape and the island to deliver results for all if you want to be on the can help\n[noise] last [laughter] okay let's let's let's let's\nThose people my age who are here we we only tend to be here because our families of a foothold here that that is not sustainable when it comes to just supporting your community\nUm and because we're short for time I ... I got to move this along John Yuri ... response I agree with you one hundred\nPercent we need to do everything within our power both at the local level in at the state level\nOr to encourage all types of different um workforce development\nHomes that are affordable for folks who are under the age of thirty under the age of twenty folks that don't kind of for the down payment but I I find that somewhat ludicrous that my my opponent is suggesting that he doesn't have the money he has the hundred thousand dollars to basically buy a house or to buy a condo so that it becomes\nA taxpayer I'm and I'm I'm ... years on\nAh right where I've I've seen the housing ... yes and as we we're way behind we haven't got to the best part yeah were you both get to ask each other question but uh this is\nA young lady has been very persistent so she gets a last question there boy this better be quick and I hope so [laughter] thank you pat\nI'm my name is Laura when I read in Hyannis and um my question is to Julian um you just mentioned that the police are scraping by that were under funded\nYet you voted to approve an Eighteen million dollar pay raise so my question is um what did that vote at your salary in your expense account\nAnd could that money have been better spent and finding some of the programs that we've been talking about this evening\nSo that's a great question and I'm I'm Glad that we just came up in the in the prior debate I'm Glad to answer it again I'm so that ... million dollars was existing resources that have been put aside\nOr was it was no new money right it was money that that were appropriate the legislature I'm so so here ... years I'll walk you through what my compensation was before ... and after a vote so\nActually when they just get it I'm so under the old compensation system or every let us than it receives a compensation of sixty thousand five hundred and forty seven dollars and Ninety seven cents that's a base salary that's based on the constitution it fluctuates based on middle income I'm\n... I Would have received twelve thousand five hundred dollars or an additional share siphons uh so at the time Seventy five hundred dollars for Jared committee a twenty five hundred dollars for the first vice German ship and twenty five hundred for the second vice German ship\n'em ... totaling a salary of Seventy five thousand uh and forty seven dollars and Ninety sometimes uh so what happened was that base salary of sixty two and change stays the same um and it was the chair stipends that were increase they were last established a in the early nineties when I was in a\nSecond or third grade or those were doubled the Fifteen thousand five hundred um and then a ... so that's twenty the like the like apples from twelve thousand five hundred to twenty thousand on the other piece of it as we change how we ... how we are compensated for\nTravel sort of the old system or I Would have received a Seventy five hundred dollars typing for an office and then I Would have received a premium every time I went to the state house\nI Would have probably gone about Seventy two dollars a that was put into a lump sum system so eliminating the podium which the Boston Herald called a quote shady system and frankly some lawmakers were abusing it [noise]\nUm and it went to a lump sum system if you live within fifty miles who said house you get Fifteen thousand dollars for officers and travel you live outside of fifty miles you get twenty\nThousand okay if we can I Apologize no no no I Try to everyone on short for time quick response from\nJoe yeah obviously I thought the uh Eighteen million dollar a first vote as a state senator showed a critical lack of judgment and that was Eighteen million dollars that could come back to the times of God could have some bucks a month is ... and they're talking to support the schools to support for ways to support education\nPublic safety in general elderly\nOr the reason that uh the um the the per diem for travel was changed to twenty thousand dollars was because of the legislature wanted to bundle it as part of a base salary so that ultimately if someone has ten years in the legislature it increases the pension nothing more nothing less that's why it was done\nA Julian can can can spin in any way he wants but when you look at\nThe base salary coupled with ... with the ... for the gym and ships a couple of what the ... for the travel\nOr if you look at the uh the gross a moment comes up to a hundred thousand sixty three dollars and Ninety six cents I mean that's on line you can find that out\nAnd so my point is that the Eighteen million dollars could have been used in a much wiser a much more sane or way of putting it into the pockets of the state legislature\n[laughter] [noise] whenever I fly\nLot of it [noise] I I knew that I Would get flak for this drug\nBut I'm worried about what kind of government that we're going to have and who will serve in the seats up you know I'm worried about that we don't have no seriously guy seriously\nYou know we need to make sure that all people from all backgrounds right are able to serve and I worry about it represented democracy just look at Congress right you can count the congressmen and women on our hands whoever network under a million bucks every Democrat and I think that [laughter]\nNo yet every Democrat not I think Ed Markey to his credit is one of the few senators that has a net worth under that I really worry about that right and so this is about what kind of government we're going to have I knew I get flak for it but I also knew that I work hard but I deliver results from my district and I'm proud of my record\nGood job both [noise] because I don't know if you're a great question which was the most important things to do this evening I'm way way

the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a\nElection day well Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working the way we out\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it's one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy is the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe ...\nInternet is way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage
