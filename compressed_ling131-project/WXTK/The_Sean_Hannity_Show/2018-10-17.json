Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that\nYeah the term to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nAlways tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian ... is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safer at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency reds then\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give out that announcement later in the week\nNow there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my guys are eight\nMillion dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because the Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could of unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you got to think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid terms I have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nI Will tell you I think back then you you hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro quarter in Ninety Days plant dynamite diner\nTricia pick up two bottles of liquor chops get the third bottle free new improved like a chat with them make three omega six vitamin E. and now six extra directed microbial even better for the deck to track and immune system try and liquor chops by to get one free at dynamite dot com\nAnd I'll take\nThe back yard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advice on what home advisor dot com\nYou just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice well how much does it cost ... home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor ...

I'd always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the Kavanaugh hearings with Julie sweating egg I mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis\nYou know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls and these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adults almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ticket fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that\nWith this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly he went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the stories at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find a for people that Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead\nUh to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't do virtually sweating to watch so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story and but also the hunting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that and the minute including pastor Brunson is going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more\n[noise]\n\n\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it was\nReally settling is\nRushing didn't loan payment but you have your green from nova said you at ... college and I\nDon't think you're battling with no education\nColleges and universities play an important role in preventing drug abuse among their to join the drug Enforcement Administration and celebrate red ribbon we from October twenty third\nThrough the thirty first you can plan education and prevention activities on your campus to help ensure that health and safety of our nation's college for more information on how you [noise]\n[noise]\nShaun Hannity jocks of the people involved in the top stories of the day ever\nToday Sean Hannity is on\nMy twenty five now till the top of the hour people asking about what we were comparing earlier in the program direct access to doctors um and of course Obamacare because it seems to be the only one issue now that Democrats want to run on and boy it's such a bad portrayal inaccurate portrayal of what they have\nFor us the pound the country and the differences dramatic it's different in any way we put it up on Hannity dot com you can read it for yourself\nOr as we have a lot of articles up there that you can read or write as promised we got a lot going on eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program Jimmy is in Mississippi will start with you this half hour Jimmy Hi welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nLike you say or it's the talk anyway you talk anywhere alone on ...\nI feel like I Know you've been in my living room so many times in mid run around with me in the car\n[laughter] well they want to know the truth you really do know me you know one thing I've always\nSaid is you really can't fake it for three our four hours a day I mean he may on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain\nWho you really are especially that's why they call radio a warmth medium\n... you're exactly right you're exactly right look shutting the reason that caught ... I was listening on your program yet they find a ... from Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion selling us telling the American people\nThe only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up if Democrats\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince that day Donald Trump\nWon the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then of course you know putting their anarchists symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them\nYou know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen and the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOr ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters Ted said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because if you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian tough the a ... and then had all of our deep stay friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this well Trump said he'd create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation\nAnd opening up bad wire and building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeach but\nThat's the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there's a lot of states [noise]\nThis is Paul UPS guy from all high interest came from

cannot imagine for a second that sentiment to win this race at this point\nSo the Senate is looking good you know my hope is is that three weeks from today when the results are in and we're looking at them I'll be able to say the Republicans have held on to the house because you got up and voted\nAnd you made sure that Nancy Pelosi didn't become the speaker to stop the progress that we've made which is significant\nIn the past two years we now have instead of Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps under Obama eight million more in poverty and no president never went\nTo an attire presidents ... eight years without a single year three percent GDP Growth well I Hope you're going to support the for a million new jobs we've had since Trump selected eight million out of poverty and on for food stamps and he's elected four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest tax cut in history\nThe the greatest amount of deregulation we've ever seen in in five generations in this country including literally now putting in position in place an explosion of American energy independence you know by allowing coal money to continue in West Virginia or Kentucky\nAnd allowing gas to be you know to fracking to take place in allowing add more to be open and pipelines to be built and putting up to ah let's see constitutional is on the Supreme Court in lower courts in the country\nI mean and then of course you know everyone that thought he would start you know little rocket man fire and fury\nMy button is bigger than yours and works of World War three is coming no little rocket man stopped blinked capitulate as hostages home a remains have been sent home or we have nuclear test site shut down and now to talk of denuclearization of the entire peninsula\nOh the president shouldn't challenge our allies in NATO even though they don't pay their fair share that benefits them\nTo have the the NATO alliance far more than us but we're paying Seventy two cents of every dollar and now they're the president say they need to step up and pay their fair share well now they're doing it\nAnd similarly Western European countries that have been unfair with us trade wise or if you don't say that you're gonna have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear of the tariffs has caused them all to negotiate that means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with a Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look what it's done to the steel industry which is seeing a revitalization thank God jobs that are never coming back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs all coming back\nWhy because the president negotiated you want to go backwards ... that's what your choices\nSo we're either going to get together three weeks from today and talk about okay huge wins Republicans hold the house and the Senate or we could talk about huge losses you know you know speaker elect polo see\nUh let's see majority elects Chuck Schumer\nAnd if we can either be talking about cinema losing in Arizona Heller winning in Nevada Joe Donnelly say
