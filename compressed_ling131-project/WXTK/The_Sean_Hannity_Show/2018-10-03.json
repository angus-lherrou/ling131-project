and writers and columnist but it's it's also moved me as I have read these books and to realize I Need to be a better person that's what I read the um like All right I'm a piece of crap and I'm One of the Christians that needs to saving part for sure\n[laughter] so do we own Greg congratulations on your\nUnbelievable success with your book really paying outstanding you\nAll right let me such get into this issue now I asked Lindsey Graham last night and I'll start with you David I said well what if you fall one vote short\nBecause now the the Democrats and the senator from Hawaii the once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigate a nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four\nAnd I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated in every case there's no ... at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on\nAnd this lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever running interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backed tracks on his story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously radon of one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\nI Am ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus have the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a cabin off and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence up and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court they compare his righteous indignation his is to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would have to have that kind of\nIn the sky and how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there is and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete an aunt\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did ah when you're Regis leaves wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and it someplace sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you got\n... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer in the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no face\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit a in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the interview which again the statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and how she well he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead ...\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick\n... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term hits the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing either way and\nThe people know that what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious\nAnd I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss and them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for is fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses in

I understand he has to serve at least three years ago the ten year sentence let's head over to the cell phone good morning colonel is I where are you this morning\nThe morning and in reference to a

life two life sentences do will want to take him up killing and to make a name for themselves so I'm Wondering what is apparently going to do for Bill Cosby to keep him safe\nThey're probably going to put them away from the general public of the prison they're going to take care of them they're going to uh uh they're not going to allow anybody other than the guards and stuff like that near him he's still going to have the ability after thirty days do\nYou know maybe use libraries or do the things that he's going to do and yet they're going to help them around because legally blind [noise] but I

NBC News going forward with\nNot after all this was was absolute ... how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... it's just that Mick party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gets the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that that way\nOh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nByron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have been [noise] but it was given in part a a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least we can see what I think it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just was nothing to this story um and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if

the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on hand so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats would know no matter who Donald Trump s ride they've already against score six yeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell I'm a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona up most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its plans are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you'd spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond doubt I doubt if they're lifting\nI think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe stays couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty did twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled are good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens let\nMe ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm a pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire we\nDon't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made oh we don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off\nBut they have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative and you run
