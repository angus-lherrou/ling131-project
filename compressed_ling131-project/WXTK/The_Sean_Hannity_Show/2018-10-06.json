happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhat really realize today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this\nIs the seriousness the intellect the the systematic\nShe walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly

I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate and deer\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls and the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly in a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or and groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office in destroying her and I'm like

let me ask you this um tell us about management mentioned say yes to\nWell mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes but Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about like

McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge where the Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of new voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats could look ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made the hit\nThe Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them\nIt's called the Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... is coming back in and\nGalileo well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nAll shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but I'll give you a ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs that I'm going to leave the house which I think it can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see\nWhether the effect job and then you are talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's going to tell a very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it in such twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man for support you were saying ...\nDisgusting and everybody who like poor experimenting Arlen and things like that\nDo you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences\nWith the judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archer to Sherry destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nAnd Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug don't make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving\nBut they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape that women are people people weren't right Jordan realize it was a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump\nAnd and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we

I just I Love to be around golf I Love you know I Love to drive a golf cart who doesn't like to drive a golf cart and [noise]\nYou know just go around and and just be happy guy on the course and say Hi to everybody and ah you know nice shot this and that and get a few extra bucks and most importantly play golf or free of course they really what it's all about in the end right if it's free is for me but you know when you [noise]\nAgain this time it thing everyone thinks a okay it's a number it's not a number mhm they redrew time it's not an end game it's a process that's Ken I retired sick a lot of people ... retirement and now to Medicare right sixty five I got to talk about health benefits\nAnd not just just a full time to know time on a part time but part time work can be very fulfilling it can give you a sense of community involvement even if it's part time work when you're not getting paid and you're volunteering and you're out there and you're in that community it's just a good feeling and and for me I guess you know my wife and I host players right for the Boston Braves\nI mean that's a job believe me okay and we love it and and we look forward to those nine or ten weeks that we do it and it really gives a sense of community we have our friends down at the ball field we traveled to other pox we meet all kinds of great people around Cape Cod\nWho share the same passion that we do about the Cape league and uh hosting players and it's really fun and you can make a lot of new friends you can also you know you live a healthier life when you're active we all know this ...\nYou can live longer and healthier by staying busy it's it's actually been proven its effect\nThat doctors talk about when you have a purpose in life and you have a a reason to get up and to go to work even if it's a hobby or if it's part time work you tend to live a longer healthier life I mean that alone should be enough emphasis to get to do it and if that's not it\nHey you know the extra money doesn't hurt either and remember when I talked about earlier time the whole show together here\nWhat if you work part time and that allows you to defer your Social Security an extra two or three or four years and have that guaranteed lifetime checked\nBe worth thirty two percent more for life\nGay for life and that that it's just an unbelievable feeling to have that that higher amount down the road right just by working a little bit so for me um it's so important when people sit down and I actually wrote about this again in in my book she happy retirement which is really the whole process of\nFrom one you're almost that retirement to when you're in retirement it's almost a checklist to to see hey if I'm already retired what was my scorecard how did I Do and what can I still do

trenches and meeting all kinds of people with all kinds of jobs um I Try to put all that knowledge to work in a very kind of easy to understand uh this is not a very intimidating book purposely it's

large Brett Kavanaugh sworn in as the one hundred and second associate justice of the Supreme Court we're coming down a short time ago that Kavanaugh was sworn in by chief justice John Roberts in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court earlier today voting from\nSo called investigation is only been going on for a month or a couple of months I mean they've already moved away from the initial allegations again ... I mean we're not talking seriously anymore about attacks\nOn a on Christine Blasey Ford or any other woman now the allegation is\nHe's a he's a heavier drinkers then he said that he didn't actually\nHe shouldn't be brought up on charges of lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee because he said he liked the beer\nWhen actually he loves beer and eat a little eddies and he is not a guy he he's he doesn't just get sleepy when he drinks he fought he passes out you'll notice he said he got sleeping when he drank mean again\nYou know human being right that's the that's the the effect of alcohol the press on on a human being\nIt depresses yield you get sleepy you fall asleep eventually if you drink enough\nEven Ted Kennedy even Ted Kennedy\nThat's why he needed to do other things other than gray so that he could stay awake to drink more\nWhat Ted Kennedy would think about this ongoing attempt to to have prohibition of straws\nWould require him to have new new ... new twenty dollar bills in his possession at all times anyway\nThis is how outrageous it got though this this weekend the u._s._a. today never great newspaper\nBut it was it was somewhat respectable and it's a day now which is as bad as the New York daily news I mean that there's not even the ... there's never the New York times as bad as it is might\nOccasionally break a story the the Washington Post did good work on the ... a rape case back in the day but what is USA Today ever\nDone in terms of\nAny kind of journalism mean breaking still important news stories it's never done anything\nIt just comes to your when your when you were to marry a hotel or Hyatt hotel on a business trip and you wake up in the morning and you go outside to go down to the continental breakfast and you trip over the paper that has been left for free outside your door that's that's USA Today\nAnd it used to be that they had later scores than the national newspapers but that doesn't but now that you have a cell phone\n... what does it matter if they have later scores of the if they have the west coast games in the in the final additions and I don't even think they have they I don't even like they have all of us have the final a final west coast games or the Monday Night football score\nBut anyway over the weekend they have a they have a sports columnist named Eric Brady that's Eric with a ... this is what he wrote\n... I mean ... how low\nCan these people go I Want you to think about this before I read this to you the U.S Senate\nMay yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around\nThe nation is deeply divided sometimes would feel like feels like we don't agree on anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nHow how twisted you have to be the right that and and and how how ... have to do his editors have to be to let that Ron credibly accused\nThere's there's there's no one supporting any of these stories\n\nThat the Yale expose exposure story the New York times wouldn't touch that story they said they couldn't they they interviewed dozens of people no one no one back that up\nThe gang rape story that was put out by the creepy porn lawyer that's even more preposterous\n\nThis is Mollie Hemingway and the federal is the article which was illustrated with a picture of Kavanaugh and one of the girls basketball team see coaches has since been dramatically revised\nApparently editors at USA Today belatedly ... calling a human being a pedophile with perhaps precisely zero actual evidence of any sexual propriety was indefensible\nBut this is why this is what they're up against you you know\nSaid this before and I think he's right but the the sports media\nIs even more detached from reality than the the political press corps\nYou know at at least a few not an effort declining percentage of people on in the uh Washington press corps have actually covered the real world you know they've actually been outside the beltway\nBut the sports media it's it's all jocks never re and ah and licks peddling and a sucking up the athletes and ah and ... and they they want to be PC they ... they want when do you think of what Brian James is impressed with this yeah\nSome tells me he's not who who may be Colin Kaepernick but as we as we\nNow know I mean what does the ... Smith said he doesn't even think Colin Kaepernick wants to come back to football anymore 'cause you making too much money as a a spokesman for Nike\nWho's who's impressed with this credibly accused he calls Brett Kavanaugh credibly accused sex offender what do you have to do to get to get Sean by by respectable\nPeople and if these are credible accusations and what are incredible accusations\nYeah ... I mean really what [laughter]\nYeah what is it what is a what would you not believe if they let me put it this way Eric Brady do you believe Juanita Broderick deeply Paula Jones you believe Kathleen ... you believe in the ... do you believe uh the uh\nMonaghan woman out in Minnesota who says Keith Ellison attacked her do you believe those ... those a teenage prostitutes in Dominican Republic who said they had sex with Sen Menendez do you believe any of those people or do you only believe people who accused Republicans\nAnd and more importantly people who were\nNominated by Donald J Trump aide

you've heard the latest a senator Mazie Hirono her bono from Hawaii he wants to be at once an FBI investigation as to whether or not Brett Kavanaugh was a very belligerent\nDrunks so [laughter] you know belligerence was a crime and\n[noise] um well I'm just concerned I Want them to get into the farting jokes\n[laughter] someone else has called for that I think it was Hillary Clinton actually know this this is so crazy particularly I'm considering how what their their record is when they go after what what the left deems white frat boys\nI'm a Duke lacrosse you will have um the Rolling Stone story about UVA we add mattress girl at Columbia\nI'm there for the hell abort Halliburton loud in Iraq ... gang rapes Jamie Lee Jones and put her in a shipping container all of these for one hundred percent believed by Democrats they brought it and Jamie Lee Jones to to the Senate passed a law\nIn her honor um she was on you know good morning America believed every place you went by the Democrats and the media\nUm I Can't think of one where where it was actually true they have a very bad record on this now it's down to groping\nI'm an allegation of groping with no corroborating witnesses the witnesses the the accuser names all deny being there right\nThere but then you got your body so they have to get into the farting jokes and anytime he ever drank beer\nHave you ever ... have you seen the picture of a Sheldon Whitehouse and on the Internet and he's asking the question did you not far in high school\n[laughter] yes I think Brett Kavanaugh when when the war for best trolling of liberal [laughter]\nYou know in the ... this is really moving in the same direction as the Russia probe because there's there is no more Russia and the Russia probe\nRight and the groping is going away now we're coming into the ... is he did he lie to the Senate when he just said he liked the beer when he loves to be here and now we're moving\nOn and now we're even moving on beyond that to his being he spends charged with being belligerent\n'em and all this from a party that defended a rapist Bill Clinton um while he was governor not not not even you know back when he was Fifteen Years old based on a recovered memory I'm as governor Whitman it out to Paula Jones\nUm and I mean I have this going on simultaneously with Keith Ellison a Democrat member of Congress\nOn his mistress who called nine one one at the time claiming that he beat her and I don't know not a peep about that\nYeah I Know and and women do not deserve to be believed\nAnd ... what about the charges against US Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and I'm not talking about the corruption charges I'm packing right off the charges in the Daily Caller a couple of years ago about what he was doing down on those Dominican vacations but the ophthalmologist from West Palm was providing for a mug route us in return for bringing his\nHis mistress was into the country with a green cards you know you know that\nMuch I think is admitted the only thing that was disputed what was the the prostitutes and the child sex but as her being as Mr says although on the media may not care but it's starting to look like\nThe voters may care I mean incumbent oughta when especially a Democrat in a very liberal state like New Jersey but I just saw some polls showing his Republican opponent is in a dead heat with him now he may end up winning in the end but that's quite a statement to have an incumbent Democrat in New Hampshire\nNew Jersey and New Jersey New Jersey even having to think about his reelection\nRight so so today a and you saw the president of the er at the trade press conference of course they weren't actually been preyed yeah they just want to you and you knew you knew you were just watching to see the first question would not be about trade or about this great victory\nOr it would be about Brett Kavanaugh's or how many beers ... the ah the keg party at the the house in a you know in Nineteen eighty three and and\nBut I'm actually glad it sorry go ahead\nBut what he says so so then so then he said the Trump says and you watch the thing I said I've seen some Democratic senators and some pretty compromising position yeah no they go when they get a bad ice skill you know and uh so so\nNow the left to say is he trying to black male our esteem the wire makers they're they're angry but\nI'm really glad they did ask them about Cavanaugh I I'm I was thinking of treating up and I was busy I'm ... I Hope Republicans are watching this is how it's done\nI was so happy when he turned it back on the Democrats and when asked for specific oh he gave specific they gave us effects it out you know my last year you senator from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal a lying about his Vietnam service for four hours and\n... and die five holding\nHolding this woman's account for for for what two months that seriously she took it um he actually went through the these scandals involving the Democrats and that is what the Republicans should do Everytime turn it right back on these guys because what they have done oh my gosh if only the worst they could be accused of\nThe congressman from El Paso I guess he's that's where he's for help", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "West Yarmouth", "day": "06"}
