we have some follow the investigations I mean I really like to know um who leaked the letter from Christine forward to the press who did that apparently Dr Ford did not want to become public\nSo who leaked it is only a few people added a congresswoman in California and Dianne Feinstein I'm\nSo that shouldn't be too hard to find out who lead that and I think everybody should know and also the FBI to follow up on 'em you know threats a\nFinances behind demonstrators who are now a costing people in restaurants in elevators they're being paid the same people that attacked me a couple of years ago\nAre involved with this cabinet thing same groups and they're being paid they're funded I'd like the FBI to look into that because you don't want dangerous and that's threatening\nYou know I I I mentioned this a couple of times the last couple of days the wall Street Journal reported yesterday that\nThey knew it was great was that you have a great article that was\nThe woman who yeah hundred the woman who accosted just like in the elevator that friday and I'm On in the capital is paid a hundred and Seventy seven thousand dollars a year by a\nPlus a bonus yeah she gives them the eyes you got a bonus for getting like in the elevator noticed when he's around his\n[laughter] isn't that isn't that amazing I mean a headache and you know including no money no they're yeah\nYou know call up the Boston Globe and say hey ah would you do an article and George Soros and all of the organizations he's funding that go up to people and scream at them and\nTry to disrupt our uh our nominating process for the Supreme Court could you send a couple of spot light people over\nTo try to check that out your\nBill you don't even need to send the spotlight people I mean we you know we founded yesterday we we you know it's the story was behind a pay wall so we just pull the IRS up filing maybe they have to it it's a it's a quote unquote nonprofit group so they her salaries just listed right there on the Internet\nRight but nobody cares in the mainstream night to use that word but the national media they don't care\nThey don't care they don't think the truth anymore how he I looking for the big story who engineered all this stuff against Kavanaugh I'll tell you what when I saw the first day that Dr Christine forward hired\nThe most radical left law firm in Washington DC that send off a few signals to me\nBecause if you're in a salt victim is thirty six years ago that's not really who you go to go to a forensic attorney and go to somebody who was is familiar with the criminal laws that's who you go to you don't go to the most radical progressive attorneys in the United states\nSo as soon as I saw it I went whoa whoa this is far more than just an accusation\nAbout what happened and you know back in the Nineteen nineties and that was proven to be correct\nAll right let's talk about your book killing the ss or the hunt for the word I criminals in history and again you got you you get kind of lucky but uh you know they are all these stories of the New York papers that Hitler's last relatives living out on Long Island but I Know\nI live right near me they really are wearing a\nBowling league um it's the third Reich versus [laughter] um these poor people and you know they're trying to get away they change their names and everything and some German magazine tracks him down look killing the ss a is about evil and I wrote the book because there's so much evil on display in the United states and all over the world\nToday people need to understand what it is\nBy the ss garb that brutalized and murdered babies and women are millions of them were merchants farmers bankers they didn't go to a hate college they didn't go to a slaughter school they were normal German before World War two started\nThe banality of ... name of a famous book right\nThat's right and and you know we're seeing evil in the United states we see people walk into schools gunning down children we see thousands of people shot on the streets of Chicago by drug gangs and the authorities can stop it we see clerics harming children\nAre all three boys I mean this is evil and my mother you lived a very nice life and she never encountered evil didn't understand it never saw it\nI don't think that's a good thing I think people should know there is evil in the world and there's no better display of evil\nThan these S. S. concentration camp Holocaust people like I meant and mango and born in and Barbie and how they got away and who will help them it's an outrageous story\nOr are we allowed the book around the ... or any of them left alive you think\nWell this is an interesting story there is a woman who is living in San Francisco for forty years one of the worst concentration camp guards ever in a place called Robbins Brooke I'm In Germany she got to the United states married a Jew\nLiving in San Francisco and the state department found her a few years ago center back to Germany where she's still alive receiving every monthly ready a U.S Social Security check\nOkay\nThere are thousands of these people still alive\nAnd you know Americans we the younger generation now you know this I don't know anything that I taught this in school they're not taught that ordinary people can turn into monsters and it doesn't take a lot\nAnd you know you go back to the cabinet and stuff and you have a a

live and the kids to\nRoad and Ronan Farrow with Jane Mayer the who wrote the piece on Ramirez who had no corroboration either the\nYale scores she they said they were trying\nTo show a pattern well you you know\nAs as I said in the last segment bill I mean how was showing a pattern any different from say racial profiling you know you have a pattern of bad behavior among when you say in is in a group of people so you go after\nThat this is they they were doing the same thing with Kavanaugh there were ... they had no evidence they call dozens of people they could turn up anything\nBut they wanted to show the pattern it's just going out to Iowa\nOr writing to the Boston Globe and reporting for channel seven back in the eighties if we bought the cabin a story into our editors it never would have made a paper or me there no\nOkay never I mean we couldn't go in and say hey hey hey let's let's let's paid on somebody's accusation and put it in the paper or on TV and maybe somebody else

Ninety five WMGK\nNine three six eight that's five eight to one seven nine three six eight or you can go to our website and register for this\nA complementary no obligation personal retirement exposure review it Cape retirement radio dot com that keep retirement radio dot com and that of course we know people are living longer as they are\nYes the new research in an asset sufficiency is challenging some of the standard retirement planning rules or some such as that\nFour percent safe withdrawal rate sixty five year old married couple of retiring today will likely the at least one spouse live longer than Thirty years\nAnd that's that's incredible of five years old so for him I mascara and I'm a math\nGuy or math guy but ah so that's a little startling and thinking about you know people may be used to think that they'd be retired for Fifteen or Twenty years now thirty\nExactly I have a you know I've talked to him my uncle dying at Ninety nine a few months shy of is a century which are incredible my mom uh she's not listening so I can\nTell her age [laughter] oh shut she'll be she'll be Ninety next July and uh the way her health and everything I Would expect her to be um be here for a long time [laughter]\nAnd um so I see it I just mentioned visiting my father in law last week in Wisconsin meaty some turning into eighty eight in March you guys have good genes [laughter] like I say there's more and more with my own clients and their parents and I have clients are and then you know miles calling us Ninety now so\nYou know I I see you're seeing this more and more and more and you mentioned there for several which is\nInteresting um before present rules basically if you have a million dollars you can generate four percent or or forty thousand out of that is a safe income yeah number that you won't want to run out of money in retirement that the million dollars not that the corporate should be there but that it'll last year that Thirty years it's\nA we mentioned challenging times I mentioned how you're being really mess of the other two things that we have that are are very challenging for retirees today is uh when we have a stock market that is the highest it's ever been to every one number two is the longest running but marking history\nSo that um leads you to believe that from a tiny perspective if you're if you're retiring next couple of years we've got to be pretty careful because if you stay on the market is a chance if you if you don't put the right wrist measures in place that you could start off a ticket to step backwards or two which while you're taking an income\nSo you know if you have a million dollar ... a portfolio and you lose ten percent and nine hundred and you're taking out the four percent of the million another forty\nOkay I Can't do the metro corporate probably taking about Seventeen percent out of your portfolio and\nYou you know and then next year you're taking out another forty thousand which is\nGoing to be a higher percentage rate than the four percent or any of the market to rebound and if it doesn't have had to go down and ... again yeah in in recent memory I mean this happened in two thousand\nTwo thousand and ten and a lot of people get wiped out so that is a concern so it's very important that you do it a a ... with some real you know proper a planning in addition to that uh interest rates interest rates are the lowest they've been in history than just\nRose rates the or the other day and likely to do ... do it again in December\nBut in a hot a rising shrink environment I asked the class it's going to be completely devastated as the bond market and so what people do when they get older they get out of our own on and so the four percent\nA distribution rule yeah it was a very difficult one to project based on the current market environment\nAnd so I might say to you that it's you know a a safer number might be three percent and you're going to say I said a million dollars that I can only see if we take out thirty thousand dollars a year that doesn't make any sense and they find there are ways you can take 'em or on a on a guaranteed basis which I could show you what if you're going to be in the market\nIn a mixture of sixty percent stocked with forty percent bonds or fifty fifty that type of thing that is what that four percent rule applies to and so you're ... you know you really need to be careful that average written an article for fortune and which I can assure what people when you come in\nAbout the specific a piece and um it's it's a it's a real struggle because it's really hard to generate the income that you need\nIn the current conditions and that's what I'm an expert in ... and so that's why I invite you to come in and we'll see how much income can generate for you\nAnd that is what you for for people who might just be joining us to the first time a today that's your specialty is risk management in retirement ...\nExactly you know risk management is the number one thing you have to focus on\nMost people get it meaning most people say when they retire as funny like five years before retirement [noise] they'll take all the risk in the world or or you know they perceived to parse this is their only you've of retirement there like I don't want to lose any of them you know it's\nTrue it it it yeah I can see people in that position\nBut you can't go into CDs or two percent either right so a ... or you're not going to have the retirement that you ... you know you're expected certainly if you're going to present a CD and\nYou're taking for summer draws you lose the money every year so that's not good are you also have to come combat inflation ... so that four percent withdrawal rate you also want more money more money each year you may be at a three percent inflation or rate\nTo to tackle that those extra um\nHigher rising costs so it it it's a delicate or a planning process yeah but at the end of the end of the day I can show you how to do it\nWith the wrist managed management being the number one thing top of mind so that and I could project out to you how are you going to do a project how you're going to do right now based on what you're doing and then by making one little tweak or change\nOr which I Do for people to show you how you can do it if you do it my way\nAll right uh listeners out there

and I leave her in the lead to a happier and more sustainable retirement\nThis radio [noise]\nWelcome everybody to have retirement radio I'm highly current and I'm here with ...\nFounder of Cape retirement wealth advisors and if you're not familiar with Cape retirement less advisors they are a business that focuses on retirement income planning Asset Management Social Security Medicaid and estate planning you know an estimated ten thousand baby boomers\nTurn sixty five every day in higher income individuals you know there are often better health at retirement they're going to face a longer lifetime\nA health costs as they live longer a planning for these higher costs will be challenging but we know it's very important right\nExactly I mean it's one of these things where ... years and years and years ago I mean I often say a top three things we're facing now is retirees are pre retirees are it's going to be it's harder than it's ever been to retire\nYou mentioned a health care costs knows one big question mark and as an advisor is difficult to plan for because you have no idea what the costs are going to be always really him go up and up and up and up and up and up so you can only do your best\nYou're right now I talk about this all the time for the best one study each year and the most recent one that was done last year they're estimating a retired couple sixty five to ...\nSeventy five thousand dollars in out of pocket expenses in retirement that form ... retirement I'm Talking to health care so that's expenses after Medicare\nAnd comedy solar under that assumption that well I'm sixty five I'm On Medicare now sell I'm fine how about\nMedicare doesn't cover everything I mean you know I'm not going to get into the minutia of Medicare but it doesn't cover everything and you really better get yourself educated on what it does and does not cover any want to look at your your own health because you know maybe you have a a certain situation where he taken certain drugs yeah and you might want to get some kind of other supplemental plan\nA prescription plan or other health care plan a supplemental because of the things that you require money might be extremely extremely expensive that just you know going to\nAdd into that two hundred and Seventy five thousand so it's a it's a really really big deal [noise] I mean people all the time and a A R fifty five result they don't have three hundred thousand zero two hundred and Seventy thousand saved yet and that and they're just for health and ... yeah but they're just trying to save for\nIncome in retirement to replace that paycheck yeah you know this above and beyond that so it's a real crisis for these retirees will be going forward it's something that [noise]\nGovernment to government intervention is going to have to play a part at some point in this and um that remains to be seen how that works out in the meantime you just need to be aware of it part of that is\nYou know a nursing home to across you know or assisted living or um long dark hair yeah that kind of assistance and so there are things you can actually take care of now or two\nBut you know leverage some of the monies that you have him into something that can help combat that ah those costs of them can example let's say I mean I see this all the time\nPeople are what are called lazy money lazy money's money that is you know they all have a CD thousand in a in a CD or savings account for a rainy day that's never coming just don't know what to do with it [noise] so there are a insurance products life insurance specifically which allow you to\nTake then depending on your age or if you're sixty sixty five whatever the hunter may turn into a death benefit or a\nBenefit towards large from church type ... long term care type costs you know you might turn that into four hundred thousand five hundred thousand and now we just lovers a hundred and we took a big chunk out of the two Seventy five that we needed right yep and and uh people do this all the time because here now that money\nIs being used for something and then this case insurance into leverage against the possibility that you knew this type of coverage nothing I I like about it is\nLet's say you don't need that coverage well eventually we'll pass away so you don't all go to nursing homes and those types of things but he passed away\nAnd there's a return unload those dollars you'd get a death benefit and that goes to your surviving spouse or Arabs for your state which is great planning which is also lining so a lot of times um you know I mean people every week now\nI find that they have this and then I talked to him about planning because they typically don't have anything else in place\nTo help combat some of these costs so they're happy to part with this money yeah uh in order to do this in a lot of these products to by the way I'm there called return a premium so for example I mean you put that a hundred thousand you had the protection I said it was losing money wasn't Danny\nBut if you decided six years from now you want to I don't know God Forbid by boat or ... return to Premera laws you take that hundred thousand out anyway really are so without any kind of penalty heard of that type of that\nSo it is it you know the idea is that you probably are not going to buy a boat but you could always grabbing hands on it if you absolutely needed it\nWhich actually gives a person for peace of mind exactly making this kind of a decision\nMost of the time when you talk about insurance or almost anything commitment is hard for people yeah you know church where people for a lot of reasons they they want to be able to feel touch see their money and able to access at any time I completely understand that I'm no different but in order to get a certain things\nOr an accomplished certain things sometimes you have to make a commitment in this case and these types of products just there are some of them are that are out there that have that return a premium offering so you're really not too many to anything but you're just making more better use your money in the meantime while you're waiting for that rainy day that probably won't happen happen\nAll right if any of our listeners out there have from me the money and they really wanted to start working for them\nI a highly recommend that you and give us a call and you can go in for a complementary no obligation\nPersonal retirement exposure previews he can look in the way you have that lazy money and he can give you options of what you can
