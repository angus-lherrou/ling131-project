{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXTK", "content": "I wasn't in a cruise last winter I think I talked about before mhm oh look around there are plenty of folks there\nAre a good portion of them you know in their eighties now a lotta people I talked to said well I'm an eighties I'm going to slow down aren't going to do anything that would all if you have your health yup you're going to be doing those types of things whether it's cruising or whatever it is but you will be doing it and are enjoying yourself so\nA age ... you know ... ages real funny thing go my mom's eighty nine I mean she's on the cruise with you know she did a\n... you know a she thinks she's too young for cruises oh well you know she probably\nIs if you're very useful you know I went on their burrows [laughter]\nBut you know she uh she's still very active I mean and and do some traveling um and uh uh ... you know nothing\nSeems to be slower than slowing down so you know God Bless her\nYeah well as we know worry about health and health care you know that is something that we all you know think about it the big retirement fear forty four percent of workers\nAre worried about declining health that requires long term care obviously they weren't going to the gym four to five times a week [noise] thirty eight percent are concerned about a lack of access to adequate and affordable health care that's something that everyone you see it in the in the headlines every day\nThirty five percent fear cognitive decline dementia and or Alzheimer's disease so those\nAre all real real issues and I see it all the time yet or if it's not my clients is their parents yeah and so you know the the result of that is is this a we talked about life insurance earlier how it can be used for protection yup as your family you know you have a family and that type of thing how can be used in retirement\nYou can also be used to help offset some of these costs\nAre associated with these types of things so if you end up going into a nursing home and need funds you can borrow against your death benefit to cover these expenses so you know I'm the health insurance aspect of things it's ... it's you know the government has to figure this out Rob because\nEverything's skyrocketing it's one of the most difficult thing is a a planner a retirement plan to plan for and you know we talk about that study you're going to be two hundred and Seventy five thousand out of pocket after insurance\nCovered you know after medic a Medicare people look at me and they like their ours pop up the day and they're easy not and they think they go you know they fail um and ah you know I'm Sorry this was this something that kind of happen overnight\nWith a you know the Ford oval CARE Act which become the most unaffordable care we can we can have so or someone has to be fixed but in the meantime you have to be prepared and protect yourself because you can't rely on local stand to do it\nNow and we know the health care costs don't appear to be coming down at all at\n... level out or inflation just you know just a couple of percent a year but I mean these policies are ... you know premiums are going up you know twenty thirty forty fifty percent a year in some cases\nAnd Chris you know we talked a lot about insurance and um I I shouldn't occur to me during the break what if someone already had insurance\nOh

All right what airline did you fly what can the aircraft in where did you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and this trip is from Newark to Singapore and saying that since coming back\nUm it's more than Ninety five hundred miles and basically um to the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus\nEight three fifty dash nine hundred jet I'm it's configured for ultra long flying or they've Airbus has modified fuel system um they restricted the cargo load a little bit on it\nUh and uh and it can um uh they say it's a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is scheduled at Eighteen hours forty five minutes a day when I did it we had some favorable in so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplane [laughter] and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats are you you wrote in your column that's their sixty seven business class of Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on on line for a company with your column the seats look fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus a seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particularly with the international airlines and and what we think of is economy plus or the extra leg where you get on the domestic us airlines on premium economy on on on Singapore\nUm and and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to what somebody into a small fee for eight hours\nUm but ... so this she has a ... inch more ... than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches inside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches um and in about six extra inches of leg room you get a little bit more recline\nAnd it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that dissimilar to what business class used to be long before the flat bed\nRevolution I'm so it's\nYou know it it was a comfortable seat um Singapore actually has um a specially designed that seat with some features for this particular flight is for ultra long flying um whether extra support for your for your cab as your legs they said well I'm\nA reduced tension but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane um and I know many people\nCan see an end was the flight ... was I was full I mean it's interesting what the premium\nCounty feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of spacious before seats in the middle so you've got\nTo middle seats in the middle of the airplane and I think the people in that middle section in particular you know that kind of trip where uh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific tips we only have about the ... you have some sort of gets which\nIs drink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right\nYeah I think that's really important really important for circulation really important for the um it it\nIt and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours to go you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie\n... it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking coffee and tea and particularly herbal teas and and things and and we think of that is sort of a direct that you know ... maybe D hydrate you\nUm but in this case the recommendation is a drink coffee and tea because it forces you to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is a good thing that gets you up and moving around on the other thing I think is really important and and this goes for really any flight but particularly long flights if if your contact lens or anything bring I drops\nAnd and bring US Sailing nasal spray you have to do you can stay much healthier on an airplane if you keep your nostril moist um the the mucus membranes up there that the trap infection\nI'm inside very little bottle salient spray very little bottle I drop so stick them in the feedback pocketed in and use of them\nAre really every time I get up and walk every two or three hours\nI appreciate that 'cause I've never done that all good advice and you survived the trip obviously did round trip out and you're back home and Dallas every Thursday Scott writes a fascinating column even if you don't fly a lot it's really interesting it's called the middle seat it's in the wall Street Journal every Thursday you can also find it online if you're subscribers of the journal\nScott thank you so much for dropping by as always with a interesting stuff stick with us we'll

bad this thing was you know that's how you found out I don't\nKnow actually we had picked up the papers because she had sent out a\nA fundraising letter which she uh\nLifted registrar age which is the correct term for that position so we said let's look at our papers to the itchy elephant nomination papers have the incorrect a term for that position but they weren't they were correct so they were just sitting at a table tell a\nVolunteer actually just picked up and started flipping through the pages and then claimed it out you know there's more problems than that and then we recognize some of that names that appear to be incorrectly listed a written and\nWe started calling them and the first ten people all said those are not our signatures\nThat Maria that he had a ten dollar ten it's a pretty good pretty high rate of uh problems [laughter] that's\nWhat when you thought and then we immediately started to pull things together that we had had concerns ever since we have a Stephanie Barry wrote an article out here describing Mr ... being at\nThe end a restricted area of the courthouse and campaign uh being her campaign manager\nThis guy and he always for most people even in Springfield I don't even know if they remember Frank ... this guy is the political operative who's running a Cheryl a\nShovel a Coakley ... campaign he who we he's a he's a jail bird is the ...\nAh yeah he served jail time and has conducted felonies\nAnd that's why labor concern here he was in certain areas of the court house according to the article but other things started to come up from the campaign they're looking at the finance fake campaign finance report and uh so that we realize the rules were always be all out by our opponent\nBut we never imagined he would find what we did when they picked up those papers\nI'm an organized or you'll be I'm looking at the story in the Republican it's a spray keel was remained a potent figure in local politics despite spending three years in federal prison federal prison for policing a taxpayer funded homeless shelter he wants to win and Springfield\nSee any relation to the hassle and family member\nI I don't doubt it\nI never met Frankie out but um I let you right in the paper is what I read in the paper a when a myth bury a started to do the investigation\nSo I mean so what do you go to I mean how do you I mean again this is a this is far down on the on the ballot\nMost people you know or you know not even sure what the register of deeds does until they buy a house or how to how to get how do you get the word out to people about what's been going on in this ... this fight\nWell I think the important thing is that we do start discussing that because registered the signatures ladder [laughter] you can't just have an e signatures on transfer gate details and the rule of law are essential to the uh position so I think even though it's tied the pat China's past\nAh we still have to discuss the fact that the rules were not followed when it was a ... writing they nomination papers and then also it's very important for us to talk about\nThe actual fact what actually happened to some people people's identities were taken that was portrayed and those people have the right to have their some sort of resolution to that problem so that will probably go beyond\nIn regards to the election but we have to address both those issues and the most we can do is just start talking about it\nSo I I mean are these are the are the people whose signature who claim their signatures were stolen or are they going to ... are are they going to seek a criminal complaints here\nAre that's really up to them and they have standing we don't have standing in regards to that the only thing we can do is we have to ask the secretary state to do an investigation not only in what happened here but also how can this not happen in the future because it it was a with\nThe secretary state was told a local town clerk's you don't make that decision but then it wasn't being made at the secretary of state's office so that probably has to be some safeguards put into place as regards to the campaign where asking for poll watchers to command a we feel the irregularities that came out of the ah\nSignatures in Springfield office uh will help trigger that and asking for poll watchers and unfortunately we're also asking for the recusal of the registrar or voters for this election because she is the former assistant to share a ... there\nWere ... have you challenge the coke we revert to a debate to to explain how how all these uh allegedly fraudulent signatures ended up on her nomination papers\nWell we asked for with Asperger's debates numerous times a campaign forums as she has not agreed to any of that she finally had agreed to a debate which will be friday afternoon twelve thirty well into the end of the early voting period\nAnd that will be out on channel twenty chin is and I look forward to asking a numerous questions in regards to how she's been running her campaign from whether it to her campaign manager as to uh the campaign finance reports and then finally the issue for the signatures\nFriday twelve PM I'm ... I'm guessing you're I'm guessing the debate will be ending friday at one PM so you're going to get you're going to get a whopping thirty minutes\nOf that really that there was no candidate grams residents don't and voters don't have a right to ask her questions which is disappointing I always look for a Jew a candidate forums where we can really hear what questions\nAre Marie Marie and Julie these you're you're an attorney from long about a ... where can people go to learn more about your campaign for register each\nA Murray M.
